Well, it’s all about the traversal: Laika expertly blends motocross gameplay with more traditional Metroidvania mechanics, doing away with segmented rooms and corridors in favour of sprawling, interconnected landscapes. You’re specifically encouraged to travel at high speeds, launch yourself into the air, and pull off badass flips that will have Trials fans giddy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It quickly gained a cult following, leading to a short series of free DLC chapters and the announcement of a sequel. Now that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is finally here, we’re pleased to report that one-person team Gareth Damian Martin of Jump Over The Age hasn’t lost a step—this new release is everything that the first game was and then some.\nCitizen Sleeper 2 cold opens with your conveniently amnesiac character waking up in the clutches of a gangster boss named Laine giving you an angry speech about his claim of ownership over your synthetic body. Before he can literally pull the plug on you and bring about a very swift Game Over, a mysterious ally spirits you away in a small, stolen starship. Your saviour claims to know you and, knowing that Laine will be painting a target on both your backs, you make for a nearby station to hopefully find the resources needed to disappear and earn your freedom.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.\nThe developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

          "description": "Assassin's Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.\nI've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them?

Archetype Entertainment.\nSummerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times.

This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

Simply pour over molten ichor and leave to stand - you'll know they're ready to eat when you can no longer hear yourself weeping. \"Ready to eat\" is a phrase that cuts two ways, of course - and what better way to accompany being eaten by Mawflakes than by reading about this week's new PC games.\n Read more",

Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. \nRead more",

The island will be available for a limited time, and you can find 23 different items to dig. Along the way, you can obtain different types of gifts, and let's find out how to obtain them.\n\n\nBest way to obtain Gift of Enchants, Hearts, and Skies in Dig It\n\n\nAs I said, Valentine's Island has 23 new diggable items for you to find. The Gift of Enchants, Hearts, and Skies are on the same list, which means you can dig them up as well. Do note that they can be dug till the event is live, as Valentine's Island isn't a permanent POI in Dig It.\n\n\nThere is another way to obtain the three gifts, but that will involve you to spend real-life cash.\n\n\n\nThe Gift of Enchants cost R$149.\n\n\nThe Gift of Hearts cost R$499.\n\n\nThe Gift of Skies cost R$699.\n\n\n\nYou can try this way (using Robux), but I believe that you should try it out in an inexpensive way (digging on the island and hoping to get lucky).\n\n\n\n\nGift of Enchants, Hearts, and Skies contents in Dig It\n\n\nThe Gift of Enchants can now be opened inside the game as we are past February 2. Gift of Heats can be opened on February 5, while Gift of Skies can be opened on February 8. Thankfully, we already know the contents of all three types of gifts.\n\n\n\nGift of Enchants: Contains Legendary rarity Mole.\n\n\nGift of Hearts: Contains a shovel\n\n\nGift of Skies: Contains an Air-Balloon\n\n\n\nIf you're confused about all the items that can be found on Valentine's Island, make sure to check this guide out. Remember that the island has been added for a temporary period, so you should hurry and get the complete set of items before the island goes away.\n\nThe post How to get the Gift of Enchants, Hearts and Skies in Dig It appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The latest update of Anime Adventures has introduced the Assassins Contracts Event inside the game, and you can earn different rewards from your grind.\n\n\nThe event has its exclusive token currency, which will help you unlock all the available rewards. The highlights are the new units that are exclusively part of the Assassins Contracts Event. To unlock them, you'll have to earn as many event tokens as possible.\n\n\nBest ways to farm Assassins Contracts Event tokens in Anime Adventures\n\n\nThe Assassins Contracts Event can be accessed from the main screen of Anime Adventures. You'll find the event icon on the right side of your screen. Once you click on it, you'll find different contracts that are open. These are objectives that you'll have to complete to get the rewards.\n\n\nYou can also create your own game, which can be played with a stranger or exclusively with your friends. Ideally, it will be better to complete the harder contracts as they will offer you better rewards. However, make sure to take on objectives that are feasible for you to complete.\n\n\n\n\nBest ways to use Assassins Tokens in Anime Adventures\n\n\nTo earn Assassins Tokens, you'll have to complete the objectives. These tokens are best used on the event-exclusive banner, which has its own set of limited-time units. Additionally, we might get new items in the shop in the future that will be purchasable using these tokens. Either way, I genuinely feel that using the currency to summon new units will be the best use.\n\n\nThe shining lights of the event banner are the three featured Mythic units: Somber, Killstreak, and Legendary Assassin. If you manage to get lucky and pull a Mythic, there's a 33% chance for one of the three to spawn. There's the usual pity rate as well for those who won't get the rub of good luck.\n\nThe post How to complete Assassins Contracts Event in Anime Adventures appeared first on Destructoid.",

These six creatures are the hardest ones to catch, and they're not even part of the official bestiary. Let's take a look at how you can obtain them inside the game. Originally, there used to be three of them, but the recent Atlantic and Orcas update have doubled the numbers. \n\n\nHow to catch all six secret fish in Fisch\n\n\nAs of the latest Oil Rig/Orcas update, there are six fishes to catch.\n\n\nFish\nType\nLocation\nPreferred Bait\nSeason\nWeather\n\n\n\n\nBanana Fish\nSecret\nAncient Isle\nNone\nSummer\nRain\n\n\nLong Pike\nSecret\nOcean Territory\nInsects\nAutumn, Spring\nRain\n\n\nMustard Fish\nSecret\nOcean Territory\nSea Weed\nSummer\nRain\n\n\nResin\nSecret\nMushgrove Swamp\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\n\nAncient Kraken\nSecret\nAtlantis (Kraken's Pool)\nTruffle Worm\nNone\nNight\n\n\nAncient Orca\nSecret\nOcean (Arch)\nShark Head\nNone\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greatest difficulty of getting the secret fish is their spawn rate. They're not part of the official bestiary, which means that you're not supposed to find them inside the game. The Banana Fish, for example, is only meant for admins and partnered content creators. Yet, you might get lucky and land one with the correct setup.\n\n\nThankfully, you don't really need the very best rods to land them. You should fully focus on Season, Weather, and Bait, along with the locations. The odds of landing these fish are low, to begin with. Without the preferred setup, it will be next to impossible to catch these creatures, irrespective of your rod and player levels.\n\nThe post How to get all secret Fishes in Fisch (Orcas Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

This event will allow you to capture the Ancient Orca, but there are certain strategies you'll have to keep in mind.\n\n\nSecret Ancient Orca location in Fisch\n\n\nThe Ancient Orca is one of the three available Orca types you can catch in Fisch. It can only be caught during the Orca Migration Hunt Event, and you'll have to travel to the Arch. This location is situated at the following coordinates (XYZ: 1100, 133, -1200).\n\n\nThe Orca Migration Hunt Event is a server event, and it will take place randomly. Additionally, not every hunt will have the Ancient Orca spawning in them. Try to look for \"Ancient Orcas Migration (100% Guarantee)\" on your screen. Once you find that marker, you'll have to fish in the areas surrounding the Orcas.\n\n\n\n\nBest setup for Ancient Orca in Fisch\n\n\nThe Ancient Orca doesn't have stiff requirements, and they can spawn at any time of the day and in any season/weather. You can pick from a wide set of rods but always go with the one with a good luck boost. The best bait to use is Shark Head Bait, and this applies to every type of Orca.\n\n\nOnce you have got your setup on point, pray to get luck with the server event. Additionally, make sure that you're not fishing too far away from where the Orcas are. With some luck, you should be able to grab yourself a Secret Ancient Orca pretty soon.\n\n\nThe mini-update has also added the Oil Rig POI to the game, but it looks like part of bigger update in the future. You'll be able to meet a host of different NPCs at this location, including Dr. Glimmerfin, who might provide us with a new quest in the near future. \n\nThe post How to catch the Secret Ancient Orca in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
