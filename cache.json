We’ve seen plenty of sliding-tile puzzlers over the years, but Furniture & Mattress’ adventure is defined by its framing. It’s not an RPG, but it absolutely feels like one in many different ways. You have to use weapons to defeat certain monsters blocking your path. There’s a whole coming-of-age story about leaving home and growing up. There are even boss battles.\nIt’s as if puzzle designer Nico Recabarren (developer on Ethereal) built a completely new Rubix Cube, artist David Hellman (Braid) painted that Rubix Cube, and writer Nick Suttner (Carto) sketched out a world of fun and adventure around it, with everything taking place on a bunch of interconnected square grids. We’ve been enamoured since its reveal during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and going hands-on with the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we can’t wait to cause chaos by moving tiles around.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Just waiting on that call from Nintendo.\nIn a move that very few of us saw coming, PlayStation's Horizon series is heading to Nintendo Switch (albeit in the slightly more family-friendly, LEGO Horizon Adventures form). Is this a crossover episode? Are we witnessing the start of a bold new partnership between Sony and the Big N? Does this mean PlayStation IP will start leaking into the likes of Super Smash Bros.? We'd have to assume 'no' for that last one, but that's not to say that the devs of this latest LEGO adventure wouldn't be up for it.\nIn a new feature from Kotaku, Guerrilla Games' franchise development lead producer Tim Symons (who previously spent a decade at Nintendo of Europe as a Product Development Manager amongst other roles) was asked whether Horizon on Switch might lead to a Smash collaboration at some point down the line. While the dev hardly answered in the affirmative, he did confess that it would be \"nice\" to see. \"If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us,\" Symons told Kotaku, \"let me know\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It'd be understandable, then, if it was missed by plenty of gamers in a way that its sequel — on the current and dominant Nintendo system — was not.\nNow we have Monster Hunter Stories on Switch to right that wrong, and to ensure that Nintendo fans have both tales readily available. It's welcome, too; though these kid-friendly RPG outings for the series don't push the boundaries of the genre or even add much to the IP's impressive global reach, they are a pleasant introduction to a franchise that is traditionally rather challenging. This first entry comes with some enhancements, too, but it also feels unabashedly like the 3DS original, which isn't always a good thing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Boasting a full-length, alternate storyline and a host of gameplay and balance adjustments, SMTV: V is easily the definitive version of an already excellent entry in the long-running series. If you’re at all a fan of SMT, Persona, or JRPGs in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this up at the earliest opportunity.\nFor this review, we’ll be focusing more on the additions and adjustments being made to the core SMT V experience with this release—if you’d like to get a more detailed evaluation of the underlying gameplay mechanics and such, we’d encourage you to read through our review of the 2021 version, which still largely applies here, as well.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Mental Salvo describes itself as having an \"infinite open world\" in which you can do so many things, \"they're impossible to list\". Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a \"top down art adventure with light RPG elements\" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.\r\n \nRead more",

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.\n \nRead more",

Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them.

It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. \"It's also total chaos!\" I yell, as the elevator plummets. \"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.\nRead more",

South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence.

I reviewed State Of Decay the first and thought it was a cool scrappy underdog next to larger zombie-botherers such as Left 4 Dead or DayZ. State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.\nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.\n \nRead more",

Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.\r\n \nRead more",

Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fortnite patches often add new and exciting content for players to enjoy, but they've been known to take things away too. Following the June 13 update, fans are wondering if Party Royale has been removed, and we've got the answer. \n\n\nFortnite's 30.10 update definitely introduced a lot of stuff, from the massive Metallica collaboration, the Ride the Lightning Mythic item, and new modes to LEGO Fortnite. Epic definitely gives, but they also take away, and that has been the case with the latest patch. \n\n\nParty Royale was chill. Image via Epic Games\n\n\nDid Epic remove Party Royale?\n\n\nYes, Epic Games has removed Party Royale from Fortnite. The mode had been in the game since April 2020, but four years on, it is no more. As for why it's gone, unfortunately, we don't know that either. Epic didn't even announce that the mode was gone, and we had to jump on for ourselves to check. \n\n\nWorst of all, we don't know if this is Epic removing it with a plan to update and improve it, or if it's gone for good, never to be seen again. Epic says that anything they place in the vault always has a chance of returning, but just ask fans of the Among Us-esque Impostors mode how that's gone. \n\n\nParty Royale was a special place in Fortnite, ideal for those who found the battle royale mode a little too stressful. Here, players could hang out without the threat of elimination, watch movies or concerts by musical artists, and take part in fun mini-games with friends. The experimental space would change and evolve as seasons went by and had a dedicated fanbase who loved it. \n\n\nAll we can do now is hope that Epic has plans for its return. \n\nThe post Did Fortnite remove Party Royale?

While you may not necessarily craft the latter two, it’s an important thing to have because they are actually quite good, especially when min-maxing into the endgame activities.\n\n\nHow to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4\n\n\nThe best way to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4 is to farm Radiant and Resplendent Chests from public events all throughout the world and in Dungeons. Basically, any time you see an orange circle appear on your map or an upside-down triangle with three dots on each side, it indicates where an event is. \n\n\nOnce you get into the radius of the place, you’ll see “Event Joined” on your screen. Complete the event, preferably by meeting the requirements. Upon completing the event, the aforementioned chests should contain some units of Angel Breath. \n\n\nYou can also farm this resource when taking on the normal and Nightmare Dungeons. Since they also have events inside, you can earn a few units of Angel Breath while getting a first-time Aspect reward or farming Glyph XP for your Paragon board.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest way to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4\n\n\nSimilar to participating in events for Angel Breath, the best way to farm this resource is to partake in these during the Helltide. Everything spawns quicker here and there are more players active in these areas. \n\n\nBecause of that, you’re oftentimes going to run into events that are already in progress. So as you’re roaming around and collecting Aberrant Cinders to open the Helltide chests, you can easily snag a bunch of chest drops that will almost certainly contain Angel Breath.\n\n\nIf you happen to catch the tail end of an event, you may still reap a few rewards from the recently opened chests. They also tend to stack onto each other since they cycle so frequently.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Angel Breath farm: Best way to farm Angel Breath in Diablo 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Image via Epic Games\n\n\nThis will come as good news to many players, as sometimes getting a Mythic item can be a pain, especially if you need to defeat an NPC to get your hands on it. Thankfully, that's not the case here, and anyone can pick it up and use it. \n\n\nIn fact, in the few games I've played since the update was released, I've seen quite a few of them sitting around the island, so it doesn't look like they'll be that hard to find either. So get into the action, pick up a guitar, and zap up into the sky. \n\nThe post How to get the Ride the Lightning Mythic item in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whether you use Steam or not, anyone who's a gamer knows it's the biggest digital platform for PC. Valve's storefront has been a staple in the modern gaming world for two decades, but with that power, there comes a decent amount of backlash. This time it's from the UK.\n\n\nAccording to a recent report from the BBC, Steam is being sued, with accusations that the Valve Corporation is \"using its market dominance to overcharge 14 million people in the UK.\" The company is also being accused of \"rigging the market,\" which in turn is taking advantage of gamers.\n\n\nImage via Game Developer.\n\n\nThe antitrust lawsuit is being filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and was initiated by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt. The claim is also being backed by the Milberg London LLP law firm, with the report going on to say that Steam/Valve is being sued to the tune of £656m (around $839m, according to XE.com).\n\n\nWe've been here before\n\n\nAs noted by the BBC report, Shotbolt has been accusing the company of \"breaking UK competition law for at least six years.\" Indeed, this is not the first time the issue has come to the fore.\n\n\nThe fact that Steam takes a 30% commission has been a point of contention in the past. In 2022, a US judge ruled that Valve should face antitrust litigation for how it operates in the world of PC gaming. As well as the high commission, the company was also accused of \"imposing its own conditions on how even 'non-Steam-enabled games are sold and priced'.\"\n\n\nThis is just one of a number of complaints and cases that have been filed against the platform. While Steam is many people's go-to digital storefront, it's worth remembering that it's also a massive corporation that's not above the law.\n\nThe post Steam is being sued for ‘overcharging’ millions in the UK appeared first on Destructoid.",

While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn't an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …",

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. \nThe update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. \n\n\nTo start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. \nThis upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. \nAre you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!",

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. \nFor the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

          "description": "When your entire franchise revolves around sneaky assassins lurking in the shadows and running up buildings, it's no surprise fans of the series have been clamoring for a ninja-themed protagonist for years. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.\n\n\nIt opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…",

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. \nThe 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. \n\n\nIf you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. \n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.\nThe earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.",

          "description": "Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer id Software's modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. \nFret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. \nId Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. \nInterestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well. \nWhat do you think of Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal?
