Canadian solo developer Cheesemaster brings us this Japanese- and Korean-inspired afterlife sim. It’s a brew of Spirited Away, Stardew Valley, and other things that mostly goes down well, albeit with a few harder-to-swallow bits.\nYou create a character with limited customisation, and you’re told you’re a writer moving to a small town to focus on your book. As you settle in, you realise there are some odd occurrences that the locals can’t understand or explain. You’re given tea leaves which, when brewed in the teapot left by the previous resident, grant you ‘spirit vision’, the ability to see spirits invisible to the naked eye. Guided by Wonyan – a cat-like spirit guide who’s, well, catty – you’ll uncover some ghostly goings-on, and find the lost spirits causing them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.\nAs such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.\nRead more",

          "description": "Well, I think this is probably the first and only time I've ever heard British documentarian Adam Curtis appear as an ominous backing sample in an RPG boss battle theme, but in many ways, I hope it's not the last. Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. \nOnly this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.\nRead more",

I love how it looks, I love what it does, and I will endlessly admire how its little multi-coloured building bricks morph and shift, smooshed together in far more creative ways than I could ever manage myself. But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.\nBut then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again. \nRead more",

Which might not sound very appealing to BioWare diehards, but you can rest easy on one count: the game will have plenty of lore, though how it's served up to the player is another question.\nRead more",

Some of my personal favourites (the Gigabyte Aorus 15X! The Razer Blade 14! The Acer Nitro 5, if you’re on a budget!) have made into Black Friday’s early deal highlights, and there are plenty more besides. Most of them are rocking up-to-date Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, too, so they’ll be able to handle ray tracing and roid their own performance via DLSS 3.

Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes. Otherwise, this FPS simply isn't worth spending your hard-earned bucks on.\nRead more",

Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. \r\n\n\r\nAccording to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s all proven just too dangerous for Alan Wake 2 devs Remedy Entertainment, who’ve rebooted their upcoming F2P shooter Vanguard as a more traditional paid game. We later return to our core competences, in press release-speak, to talk about the Steam Deck OLED and the games we’ve been playing this week.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That megacorp's since upped sticks to, sadly, continue their terrible ways somewhere else in the solar system, but calling out these bad practices (beyond them being obviously bad and not good for the planet) is not really Loddlenaut's concern here. \nRather, your job is to simply clean up this mess with your array of high-tech gadgetry, healing its polluted environments so: a) it's not a grim, purple hellscape anymore; b) native, axolotl-like loddle creatures can move back in and prosper. It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard. But its straightforward, frictionless tale may leave some wishing it had just a little more bite, and less of a sense that you're laying the ground for some other faceless corpo power to go and splurge all over it again. \nRead more",

At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.\r\n\n\r\nYou can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games.

Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. \r\n\n\r\nYour energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Making a strategy game is \"harder than people give it credit for,\" Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it \"late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles,\" but it's also \"suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have,\" he says. \nEven now, \"it's got some catching up to do,\" he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that \"there's a thirst for something different now,\" both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. \"We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal.\"\nRead more",

It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. \r\n\nThe gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.\r\n\n\r\nThe reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase \"due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks\". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.\r\n\n\r\nI have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's \"just for kids\". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.\r\n \nRead more",

It has been almost a year since the release of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, meaning it's been now a full year of apologies, paused expansions, and transformative patches. And yet it lives.\r\n\nThe co-op shooter now seems on firmer ground, and to celebrate it's getting a two-part update called The Traitor Curse.

Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. \"They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. \r\n\n\r\n\"They had no shame!\" Aureus goes on. \"Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all.\"  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. \"So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.\nZelnick cautioned one investor against \"generalising\" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.\nHere's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.\nRead more",

          "description": "As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been \"demade\" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. \nCrow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?\nRead more",

There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Samsung's 980 Pro SSD may not be the company's PCIe 4.0 NVMe flagship any more, but it's still a fearsomely fast SSD in its own right that comes very close indeed to the 990 Pro in real-world performance tests. The 2TB model is currently discounted over at Amazon US, where you can find it for just $103 rather than its usual $128 - one of the best prices we've recorded for a 2TB drive of this speed and quality. \nRead more",

          "description": "To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?\r\n\n\r\nNot quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want \"more, more, more\" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.\nRead more",

          "description": "I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.\nValve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.\nRead more",

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And Valve has made sure nostalgia is set to hit you in the face like an unchecked crowbar right off the bat.

Next up for the game is a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in spring 2024. The team has been working on a big chunk of content that was originally planned for sometime in Q4 2023, but it's being pushed back to coincide with the console launch due to \"development and porting adjustments.\" \n\n\nThe update will launch on Steam around that time and will be available in the console versions along with all other previously-released updates. As for what the update entails, there are two new areas, over 300 new rooms, and a Boss Rush Mode. There's also a Maya Mode, which lets you play through as Maya for a taste of a new play style. Speedrun mode rules apply there, so just don't expect any new dialogue additions or endings. \n\n\nA short teaser was released along with the announcement to show off a tiny slice of new footage:\n\n\n\n\nThe footage may be brief, but it definitely sounds like there's a lot for players to look forward to when the update launches. \"As you can see, we have probably enjoyed making this update a little too much,\" the devs said in the announcement. The additional time will give them a chance to finalize code and QA test for consoles, so a little more patience should pay out nicely. \n\nThe post Twin-stick Metroidvania Rusted Moss confirms console plans, major content update appeared first on Destructoid.",

But for the recent release of Super Mario RPG, those asking “how long is it” may need a slightly more nuanced answer than usual.\n\n\nFor those just tuning in, the remake of the Super Nintendo classic Super Mario RPG is here. For my part, I absolutely loved reviewing the game. I do think there were missed opportunities with the remake. However, I remain confident in saying that everyone, in one way or another, should experience this adventure. It’s also a $60 remake of a 27-year-old game, and it doesn’t boast the longest run time.\n\n\nDepending on where you look, you'll maybe see the claim that Super Mario RPG takes 12 hours…",

          "description": "In the lead-up to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Square Enix has shared a recap of the original game’s story, set from the perspective of Red XIII. The recap comes as both Square Enix and fans are counting down the days until Rebirth's release on February 29, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe recap starts with a description of Midgar and the ShinRa Electric Power Company, set to a chilling rendition of Sephiroth’s theme. As Cloud, Barret and other members of Avalanche are introduced, the music starts to become more hopeful as Cloud meets Aerith following the Sector 8 reactor explosion. It quickly returns to the haunting choral melody as President Shinra and his employees are introduced.\n\n\nTo be honest, the recap does an excellent job of covering the basic plot points from Final Fantasy 7 Remake, though it does bypass the events of the Sector 6 slums, the Wall Market, Don Corneo’s Mansion, and everything else between meeting Aerith and the attack on Sector 7. It also doesn’t mention Zack’s inexplicable revival, which is interesting, given how important he seems to be in Rebirth.\n\n\nI must admit, though, seeing the fight against Sephiroth at the end of Remake again reminded me of how silly that final act was. Here’s hoping they’re able to make that fight and its ramifications make sense in Rebirth. It’s already been confirmed by Tetsuya Nomura that Rebirth will extend up to The Forgotten Capital, so things are already looking up in that regard. \n\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches exclusively for the PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.\n\nThe post Square Enix shares a Final Fantasy 7 Remake recap ahead of Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ever wondered what it's like to be a 29-year-old overworked Korean man who's never had a girlfriend? Boy, do I have the game for you!\n\n\nMotesolo: No Girlfriend Since Birth was developed by Indicava Interactive, and as the name suggests, it follows the story of a man named Kimo Kang who's about to turn 30 and wants to finally find a romantic partner. This is no easy feat, as he's awkward, nervous, and unintentionally idiosyncratic. It arrives on November 30 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid. \n\n\nUnique and full of heart\n\n\nMotesolo was originally released in 2021, and it won the Indie Game Award at the Korea Game Awards. It currently sits with a \"Very Positive\" rating on Steam, but you should be aware of what you're getting yourself into. \n\n\nIt is a movie game, meaning that the game plays out through live-action scenes. You do have some control, and the way the story pans out depends on your input. For instance, when you're in a cafe waiting for your blind date, you can interact with many things, and even gain some items or information that'll help you on your date. You'll also have to pick dialog options that hopefully lead to a happy ending. \n\n\nYou can also interact with Kimo's cellphone where you're able to chat with his friends and watch videos that could potentially help you find romantic success. The story isn't entirely about Kimo, however. You also get to learn about his blind date, Yumi, who is willing to give Kimo a chance, but she'll have to deal with his occasionally cringe-inducing behavior. \n\n\n\n\nIt's a funny, heartwarming game that is carried by the good performances and humorous plot. Give it a shot; you may be surprised at how good it is at putting a smile on your face. \n\nThe post Quirky movie game Motesolo: No Girlfriend Since Birth coming to consoles on November 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, a new set of players can experience the classic stealth title as heads to iOS and Android at the end of November as Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal.\n\n\nFeral Interactive, the same studio that brought us a slew of AAA titles to mobile, is back at it again. The developer dropped a trailer for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal that shows exactly what iOS and Android users should expect when the game releases on November 30.\n\n\n\n\nThe game's visuals remain on par with its PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 predecessors. But the stealth game's interface has been completely reworked to suit mobile devices. There have also been a few new bells and whistles included for a better overall experience.\n\n\nInstinct Mode is something that's being brought to Reprisal from later games in the series. It highlights targets and critical mission points to make navigating maps a bit easier. \n\n\nA mini-map is also being introduced to Blood Money for the first time. It offers better feedback on Agent 47's surroundings, including alerts if the character is raising suspicions. As in the original, there are 12 sandbox missions for players to enjoy over and over again due to their highly replayable nature.\n\n\nControls for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal have been reworked, too so that users can create a UI that fits them best on the go. However, those who wish to utilize a gamepad or keyboard and mouse have that option too. \n\n\nHitman: Blood Money - Reprisal sneaks up on iOS and Android users on November 30. It's listed in the App Store and Google Play Store for $14.99. A Nintendo Switch port is also planned for some point in the winter. \n\nThe post Hitman: Blood Money – Reprisal comes to iOS and Android this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Larian Studios announced Baldur’s Gate 3 will finally be receiving a physical release for PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2024. The physical release has been confirmed to be playable on-disc as a Deluxe Edition, which comes with a full, 3-disc soundtrack, a poster, and more.\n\n\nThe PlayStation 5 edition will contain 2 discs, while the Xbox Series X edition will contain 3 discs. PC, meanwhile, has a CD key and installer.\n\n\n\n\nIncluded in the Deluxe Edition for Baldur’s Gate 3 is the aforementioned poster of a mind flayer, a set of 32 stickers featuring iconography from the game’s story, the original soundtrack from the game, a world map, two patches — one of the Absolute logo and one of the Flaming Fist logo — and the game itself, on your chosen platform. You'll also get all Digital Deluxe edition content, too.\n\n\nIf you’ve been tracking the release status of Baldur’s Gate 3 since its digital PC launch in August and its digital PS5 release a month later, you might be surprised to read it’s only just now making the leap to a physical edition. \n\n\nUntil this announcement, the only way to get your hands on a physical copy of Baldur’s Gate 3 was in Japan. Spike Chunsoft, the developer of the Danganronpa series, was announced to be publishing the physical edition in Japan on December 21. But now, fans the world over can add the physical edition of this remarkable game to their libraries.\n\n\nPre-orders for the physical edition of Baldur’s Gate 3 are now open for all platforms. They are expected to ship in Q1 2024. \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 is getting a playable-on-disc physical Deluxe Edition appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As initially reported by IGN, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors commented during a financial presentation that he has no comment on the state of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. He also states, “Anything I say to this becomes a headline.” Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it will.\n\n\nA remake of the classic 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced back in 2021 during a Playstation Showcase. Since then, we’ve received re-releases of the two games in the series, and then everything kind of hit the rocks. The re-releases didn’t go very smoothly, and the intention of adding restored cut content to the second game (which badly needs it) was canceled. \n\n\nIn 2022, Bloomberg reported that the remake might have been put on hold. This was following the production of a demo – which reportedly didn’t go over very well – and the subsequent firing of the art and design director.\n\n\nWhile Wingefors statement doesn’t really say anything, the fact that it says nothing is pretty telling. If production was chugging along on schedule, he probably would have been quick to tout its promising outlook. It also doesn’t clarify if the project is on indefinite hold or canceled outright. So, that leaves us to speculate.\n\n\nI was pretty skeptical of the project, to begin with. Aspyr and Saber Interactive are capable studios, but they’re mostly known for porting existing games. A remake on this scale is pretty massive, so even if it saw the light of day, I’m not certain it would meet its ambition. Now, however, Embracer has been laying off massive amounts of people – reportedly 900 in a single financial quarter. I’m not saying it’s impossible for the Knights of the Old Republic remake to eventually see the light of day, but I’ll believe it when I see it.\n\nThe post Embracer boss gives no-comment comment on status of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch versions will be released at a later date.\n\n\nThe Kindeman Remedy is a warped game about a disgraced doctor and morally bankrupt nun performing experiments on prisoners in an attempt to create a breakthrough treatment. It’s a pretty violent take on the medical management genre, as you torture and poison the inmates as you seek to restore the doctor’s reputation at any cost. You’re able to upgrade your facilities and manage resources as you perform your macabre work.\n\n\n\n\nThe whole horror-management mash-up genre has been growing lately, following the success of Graveyard Keeper and Ravenous Devils. Perhaps there’s some crossover between people who enjoy management games and misanthropes. A category that I fit neatly into.\n\n\nI dig it. I would have liked to review this one if the season wasn’t so packed. Really, I’m waiting for someone to make something based on real-world serial killer H.H. Holmes and his Murder Castle. Only, hopefully, based less on reality because that whole tale is really screwed up. I just like the idea of the location also being the murder weapon.\n\n\nThe Kindeman Remedy is available today on PC via Steam.

However, there's a chance that Team Green may be halting production of two of its products.\n\n\nThat's according to a post on Board Channels (as spotted by Videocardz), which states that Nvidia has allegedly \"discontinued\" the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080. The information goes on to say that the \"last distribution of goods in the 2023Q4 quarter has ended.\"\n\n\nImage via Videocardz (source: Board Channels)\n\n\nWhile the rumor has not been confirmed, one reason behind this could be so Nvidia can concentrate on newer models in the 4000 range. This could be in relation to the alleged RTX 4080 SUPER as well as a potential 4070 Ti SUPER.\n\n\nSomething could be lost in translation\n\n\nAs the report from Videocardz notes, there's no real way to verify whether this information is 100% accurate or not. There may be some miscommunication going on here. It's possible that what's being said is referring to a temporary hold on mass production of the RTX cards, as opposed to fully discontinuing the SKUs.\n\n\nAs always with these things, it's best to temper any immediate judgements you may have. Nvidia will hopefully come forward with official word on what's true and what isn't.\n\n\nThis current generation of graphics cards is only a year old (or just over) so it probably wouldn't make sense for a tech firm to completely discontinue products. More stock may be put into some SUPER variants, but it doesn't seem likely that Nvidia would cease production of two of its graphics cards at this point.\n\nThe post Nvidia reportedly stops mass production of two RTX 4000 cards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Announcements of layoffs from some of the biggest names around have been dominating news sections lately. While we already knew Embracer Group was one of them, we now know the figures.\n\n\nIn the most recent sales report from the Crystal Dynamics and Gearbox Software owner, the company has said it experienced a 13% increase in net sales between July and September of this year (Q2 of their 2023-2024 fiscal year).\n\n\n\n\nIt then goes on to acknowledge that \"around 900\" people were part of the \"reduction in headcount.\" This equates to 5% of the whole workforce. That's quite an astonishing amount of people to let go. Embracer Group said it's also \"reduced the number of projects\" being worked on and is focussing on \"improving the projected return on investment within PC/Console.\"\n\n\nAt least the company is doing well...\n\n\nThe report goes on to say that CEO Lars Wingeford would like to \"put on record a special thanks to the people who have left Embracer in the quarter.\" Unfortunately, it's unlikely to bring much comfort to those who have lost their jobs.\n\n\nWe already knew that developers under Embracer's umbrella were being targeted for mass layoffs. However, this latest report really hammers home the extent to which studios have been affected by these \"reductions.\"\n\n\nYou've heard this story dozens of times already. Ubisoft, Team17, Naughty Dog, Amazon, CD Projekt Red, and many more have all been involved in redundancies, many to the tune of hundreds. One wonders whether anyone would still be interested in seeking a career in game development after all this.\n\nThe post The monolith that is Embracer Group confirms 900 layoffs in just one quarter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sonic has been enjoying renewed popularity in recent years thanks to the two Sonic the Hedgehog movies that have become some of the highest-grossing video game adaptations. Sega hopes to capitalize on this by bringing more of its franchises to a non-gaming audience. \n\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Sega's chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi revealed that the platforms they are considering include movies and even Roblox. The second Sonic movie grossed an impressive $405.4 million, so it's no surprise that they hope to replicate this success with its other IPs. \n\n\nIPs that are being considered include Like a Dragon (previously known as Yakuza). An adaption could be a hit, as it already has a huge following. As Sega reveals, the franchise has sold 21.1 million units.\n\n\nPersona may also find itself on more platforms. It's easy to imagine it being adapted to a film series or even a television series, as the franchise already features gripping narratives and plenty of relationships and friendships to explore. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nSega denies acquisition rumors\n\n\nThere have been rumors that Microsoft is keen to purchase Sega, but Utsumi denies this. He explains that several companies are interested in acquiring Sega, and though it is an honor, he doesn't believe that \"kind of transaction is going to happen.\"\n\n\nThis doesn't mean that Sega isn't planning to make some acquisitions for itself. Utsumi claims the company is still looking for growth during a time when Japanese studios are doing well while \"European studios are struggling\" following the post-COVID-19 sales decline. \n\n\nWe've seen some of the effects of this through the seemingly endless waves of layoffs that have struck the industry. Utsumi remains optimistic, and he believes that the future is bright so long as \"you have solid development studios and also solid IPs.\" \n\nThe post After the success of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, Sega wants to bring more of its IPs to other platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

Disappointingly, New Game+ wasn't present at launch, though Ubisoft will fix that soon.\n\n\nThe New Game+ mode update will hit AC: Mirage in December. It's free for all players, and it'll also include a permadeath mode to test the best assassins. We don't know what else the update will bring, but Ubisoft promises that more details will follow soon. \n\n\n\n\nMirage follows Basim as he goes from a petty thief and pickpocketer to a deadly assassin. It is set in Baghdad, and the region is filled to the brim with gorgeous sights and well-hidden collectibles. For players who want to experience the ancient city again but don't want to lose all their upgrades, the update will be a godsend. \n\n\nThe trend of games not launching with a New Game+ mode is an increasingly annoying and increasingly common problem. Fortunately, it wasn't enough to completely ruin Mirage, and upon launching, it received relatively good reviews from critics who appreciated the more streamlined approach it takes. \n\n\nThings are quite busy in the Assassin's Creed world, as AC: Nexus VR launches on November 16 on the Meta Quest 2 and 3.

          "description": "The Thaumaturge has been delayed from its original December 5 release date to February 20, 2024, announced publisher 11 Bit Studios and developer Fool’s Theory. The delay is to give the game “some additional time in development,” according to a press release sent to Destructoid.\n\n\n“As the finishing touches were put on the game over recent weeks, the team saw the opportunity to add more polish and quality, and given they have the comfort to allow themselves some extra time the decision was made to delay,” the press release said.\n\n\n\n\nIt’d seem the delay is mostly applicable to the PC version of The Thaumaturge, though it is said that the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be coming “at a later date.”\n\n\nFor those out of the loop, The Thaumaturge follows — you guessed it — a thaumaturge named Wiktor Szulski, who is sent on a quest to cope with the metaphorical skeletons in his past. \n\n\n“Unfolding in 1905 Warsaw, the story revolves around the complex theme of inner demons and how in this world that can mean more than just a mental burden,” according to the press release.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that aside from The Thaumaturge, Fool’s Theory is also concurrently working on the upcoming remake of CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher. The remake was announced in October 2022, and is being “rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5,” according to the announcement. Fool’s Theory also assisted Larian Studios with “gameplay and tools programming support” on the recently released Baldur’s Gate 3.\n\nThe post The Thaumaturge has been delayed to February 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get ready for another rollercoaster of emotions, because the next full romance visual novel from Clannad and Kanon developer Key has been announced. \n\n\nThe studio's new game is titled anemoi (via Gematsu) and so far we know some of the main staff members behind it. Kai is directing and writing the scenario, with Yuu Nijima, Hasama, and Shun Sayuki joining in on writing duties. Kai has worked on a bunch of Key projects, including scenario writing for Clannad, Air, and Kud Wafter, among others. Shinji Orito is the music producer, while Na-Ga, Humuyun, Yuunon Nagayama, and Ao Kimishima are handling key animation. \n\n\nMany of the details for anemoi have yet to be divulged, including release date and platforms. We'll know more soon, though, because an announcement stream is set to go live on November 17 starting at 7:00 p.m. Japan Time. While we wait, you can check out a brief teaser below.\n\n\n\n\nThe key to your heart\n\n\nKey has been working in the visual novel space since 1999, and has released titles both with and without adult content. The studio's first two works, Kanon and Air, both originally launched as adult games, while games like Clannad aimed for a wider audience from the outset. Many of their works also made the leap to anime and manga adaptations over the years. Since the teaser video doesn't offer much outside of a lightly animated visual, we'll have to wait and see what kind of notes anemoi plans to hit. \n\nThe post Clannad studio Key reveals anemoi as next romance visual novel appeared first on Destructoid.",

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

He also features the original throwback soundtrack and sound effects. You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone.

          "description": "Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. \nWoo!

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.\nBandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip. \nWatch Us Tour Japan's Gundam Factory:",

We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:\nIn Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. \nNancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however).

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
