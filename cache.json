This model, which is allegedly based on the real thing and appears very much in line with what every other leak has suggested, has given us our best look yet at what 'Switch 2' might be (remember, Nintendo is still yet to officially reveal anything).

          "description": "Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that \"evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world\", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.\r\n \nRead more",

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.\nRead more",

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow.

Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft.

For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

          "description": "Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.\nThe newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as \"Ghost Of A Tail\" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.\nAnyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year.

One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "\"We are a people who honour democracy,\" said the dog, scratching himself. \"Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water.\" The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.\nA cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.\nRead more",

          "description": "Marvel Rivals is rapidly becoming one of the most popular multiplayer video games running right now, and it's just reached a massive milestone on Steam. For a few hours, Marvel Rivals was the most-played game on Steam, outperforming some top-tier competitors and proving its staying power within the multiplayer scene.\n\n\nMarvel Rivals' Season 1 launch turned it into the most-played game on Steam\n\n\nImage via NetEase Games\n\n\nWhen Marvel Rivals launched in December last year, it instantly became one of the most popular games on Steam. The game amassed over 2,000,000 players on Steam within hours of its release, shattering expectations. However, some people remained unconvinced the game's time in the spotlight would last long. Some onlookers, including former Blizzard head Mike Ybarra, downplayed the game's success, predicting its post-launch hype would fizzle out fast. \n\n\nLuckily for fans, Marvel Rivals' harshest critics got a huge reality check when Season 1 dropped on January 10, 2025. According to SteamDB, Marvel Rivals racked up 644,269 concurrent players in the hours after Season 1 went live, breaking its previous all-time peak player count and sending it flying to the top of Steam's most-played game chart.\n\n\nWhile Marvel Rivals would lose its spot at the top of the pyramid within a few hours, it's impossible to deny how impressive that accomplishment is. In the short time it was the most-played game on Steam, Marvel Rivals outperformed some stiff competition. This included Path of Exile 2, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2, all of which have become mainstays on Steam's most-played lists.\n\n\nWith Season 1 in full swing, the odds of Marvel Rivals' player count getting swelled by word-of-mouth are pretty high. If that happens, the little hero shooter that could might end up topping Steam's most-played list soon.\n\nThe post Marvel Rivals was briefly the most played game on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

But that's not all, as you can add five new species to your collection.\n\n\nAll Fisch Golden Tide Bestiary species\n\n\nLet's first take a look at the five new species that are part of Bestiary.\n\n\nSpecies\nType\nPreferred Bait\n\n\n\n\nTidal Pike\nLimited\nNight Shrimp\n\n\nConfetti Shark\nLimited\nDeep Coral\n\n\nEternal Frostwhale\nLimited\nShark Head\n\n\nHourglass Bass \nLimited\nAurora Bait\n\n\nCountdown Perch\nLimited\nWeird Algae\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can catch all five species any time of the day, which makes it relatively easy as far as the day/night cycle is concerned. But they will only spawn in the Golden Tide Pool and won't be available anywhere else.\n\n\nGolden Tide Pool location in Fisch\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Golden Tide Pool doesn't have a fixed location and spawns randomly. However, you can watch out for a few clues to find it after the pool spawns on your server. First, there will be a server-wide notification, which will state that the Golden Tide Pool has started.\n\n\nWhile the exact location won't be announced, you can find it by tracking a bright orange marker. Just travel to the marker, and you'll be able to catch all five limited species.\n\n\nIf you haven't figured out by their limited nature already, these species won't be spawning indefinitely. They are likely going to be available until January 18th, when the next update is expected to drop. Make sure to complete the Mr. Glimmerfin quest as well if you're looking for a new ride and rod in Fisch.\n\nThe post How to complete Golden Tide Bestiary in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're someone looking to expand your roster in Anime Reborn, Aizen (Aizon) can be a worthy shot.\n\n\nThe character by itself is pretty strong, but you can improve its potential with the help of evolutions. To evolve him, you'll need something called Spiritual Cores. Before that, let's find out how you can obtain him inside the game.\n\n\nHow to get Aizen (Aizon) in Anime Reborn\n\n\nAizon (as Aizen is called in the game) can be obtained from the New Year's Crates, but you'll have to hope to get really lucky. The odds of getting him is a mere 0.25%, as he is a Secret Unit. In fact, the total odds of obtaining a Secret Unit from the chest is only 0.5%.\n\n\nYou can open the chests at the World Collision Adventure. Just talk with Cid NPC by using the Event button. To open the chests, you'll need 250 New Year Coins, which in turn can be earned by completing the Bingo quests. You can get additional New Year Coins by using codes and finishing the World Collision event stage.\n\n\n\n\nHow to evolve Aizen (Aizon) in Anime Reborn\n\n\nAs good as Aizon is in his base version, you'll want to evolve him as soon as possible. This can be done with the help of a Spiritual Core, which can also be obtained from the World Collision Adventure Stage. There's a 5% chance for it to drop once you complete the stage. Naturally, it could take you several tries before you can find a Spiritual Core.\n\n\nEven if you aren't lucky with your drops, you can end up finding the new exclusive Cid. You can also get the material required to evolve Cid. Bottom line: make sure to keep trying your luck because Aizon is definitely worth the evolution. At worst, you'll still find a lot of valuable resources that will help to power up other characters from your collection. \n\nThe post How to obtain and evolve Aizen in Anime Reborn appeared first on Destructoid.",

It has been released earlier in 2023, but if you're new, now is your chance.\n\n\nLet's take a look at how to complete the Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt in Forza Horizon 5.\n\n\nForza Horizon 5 Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt guide\n\n\nTo begin the Treasure Hunt, you will have to start by checking out the clue.\n\n\n\n‘Hypercars turn up the charm by five as they narrowly avoid others on the highway’\n\n\n\n\nThis clue is followed by a picture of a 2020 Koenigsegg Jesko, but you don't need this particular Hypercar to complete your task. In fact, you can use any Hypercar available in your garage to complete the Treasure Hunt.\n\n\nStart driving along the main freeway (located right at the center of the map). You'll have to achieve five \"Near Miss\" skills. This is pretty easy to do: just drive close to the oncoming vehicles, but make sure that your car doesn't make contact.\n\n\nImage via Playground Games\n\n\nOnce you complete this objective, you'll be notified that you've solved the clue. The Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt is located near Guanajuato, and you'll have to travel to the location. You'll find the chest at the base of a monument found at this location. Just drive through it, and you'll complete the Charmed I'm Sure Treasure Hunt.\n\n\nAdditionally, completing the objective will also get you 3 points that will contribute towards the Festival Playlist completion and 300 Forzathon Points. The points can be spent in the Forzathon shop.\n\nThe post How to complete the Charmed I’m Sure Treasure Hunt in Forza Horizon 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
