Yes, if you hadn't guessed by now, the language has been translated.\nThis was no easy feat. The 'Dolphic' language (as dubbed by 2CPhoenix) is pretty hard to come by across Isle Delfino.

          "description": "Twas brillig, and the RPS editors did gyre and gimble in the wabe: all mimsy were the studio executives, and the guides writers outgrabe. If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced \"gaslamp fantasy\" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.\nLast week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go.\" And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. \nThe biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.  \nRead more",

          "description": "\"Banishers took a while to kick in,\" I wrote in the RPS group chat last week, \"but I fought a monster made of angry witch-hunting jam last night.\" It was a pivotal boss fight about half way through Don't Nod's ghost hunting action-adventure RPG Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden, and typical of the over-the-top, slightly ridiculous, but entirely earnest drama of the game that joyfully pulls you along. Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for \"grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series\" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.\nBanishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace \"treasure\" with \"ghosts\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. \"Procgen\" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a \"hand-made\" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. \r\n\n\r\nOne is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of \"Fae\" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principle quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. \nBut one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is \"probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that.\" Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape.

          "description": "When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.\nSome games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of \"living, breathing\" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, \"gardenvania\" - which launches next week.\n Read more",

On the one hand, there's arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you're going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own \"repercussions\", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration. \nRead more",

          "description": "Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from \"literally about 3 ever made\" to \"does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter\". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense \"survive the ordeal\" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.\nBut it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment.

I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.\nBut I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, \"water\" and \"fire\" combine to make \"steam\", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable.

The Legion Go debuted at £699, a price at which we found it largely compelling, but now it's dropped to something a bit more reasonable - £649. \nThat £50 discount doesn't make it a budget option by any means, especially with the most affordable Steam Deck at £349 and an OLED model at £479, but it's still a welcome price drop on one of the most intriguing PC handhelds we've seen yet. \nRead more",

You play as Ting, a pre-adolescent girl living in Malaysia with her parents. Ting discovers her supernatural ability to see ghosts at a camp, where she meets Xiu, a ghost girl about her own age.

I just think they're neat.

Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.\nHarold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.\nRead more",

          "description": "Action-RPG colossus Elden Ring is reportedly getting a free-to-play mobile adaptation with in-app purchases, which takes inspiration from miHoYo's Genshin Impact. It's being published by Tencent, who apparently acquired the licensing rights to Elden Ring back in 2022 and put a few dozen people to work on a prototype, even as the company acquired a 16% stake in Elden Ring developer From Software.\nAll that's according to Reuters, who cite three sources \"familiar with the matter\". I realise that \"free-to-play mobile version of Elden Ring with in-app purchases\" is a phrase tailormade to give certain players hives and/or cause the speaker to be struck by lightning, but much as I can't help looking over cliff edges, I do find the idea fascinating.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "Blíží se další pravidelné setkání bastlířů, techniků a ajťáků - Virtuální Bastlírna. Na jaké novinky a témata k diskuzi se můžete těšit tentokrát? Do světa HW přinesla firma JLCPCB levnou výrobu plně barevných plošných spojů (takže vám už nic nebude bránit natisknout na všechny plošňáky svou podobiznu). Na trhu se už také běžně pohybují analogová FPGA, o kterých na Virtuální Bastlírně padla zmínka už před rokem. Zároveň na Printables.com probíhala soutěž v tvorbě roztodivných přípravků na pájení, na jejíž výsledky kluci na Virtuální Bastlírně upozorní. A pokud by náhodou padla nostalgická nálada, mohou ukázat jak se dělá overclocking počítače Ondra a nebo jak vypadal asi nejschopnější československý počítač okopírovaný ze západu.\r\n \r\nVe virtuální světě software pak strahováci poví jenom něco málo o smutném vývoji PlatformIO, ukáží jak se dá zaútočit na digitální momentové klíče Bosch (a lze tak vyřadit z provozu třeba celou fabriku) a nebo jak KiCAD dohání svého průmyslového souputníka Altium (spoiler alert - přidali splashscreen).\r\n\r\nPokud se zdá, že tento měsíc nejsou témata příliš lákavá, nebojte - kluci zmíní určitě i oblíbenou rubriku \"Bizár\". Například proč smart jistič ovládaný přes wifi není příliš dobrý nápad nebo jak se v Brně zapojuje plynové potrubí. A kdyby to nestačilo, v zásobě je i emulátor procesoru v Excelu.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 12. února od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "While there have been efforts by AMD over the years to make it easier to port codebases targeting NVIDIA's CUDA API to run atop HIP/ROCm, it still requires work on the part of developers. The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn't any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it's a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this \"skunkworks\" project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.",

Head of Xbox Phil Spencer, President of Xbox Sarah Bond, and Head of Xbox Gaming Matt Booty are coming together on the official Xbox Podcast at 3 p.m. EST on February 15 to share updates on the Xbox business.\n\n\n\n\n Does anyone else think it's weird this information is coming in podcast format?\n\n\nNo further details were provided, but you have to imagine the focus will be on reports and rumors that Xbox is planning to bring some of its exclusive titles to PlayStation. The rumors have shown just how divisive gamers can be, with some praising the end of the \"console wars\" with the hope of games being available on all platforms, while doomsayers claim this is the end of Xbox.\n\n\nMe? I think the truth is probably somewhere in between. I highly doubt we'll see every Xbox IP come to PlayStation. I wouldn't expect haptic feedback when firing a Needler from Halo on PS5 or anything like that. But at the end of the day Xbox, and Microsoft, are all about that money. For games like Starfield, choosing to be Xbox exclusive essentially means leaving money on the table, especially when over 50 million PS5 units have been sold.\n\n\nI guess we'll know for sure when Xbox shares its plans on February 15 at 3 p.m. EST. It will be streamed on YouTube and available via Podcast platforms.\n\nThe post Xbox business update coming via Xbox podcast on Thursday appeared first on Destructoid.",

Did you know that the Forza community maintains a humongous list of real-world car paint specifications?\n\n\nIndeed, there's a small, but extremely dedicated community of Forza players that's spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours meticulously recreating real-world car paint swatches for virtual use. It's widely accepted that Gran Turismo generally offers a more pleasing and accurate car paint shader, and the fact of the matter is that some of the default manufacturer paints simply don't match up to their real-world inspiration.

I played the demo but didn’t have time to take on the full release. It’s based on that very distinct N64 flavor of collectathon platformer that immediately turned on itself and died from self-deprecation. To sell the illusion, it also cops a low poly art style with blurry textures and odd lighting choices similar to the N64’s best.\n\n\nI loved the demo that I played. You’re put in the role of a diminutive dragon who sets out across a variety of worlds to rescue his siblings, who are still within eggs. Where I’ve been disappointed by some other games in the indie sphere’s revival of the 3D platformer, Cavern of Dreams feels like a close facsimile of what made the genre charming.\n\n\n\n\nAlongside the announcement of the Switch version, Super Rare Originals released an accolades trailer, so you can see brief, out-of-context quotes by others in the gaming press.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t see any mention of whether or not it will be compatible with the Nintendo Switch Online N64 controller.\n\n\nCavern of Dreams is currently available on PC.

I deliver nothing but disappointment.\n\n\n\n\nThe Earth Defense Force series started back on the PS2 with Simple 2000 Series Vol. 31: The Chikyū Bōeigun, which was released in Europe as Monster Attack. We didn’t receive the series here in North America until 2006 with Earth Defense Force 2017 on Xbox 360. It was released as a budget game and quickly developed a reputation of being so bad that it’s good. Indeed, a friend and I played it during the early days of the 360, and we loved it despite its immediately apparent jank. I still like to tell the story of how the light bloom from one of the guns would bleed over the split-screen barrier and make it impossible for the other player to see.\n\n\nThe series continued from there, with Sandlot embracing the game’s kusoge aesthetic while also making it a bit more fun and comfortable to play. I wish I was playing Earth Defense Force 5 right now.\n\n\nEarth Defense Force 6 sees the dregs of humanity protecting their shattered civilization from continued attacks from “invasive” alien species. Thankfully, the eponymous EDF has 1-4 competent soldiers to protect it.\n\n\nEarth Defense Force 6 will be coming West sometime in Summer 2024. It’s set to release on PS4, PS5, and PC.\n\nThe post Earth Defense Force 6 delays bug smashing until Summer 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Let's play a game. Let's see how long I can talk about No Man's Sky without bringing up its redemptive arc (this doesn't count, by the way). \n\n\nThe universe-exploration game with the chill soundtrack has certainly found its home among sci-fi enthusiasts, and the developer's co-founder is, once again, up to his old tricks. Sean Murray recently tweeted something that has No Man's Sky fans pretty hyped up. What is it? Oh, it's just an Omega symbol he posted on Twitter/X. Why is that a big deal? Because Murray always tweets a singular tease like this whenever a big update is due to drop.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, he's posted it more than once, including three consecutive Omega symbols in one tweet. This is not a drill, people!\n\n\n\"So what is it?\" - obscure Red Dwarf reference\n\n\nThis is absolutely typical of Murray. As usual, these teases leave no clue (apart from the tease itself) as to what's coming. It's become part of the No Man's Sky marketing model and, honestly, looking at the comments and the recent posts on Reddit, it absolutely works.\n\n\nSpeculations have been inbound since the emoji post, with one person suggesting that it's some sort of fabled Horseshoe Update. We can't rule it out, though I think even Hello Games might draw the line there.\n\n\nReleased in 2016, No Man's Sky has been something of a unique entry in modern gaming. Encapsulating a galactic playground boasting more than 18 quintillion planets to discover, its initial and disastrous launch has become a distant memory. Vast (and free) updates have exceeded expectations, bringing us a game that's gone down as one of the best examples of a redemptive arc ever.\n\n\n(Damn it!)\n\nThe post No Man’s Sky update hype begins anew as Sean Murray tweets single emoji appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the fact that it's knocked the Steam Deck off the spot is pretty interesting.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Deck itself typically remains steadfast, dominating the chart and keeping even the most hyped-up releases at bay.

Given this, it probably won't be long before Valve's mobile gaming device reclaims its place.\n\n\nThat said, it says much about Helldivers 2's quick rise to fame and how well it's been performing over the weekend. It has a Steam review score of \"Mostly Positive,\" which is pretty good, though some issues with crashing are probably holding it back slightly.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, the game has over 101,000 concurrent players, according to the most recent data from SteamDB. It also achieved a peak of 155,926 players recently. While this pales in comparison to Palworld (sorry to keep pitting the two against each other!), Arrowhead's new release can at least enjoy the ride while it lasts.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2 overtakes Steam Deck to become Steam’s currently top-selling game appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest in a near-endless attempt to get id Software's iconic FPS up and running on just about everything on the planet is one that will be music to your ears. Or not, as is the case.\n\n\nOver on Reddit, user wojtek-graj has made Doom completely playable...in audio. That is to say, they've managed to get it to run in a spectrogram, which is a visual representation of sound frequencies. Actually, I'll let them give you the lowdown:\n\n\n\nThe game is displayed by generating an audio signal that can be viewed as a spectrogram, while input is taken from the microphone, with specific frequencies being mapped to specific keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've also made the source code available on GitHub, as well as instructions on how to play it. So if you find playing the classic way a bit too passé, this is at least one alternative.\n\n\nIt will never end\n\n\nThere simply isn't time in the known universe to go through all the different devices that can now run a 30-year-old shooter. Suffice it to say, it's brought out a lot of creativity in people over the years. Here, someone has been wanting to get Doom to run on E. coli cells.\n\n\nWith the reboot coming out in 2016 and Eternal launching in 2020, the legendary id series has truly made a comeback. \n\n\nNot that it ever really went anywhere. Sure, things looked a little uncertain with Doom 3's approach to more survival horror, but seeing the OG running on a spectrogram means – if nothing else – fans sure aren't bored with Doom yet.\n\nThe post Doom is now playable on an audio spectrogram, because why not? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will occur on February 15 at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. \n\n\n\"I myself am very surprised,\" said Shimomura on Twitter (through a translation provided by the platform). \"I'm very honored.\" She also mentioned this is \"possible thanks to [our] support.\" \n\n\nImage via Disney and Square Enix\n\n\nWho is Kingdom Hearts composer Yoko Shimomura?\n\n\nYoko Shimomura is a game composer known for her decades of work in the industry. She's behind the scores of Street Fighter 2, the Kingdom Hearts series, Super Mario RPG (with a re-orchestrated soundtrack for the remake), Final Fantasy XV, and the Parasite Eve franchise. Her vivid and illustrious music has now been recognized by her peers in the industry.\n\n\n\"Dearly Beloved,\" the main menu theme from Kingdom Hearts, is arguably her most notable song. What impresses many is that each game has its own take on the original piano-led track. For example, there's a swing version of the track in the rhythm game Melody of Memory. \n\n\n\n\n“I was playing the beginning of the game, set in the Destiny Islands, and I was struck by a lot of imagery about the sea,\" said Yoko Shimomura to Square Enix. \"Dearly Beloved just came to my mind one day, while I was thinking about that - picturing the sea and the waves.”\n\n\nStreamed through IGN, the D.I.C.E. Awards will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Greg Miller and IGN's Stella Chung. The finalists for Game of the Year include Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cocoon, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. \n\nThe post Kingdom Hearts composer Yoko Shimomura receives Lifetime Achievement award from DICE appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo has dropped the VOD for The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert onto their YouTube after canceling the originally Tokyo-exclusive performance at Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the tracks performed include Kakariko Village, The Ballad of the Goddess, and the main theme of Tears of the Kingdom. The orchestra beautifully showcases the series' rich musical history through powerful renditions of the beloved classics. At a runtime of almost a half hour, it'll make for a pretty nice trip down memory lane if you're up for that adventure. \n\n\nAlso posted were statues of the Tears of the Kingdom's versions of Zelda, Link, and our no.1 hottie (according to Zoey Handley), Ganondorf. \n\n\n\n\nThe concert was originally planned for Nintendo Live TOKYO in January. Nintendo canceled the event after receiving threats targeting the audience and workers. \n\n\nIn addition to the Zelda concert, Nintendo also held a Splatoon 3-themed concert the morning of February 10. \n\n\nMusically Inclined\n\n\nWhether you like The Legend of Zelda or not, you have to agree the music is amazing. Whether it's the classic Koji Kondo tracks or the newer Manaka Kataoka compositions, all Zelda music is downright memorable. So, to be able to have a whole concert dedicated to it and done live is pretty awesome. \n\n\nWatching the concert made me realize something: I really want to see it live. The closest I got to that was Lindsey Stirling with her Zelda melody years ago. And, as someone who's watched the trailers for Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wind multiple times for the songs, I'd pay good money. I feel the same way about Final Fantasy and Sonic, as all of them have amazing orchestral tracks that'd be amazing to see live. So, Nintendo, maybe you could plan a national tour or something? Fine, I'll just play my ocarina in private.\n\nThe post The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert VOD is now available appeared first on Destructoid.",

Other reception I’ve seen has been lukewarm, but I’m serious. I’ve tried multiple times to get into other football titles like NFL Blitz, but I felt doomed to forever hate the sport. I mean American football, not real football. I suppose the secret sauce to get me interested is to just somehow make it more violent.\n\n\nMutant Football League has you choose a team made up of skeletons, werewolves, and robots and kick the pigskin or something. Beyond just being American football with furries, cheating is encouraged, and violence is an inevitability. The inclusion of dirty tricks just adds an extra layer of fun strategy. Murder is a legitimate strategy, allowing you to focus on eliminating your opponent's best players.\n\n\nThe Early Access release will start with just 12 teams and arenas out of the planned 48. It will be offline only at first, and the team is giving the heads up that it will initially be reusing the audio assets from the first game but will be updated with its own music and VO over time. They’re hoping that the full version will be ready in Fall 2024.\n\n\nThe team has had some difficulty in developing Mutant Football League 2, as many of the developer’s staff are located in Ukraine, which is currently under invasion by Russia.\n\n\nMutant Football League 2 is set to release on Steam Early Access on PC in March\n\nThe post Mutant Football League 2 kicks off into Early Access this March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Had your eye on that Destiny 2 Exotic weapon ornament or emote but find yourself Bright Dust poor? There is no need to despair or mindlessly grind out Bounties. Bungie announced it will start giving away Bright Dust for free every week beginning in March. \n\n\nThe gifting is set to go on until the launch of The Final Shape expansion in June. And at 700 Bright Dust per weekly reset, it's certainly no small amount to gloss over.\n\n\nBright Dust is one of the premium currencies found within Destiny 2. While players can earn it in-game through various means, it's usually nothing too substantial. Bright Dust is used alongside Silver for purchases through the Eververse Store. It's primarily a shop for cosmetic items like shaders, weapon ornaments, vehicles, or exclusive armor appearances. Though much of the Eververse Store demands Silver, every week, various goodies are sold for Bright Dust instead.\n\n\nBungie dropped this unexpected and generous news in Destiny 2's latest This Week In Destiny communication. In a short section titled \"The Future Is Bright,\" Bungie explained, \"As we head toward The Final Shape, we're honoring Guardians with a new weekly gift of Bright Dust. Starting on March 5, players can visit the Eververse store to claim 700 Bright Dust each week leading up to the launch of The Final Shape. Make sure to log in, get your Dust, and spend wisely, Guardians.\"\n\n\nBright Dust transactions have historically been absent for some of the hottest Destiny 2 cosmetics, like the Witcher crossover armor. That said, plenty of spend-worthy choices are available each week, especially if players have missed past seasons or holiday events. With (by my count) 9100 extra Bright Dust, do yourself a favor and treat yourself.\n\nThe post Bungie will give Destiny 2 players free weekly Bright Dust starting in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a trend that's often met with negative response, but it turns out this is probably not the case for the upcoming game.\n\n\nAccording to a recent update on Unknown World's website – the developer behind the Subnautica series – there are no plans to implement GaaS for the next installment. This is almost certainly a response to what publisher Krafton said in a recent earnings call.\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while writing the original draft of this story, it looks like Krafton may have changed what it originally said.

          "description": "It's a dismal time to be in video game development, as companies continue to announce layoffs. Now, Take-Two Interactive – the parent company of Rockstar – is looking to enact a \"significant cost reduction plan,\" but it doesn't necessarily mean redundancies.\n\n\nThat's according to CEO and chairman Strauss Zelnick, who told IGN recently that there are \"no current plans\" to lay staff off. The specifics of this plan are said to still being worked out, but Zelnick says there are other areas that need looking at, such as marketing, third-party expenses, supply services, etc.\n\n\n\n\nHe also adds that the \"hardest thing to do is to lay off colleagues,\" though that phrasing sort of suggests one would do it if it was easier. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.\n\n\nI'm a cynic, what can I say?\n\n\nIt's difficult to talk about Take-Two without mentioning GTA 6. Last year's reveal trailer has been viewed a squillion times, making it one of the most-viewed video game teasers in existence. If the parent company does eventually decide it needs to initiate layoffs, there's no telling whether this would potentially affect the next Grand Theft Auto game.\n\n\nAgain, this is just a complete guess from me. While there aren't any \"current\" plans for layoffs, that doesn't necessarily mean things won't change in the future, near or far.\n\n\nJust recently, Take-Two was also in the headlines, facing a class-action lawsuit regarding microtransactions in NBA games. Hard to find two topics that get people more riled up than layoffs and microtransactions.\n\nThe post GTA parent Take-Two has ‘no current plans’ for layoffs, CEO says appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Larian, improvements have been made to smooching in the cRPG, as can be seen in the brief video clip they provided. In this teaser, Halsin follows up a passionate kiss with a peck on the forehead, which does not exist in the current build.\n\n\n\n\nFurther enhancements include new camp idle animations, new Legendary Actions in Honour Mode, and a trove of bug fixes. Larian states Patch 6 is a hefty one, so it will be providing full patch notes on the BG3 website at a later date.\n\n\nNo release timeframe was given for the update, but with Valentine's Day right around the corner, I'd have to imagine a kissing-centric patch may try to coincide with that timeframe.\n\n\nPatch 6 marks the sixth big addition to Baldur's Gate 3 that Larian has developed since the cRPG released in August. Each one has added something new while also implementing a ton of bug fixes between the patch and hotfix releases. On our end, we've been tracking Larian's patch cadence with a BG3 update history and schedule. \n\n\nI don't know about you but it may be time to finally start that next BG3 playthrough. I've been wanting to try a Dark Urge run, but I'm not too sure that fits the theme of the romantic improvements.

          "description": "Whatever happened to the old Discworld games? Well, they pretty much ceased to be a thing around the late 90s. However, there is a glimmer of hope that the retro point-and-click adventure series may return, so long as it bypasses a small bit of red tape.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Time Extension, developer Gregg Barnett – co-founder of the now-defunct Perfect Entertainment studio – suggests a rerelease of Discworld could happen. Now, this is a big \"if\" and it's dependent on what the Crown has to say about it.\n\n\nImage via Adventure Gamers.\n\n\nYou see, thanks to a rather unusual law surrounding intellectual properties from UK outfits that are no longer in operation, King Charles III technically owns the rights to the games. Barnett says that \"whenever something closes in the UK, intellectual property rights revert 50% to the original creator and 50% to the Crown.\" In short: it sounds like he'd need to go ask the British head of state for permission before any rerelease can happen.\n\n\nA blast from the royal past\n\n\nFor those who don't know, the late Terry Pratchett's famed fantasy series was adapted into a number of video games back in the day. Discworlds 1 and 2 released in 1995 and 1996, respectively, while Discworld: Noir came out in 1999. After that, we never saw hide nor her of them in digital format.\n\n\nHowever, King Charles' technical ownership of the franchise aside, we may get to see them live again at some point. Whether they'll just be rereleases or full remasters can't be said at this stage. Barnett says that it could potentially \"advance to new versions.\" However, it's a \"complicated process when you’re dealing with the Crown.\" Ain't that the truth...\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about intellectual property rights in the UK (and who doesn't), you can read about it here. Big shoutout to our own Paula for sending that my way.\n\nThe post Discworld could get a rerelease, providing King Charles III permits it appeared first on Destructoid.",

The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint.

This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid.

It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Whenever a Mario Kart entry arrives, it immediately becomes a must-have on its respective platform, thanks to its universal appeal to gamers of all experience and ability levels. That widespread appeal has translated to sales, as nearly every Mario Kart game ranks near the top of its platform's sales chart. But it goes beyond mainstream success; Mario Kart is fun whether you're spending the evening alone perfecting a drift around a corner or gathering your closest friends for a marathon session. \nSure, the rubberband A.I. and the randomization elements are enough to make us want to jump up and down in frustration, but it's never quite enough to deter us from driving up to the next starting line. Check out our ranking of the entire Mario Kart series below, and let us know how you would rank…",

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.\nWhile 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.\nThe developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.\nAfter 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...\n#deadcells https://t.co/CqbNvNXGu1 pic.twitter.com/RAz8OL1SCC\nFebruary 9, 2024\nAlong with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, \"The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!\" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.\nFor more on Evil Empire, you can read Game Informer's impressions of the Dead Cells: Return to Castelvania DLC.",

Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.",

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.\nOther interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.\n\n\nThe series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.",

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.\nThere is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.\n\nI am not a fan of the genre Suicid…",

If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! \nGame Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. \nCheck out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: \n\n\nAll three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12. \nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.\nNow, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.\nAnd for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.\nIn July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. \"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced,\" Iizuka says. \"The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time.\"\nBy adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.\nSonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here. You can also visit our exclusive coverage hub by heading here.",

          "description": "V Rising, the popular survival action RPG, is branching away from PC and making its way to PS5 sometime this year. The news was announced during today’s State of Play.\nThe game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. \n\n\nInterestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.\nIf that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. \n\n\nKojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. \nHe then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"",

Movie companies Voltage Holdings, Millennium Funding, and Capstone Studios, served the subpoena on Cox Communications, which in turn gave those accused an opportunity to object to the disclosure of their identities. When one subscriber did just that, the court took a closer look at the DMCA subpoena disclosure 'shortcut.'\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.\nHelp us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.\n>",

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
