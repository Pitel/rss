          "description": "Insight from Pokémon World Champions and Temtem’s Director.\nIn 1998 my Canadian elementary school banned everything to do with Pokémon. The games, the trading cards, and discussions about the anime – all of it was off-limits as Pocket Monster fever swept through North America like a swarm of Rattata, distracting us from our in-class reading of Anne of Green Gables. That did not stop me and my classmates from passing notes about whether or not there really was a Mew beneath the truck parked near the S.S. Anne when Mrs. Hubbard turned her back. Nor did it stop us from pitying those poor souls whose parents would not buy them a Game Boy, let alone a copy of Pokémon Red or Blue. To us, that was a step removed from child abuse.\nMany people can relate similar anecdotes about playing the quintessentially classic Red and Blue. By ‘quintessential’ I mean Pokémon games stand out as some of the most memorable and influential gaming experiences ever made. Yet the special thing about Pokémon is this phenomenon which isn’t exclusive to those of us in Canada or born around 1990. Up until this year’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, every mainline Pokémon game is a classic for another generation of kids the world over. Somehow, Pokémon developer Game Freak continues to capture cultural touchstone after cultural touchstone as if it were as easy as catching a Caterpie.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We’d forgive you for assuming it refers to an obscure power metal band or maybe the title of a 1990s mech-based anime. In reality, Biomotor Unitron is a mech-building role-playing game originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color way back in 1999 – which is also pretty cool. But does this retro title, now available on Nintendo Switch eShop, live up to the evocative image its name invokes?\nIn Biomotor Unitron, you assume the role of a Unitron Master. In other words, a pilot of a meteor-powered mech suit called a Unitron. Unitron Masters the world over gather in the city of Rhafiace to compete in arena battles in order to eventually earn the rank of Master of Masters (yes, you read that right). A handful of characters add a little colour to the adventure and there’s a Big Bad to defeat, but by no means is this narrative one to remember.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As expected, it gave us a pretty in-depth look at the new entries to the core series, unveiling some new Pokémon, the game's professors and rival characters, the two new legendaries, and the box art. In addition, we learned a bit more about what the games themselves will entail, including a full open world to be explored at will, along with 4-player cooperative multiplayer.\nGiven that the game seems to be a pretty significant step up in quality — at least in terms of exploration and connectivity — we wanted to know whether the latest trailer has done enough to convince you to jump back into the Pokémon universe.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Die another day.\nThese days, it feels like you can hardly go a week without seeing another handful of games that are inspired by any combination of Metroidvanias, Soulslikes, or roguelikes. Souldiers—the first release from a new development studio called Retro Forge—is an interesting blend of those first two genres, pulling some of the best elements from both to make for a potent and memorable experience. Though Souldiers doesn’t quite manage to stick the landing perfectly, it does enough right that it certainly warrants a fair look.\nSouldiers initially takes place in the kingdom of Zarga, which is at war with the neighboring country of Dadelm. Following the advice of the court magician, General Brigard leads his regiment through a cave to set up a counterattack, only for an earthquake to strike and trap all of them inside. Some time later, a mysterious Valkyrie appears and tells the warriors that they all unfortunately died, but they can come along with her if they’d like another shot at life. Left with little choice, Brigard chooses to go with the Valkyrie and is joined by some of his men, who soon find themselves in the land of Terragaya—a dangerous realm between life and death. Here, Brigard and his men hope to get to the bottom of what led to their demise, and perhaps even find some way to come back to life to save their kingdom.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.\r\n\nThat's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.\nRead more",

It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.\nYet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.\nRead more",

It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).\nIn the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.\nRead more",

We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.\r\n\n\r\nThat said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex.

In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year?

Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is \"about as big as an Alsatian\" and \"basically a bin-bag full of girders\".

Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.\nI'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022.

          "description": "Tower of Power, Too Sweet to be Sour\nThis week's retro release from Hamster takes us back to the birth of a Namco legend — now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch from the Arcade Archives, it's the legendary Tower of Druaga.\nReleased to Japanese arcades in 1984, before later finding its way to early home computers and consoles, The Tower of Druaga is a simple maze game with surprisingly deep lore. The game follows the adventures of the brave knight Gilgamesh, who must ascend the 60-story tower to rescue the beautiful maiden Ki from a terrifying, multi-limbed demon — the titular \"Druaga.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCCGIP4SifE\nA proto-procedurally generated title, Tower of Druaga randomizes its 60 floors on every playthrough, with players fighting off ghosts, slimes, and other nasties while gathering a sackful of special items in order to progress further and further up the increasingly challenging locale. As simplistic as the title looks in the video above, (courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming), this Namco classic had a complex development, with director Masanobu Endo determined to make a deep and engaging RPG experience.\nThe Tower of Druaga is today considered the first entry in the \"Babylonian Castle Saga,\" a series that has gone on to include a slew of releases including The Return of Ishtar (1986), The Destiny of Gilgamesh (1994), and Arika's 2004 release The Nightmare of Druaga. Additionally, a spin-off anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, was produced and released by studio Gonzo in 2008. Not a bad legacy for one of both Namco and the arcade scene's formative adventures.\nThe post Witness the birth of a legend with Arcade Archives’ The Tower of Druaga appeared first on Destructoid.",

Every so often I'll talk about the feeling of playing through say, an action game, and picking up drastically different outfits for party members: and it's sort of indescribably fun to me. That includes this FFVII Remake Sailor Moon mod from juijub.\nThankfully, PC modding has made the practice of outfit unlocks easier than ever. As in, you literally download a file for the FFVII Remake Sailor Moon mod, and boom! You get the fan-made equivalent of a $10 DLC during the Xbox 360 era. Wild, right? This mod takes the base concept of Sailor Mars, Sailor Moon, and Tuxedo Mask, and applies them to Tifa, Aerith, and Cloud respectively. It's quite the power trio, but the combo fits Aerith perfectly, from her move set even down to her hairstyle.\n\nSo as usual, you can pick up the invisible weapon mod for Tifa from creator Narknon, which helps all Tifa costume mods sing. This hair color mod (also by juijub) lets you mix and match to fit the Sailor Moon costumes.\nAfter this, be sure you check out the recent Final Fantasy X outfit mod!\nThe post These FFVII Remake Sailor Moon mod outfits are perfect appeared first on Destructoid.",

But a leak of classified military information in order to win a fight on an internet forum for War Thunder, a game about tanks.\nThis is somehow the third time this has happened on the War Thunder forums. The first happened in July 2021, as a War Thunder player posted classified documents in an effort to prove a point about one of the in-game tanks.\nLater that year, the same thing happened again. A player got into an argument about a French battle tank, and to win the sparring match, they posted a part of the tank manual.

          "description": "The PS5 hits an important milestone\nEven with how difficult it is to get a PS5 these days, Sony is still doing well for itself, because the PS5 just surpassed 20 million units sold. Veronica Rogers, SVP, Head of Global Sales and Business Operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, broke the news to GamesIndustry.biz, and expressed how \"thrilled\" the company was to have reached this milestone for its newest console. Part of me has to wonder how many of those are currently stacked up in scalpers' houses, but it's still an impressive feat nonetheless.\nSony has struggled to keep up with demand for the PS5 since its launch in November of 2020 due to the ongoing chip shortage, but even so, it managed to reach 20 million units sold after one year, six months, and twenty-two days, only about three months later than the PS4 did. According to a tweet from games analyst Daniel Ahmad, the PS5 actually hit 10 million units faster than its predecessor, and \"the issues with supply is why it's behind now.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1532744064516382722\nRogers continued on in her statement to GamesIndustry.biz to speak directly to players who are still waiting for their chance to purchase a console: \"To those fans who have yet to get their hands on a console, please know that we are planning on a significant ramp-up in PS5 production this year and we are working endlessly to make sure that PlayStation 5 is available for everyone who wants one.\"\nIt doesn't seem like the chip shortage is letting up any time soon, but it's nice to hear that Sony has a plan to make the PS5 more accessible to those who might want one. That's a nice sentiment, but I think this is just one of those situations that I'm going to have to see to believe. Here's hoping some more consoles are coming soon, because I certainly don't want to miss out on any of the exciting new titles PlayStation has on the way.\nThe post PS5 surpasses 20 million units sold, Sony to ramp up production appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's up for grabs on the Epic Games Store this week, and you've got until Thursday, June 9 to claim this (worth playing!) PC game.\nIt's something that many of us have already played by now thanks to years and years of deals, but I'm sure some of you reading this haven't tried it yet, and I'd nudge you in that direction. I'm trying to put myself back in that 2014 headspace right now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjKMjIE1rs\nI remember being surprised by how much I enjoyed the story — though, at the time, I was admittedly coming in for the FPS action, not necessarily the narrative. You can't help but root for B.J. Blazkowicz every step of the way, and Wolfenstein: The New Order feels really personal. You're out to brutalize every Nazi you see, naturally, but there are hard-hitting themes and genuine character moments in the mix, too. MachineGames swung for the fences, and it paid off; The New Order showed up in Game of the Year discussions.\nWith that said, even if you lack a soft spot for the Wolfenstein series (or have no personal history with it whatsoever), you can absolutely have a good time with this game.\nWolfenstein II: The New Colossus was an increasingly out-there sequel, and not all of its zanier moments landed, but I still mostly dug the game and would be super on board for a (hopefully more well-rounded) Wolfenstein III. Yes, Indiana Jones is cool too. But come on!\nNext week's free game is a mystery\nFans will be playing the waiting game for a while, it seems.

To be clear this isn't a place you can go directly in the game: it's an elaborate theming of a season pass track, which provides rewards for players. That said, it does provide a series of radio plays for everyone to enjoy. The first part can be found below!\nHere's the setup for the Dread Island storyline:\n\"The Franklin family was riding high after embarking on an ambitious flight around the world. That is, until a turbulent storm led to a crash landing over uncharted territory, referred to by locals only as 'Dread Island.' The island’s ever-shifting environment is brimming with hidden treasures, ancient civilizations, and natural wonders waiting to be discovered, but it hides many dangers, as well. Cutthroat bandits, ferocious beasts, and the fury nature itself threaten even the sturdiest of adventurers who happen to wash up on Dread Island’s shores.\"\n\nContinuing to do seasons this way is genius. When I'm not playing Fallout 76, it's fun to look in and at least acknowledge the effort the team is putting into something that is ostensibly a dressed-up battle pass. As far as what's new, there will be quicker rank-ups for Fallout 1st members, as well as bonus rewards/challenges.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5YVUpnziW8\nThe post Fallout 76’s new season is a take on King Kong, adds quicker rank-ups appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "That throwing stick stunt of yours has boomeranged on us\nAs I played Belle Boomerang, my husband looked over my shoulder and asked if it was difficult. “Yes,” I replied, “but I have it set to retro difficulty.” He asked if I was going to review it, which I confirmed. “Why would you make it harder on yourself?” he asked.\nThere are a few reasons. The first is that I like the challenge. I also feel the need to play on the difficulty the developer “intended,” which is something that might not always exist. Finally, I have a chip on my shoulder. I’ve been strengthened in the crucible of retro games. I’ve climbed Castlevania and conquered Contra. Should be a cakewalk.\nIt wasn’t, but then, that’s what I enjoyed most about Belle Boomerang.\n\nBelle Boomerang (PC)\nDeveloper: Narwhalnut\nPublisher: Nar…",

          "description": "The bundle is up now, but it unlocks on June 8\nSo uh, don't buy the KOTOR Switch bundle until after June 8, when the second game is out. Weird, right? Bundles and the eShop: sometimes a bad combination!\nAs we've established, Knights of the Old Republic II is out on June 8. KOTOR 1 came out on Switch on November 11, 2021. If you individually buy the latter outside of the bundle, you can play it right now, no issues. But if you buy the bundle, KOTOR 1 will be locked to the SKU of the second game, and won't work until June 8. Lame, right? Especially when you consider that the bundle saves you zero dollars (each game is $15, and the bundle is $30).\nThe flaw was pointed out by Redditor hyp3rstrike, who purchased the bundle, and found out that the first game wouldn't boot, getting the \"you cannot play this software or downloadable content yet\" message. According to another poster in the same thread, they were able to get a \"one-time refund\" for the KOTOR Switch bundle, but were allegedly told to read the fine print on how bundles work.\nNow, this has happened before with bundles, and isn't a completely unique situation. But it's worth a PSA, and the practice is still stupid, even in 2022! Bundles that involve SKUs of games that are currently out, especially when said collection has you download each game separately (which the KOTOR Switch bundle does), should just work. Unless something is changed, consider this a warning for the KOTOR Switch bundle and others like it on the eShop.\nGiven the popularity of the Star Wars franchise, a lot of folks have called into Nintendo customer support about this: so fingers crossed it gets pushed up the chain and gets fixed eventually. On the other side of the equation, the fact that the bundle serves no purpose, with no monetary savings, also stings.\nThe post PSA: The KOTOR Switch bundle saves no money, and locks you out of the first game until the second is out appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fox-yyy\nFun news for adventure-loving PlayStation fans this morning, as indie outfit Finji has announced that its celebrated adventure title Tunic will bring its adorable brand of exploration and mystery to both PS4 and PS5 this September.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKlcpXPvB2o\nReleased on PC and Xbox platforms back in March of this year, Tunic is the tale... tail of an intrepid young fox who goes on a dangerous quest to free the soul of a once-legendary hero known only as The Heir. Our nameless hero explores the dense forests, ancient ruins, and dark, dingy caverns of a strange, fantasy kingdom, gathering the all-important pages of an ancient document that is said to contain the power to free The Heir from their prism prison. Battle monsters, solve puzzles, and uncover myriad secret pathways en route to glory.\nTunic received almost universal praise from critics and the video game community, praising its stylish but cute visuals, challenging combat, and its seemingly endless array of secrets and mysteries to be unfurled. With great boss battles, a fantastic and immersive soundtrack, and a compelling story of bravery, courage, and determination, Tunic won over almost all players and critics who encountered it, and is now getting set to spread its fine spirit among a whole new audience of players on PlayStation.\nTunic launches September 27 on PlayStation platforms. It is available to purchase right now on PC and Xbox.

While the jury is out on the Expansion Pack concept as a whole, the controllers seem to be doing fairly well for Nintendo. When they're in stock, that is.\nRemember how Nintendo said restocks would start up in 2022? So this is the page for the Nintendo 64 controllers for Nintendo Switch. Currently, it's out of stock. I know! In some ways this is a \"too late\" moment, but very few people actually were able to provide the proper heads-up, because they sold out in minutes (some estimates are at roughly nine minutes or less).\nThis is more of a PSA that Nintendo is seemingly continuing to restock the Switch Online N64 controllers, and to be vigilant if you're still gunning for them. Remember: these are only available for Switch Online members, which helps theoretically cut down on bots and scalping: except...not really, if they're going out of stock instantly anyway. The going rate on eBay right now (confirmed sold) is roughly anywhere from $80 to $125, which is a bit richer than the $49.99 MSRP. For reference, the Sega Genesis control pads are also sold out.\nOh, and another tip! Once it comes back in, note this trick that Wario64 and others have been circulating: add a stylus to push the order over the edge for free shipping.\nRecent 2022 Switch Online N64 controllers restocks:\nMay 19\nJune 1\nThe post PSA: Switch Online N64 controllers are still getting 2022 restocks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lock 'n' Loaded\nPlucky underdog fighter DNF Duel may only be a couple of weeks away from launch, but that fact, apparently, will not prevent it from revealing even more roster members. Check out this new trailer from publisher Nexon, which gives us our first in-action look at what may prove to be DNF Duel's final launch roster fighter: Launcher.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTbz8Ouj6z0&amp;t\nIn a somewhat terrifying 30 seconds, our tech-savvy, firepower-obsessed gal lets rip on her opposition with a ridiculous variety of firearms — all of which seem practically conjured out of thin air. From rocket launchers to miniguns, laser rifles to Bayonetta-style twin guns, Launcher not only comes loaded for bear, but is seemingly fully equipped for every single eventuality. The new girl closes out the round by calling a devastating cyber-cannon onto the playfield, voguing like a true diva as her opponent enters the stratosphere.\nMany anime fighters as of late have introduced at least one firearms-based character, and usually with extremely effective results, (I'm looking at you, Happy Chaos). Whether Launcher proves to be just as frustrating to deal with as her bang-bang brethren remains to be seen, but her debut trailer certainly makes an impact. I'm not ready to face a bevy of these ladies in an online capacity. That's for sure.\nRollback don't fail me now.\nDNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. While you wait for its impending arrival, you have enough time to check out the character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.\nThe post DNF Duel unveils its firepower-obsessed tech head, Launcher appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Due on March 31, and naturally 'at a later date on Switch'\nAfter a tease late last year, people cracked the code, and recognized a subtle flute melody from the Ubisoft game Child of Light. And lo and behold, confirmed this morning by 505 Games, there's going to be a Bloodstained Child of Light crossover.\nAurora, the hero from 2014's Child of Light, is entering the fray. She has a light story reason for being there, having \"awoken in a strange, dangerous new land.\" She'll wield the Sword of Matildis from her game, and will be accompanied by the cute floating blob wisp Igniculus (who will slow enemies and heal Aurora).\nTo level up she can transmute things via the NPC Johannes, and absorb shards over time to upgrade her abilities. Defeating bosses will push her even further, giving her a similar arc to Miriam where she can unlock new movement powers to traverse to more areas.\nThankfully, like some prior DLC, starting as Aurora is streamlined: you just start a new save file and choose between Miriam, Zangetsu, or Aurora with a handy menu (505 also reminds us that selecting Bloodless is possible with naming a save \"BLOODLESS\" in caps).\nSo as per usual, the crossover character will arrive on March 31 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms, but not Switch. The latter will arrive \"at a later date,\" which is code for \"whenever we can get it even remotely playable.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkyHqGBEoJU\n[Update: The \"later date\" Switch edition of the Bloodstained Child of Light crossover has finally come.

In the final moments of last night's event, we saw Obi-Wan Kenobi locked in combat with Darth Vader. The feared Sith Lord is one of the new skins that is unlockable when you purchase this season's battle pass. At a later date in the battle pass bonus tier, archaeologist Indiana Jones will join the fight.\nFortnite Chapter 3, Season 3 is officially called Vibin', and true to form, it brings a colorful, party atmosphere to its new story thread and areas of the map. On the eastern coast, you'll see two new areas to explore: Rave Cave and Reality Falls. These Biomes feature giant mushrooms to bound across, as well as waterfalls and strange trees to interact with.\nThe tallest tree is called the Reality Tree and it's in full bloom, spreading Reality Seed Pods across the island. If you grab a seed and plant it, a Reality Sapling will grow. If you weed it, you'll be rewarded loot. The more times a sapling is uprooted, the better the loot. Yes, you can get Mythic weapons this way.\nOn the gameplay front, you can now use animals as mounts. If you see a wolf or boar, see if you can catch a ride. Ballers are also back thanks to the reappearance of the Screwballer amusement park ride. The Ballers have more health than before, can float on water, and are battery-operated, meaning you know how long the ride will be.\nWe'll have to wait to see what other surprises and changes await us in Vibin', but it's off to a great start, and you gotta love seeing Indiana Jones and Darth Vader joining the character ranks.\nWhat did you think of the Collision event? And are you excited to jump into this new season? Let us know in the comments section below.",

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.\nArriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with MinnMax contributer and former Game Informer editor Joe Juba (@Joejuba) \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "Amazon Games has partnered with Disruptive Games, the studio behind Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and Diablo II: Resurrected, to create a new intellectual property that will release on a variety of machines. Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.\nThe humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.\nIn a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. \"The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we're excited to help bring to players.\" \nOn Disruptive's official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed \"super secret project.\" We'll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it's a long way off.",

On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called \"Collision.\" This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.\nThe events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.\nEpic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.\nIf you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.\nIf you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.\nWhat do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?",

The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we're pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today's spoiler-filled breakdown.\n\n\nAlex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom's surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven't played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.\nThe boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon's return.\nAre you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn't too long as Capcom's next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

          "description": "Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. \nAs we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. \nUnfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week. \nWhat do you think of the combat in Sonic Frontiers?

It turns out Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is actually coming to PC this year, too, according to a PlayStation Blog Post spotted by IGN. However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. \nOddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  \nThe original story continues below...\nOriginal story, 6/2/22:\nHave you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. \nThe remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.\nThat’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.\nWant more? You can watch the reveal trailer above, which showcases the announcement and all the awesome action in store for Peter Parker.",

          "description": "We haven't seen the jaw-dropping, peaceful-seeming indie since last year. Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today's State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.\n\n\nSeason won't task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season's sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won't be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when \"the season\" ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.\nAs the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:\nThe title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.",

In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  \nThe game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you're doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.\nStudio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action for yourself. \nSo get ready to hold hands, makeout, and fight to stay alive when Eternights debuts on PS5, PS4, and PC sometime in early 2023.",

A new bloodsport called rollerdrome will apparently become all the rage in that year. Rollerdrome is in development at Roll7, the studio behind the OlliOlli series, and will be published by Private Division on August 16 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.\nAnyone can compete in this deadly game, but the deck is stacked against them, as they take on house players (much like the American Gladiators show). The goal of each competitor is to achieve the highest score possible, by combining rollerskate tricks with eliminations. The player assumes the identity of Kara Hassan as she enters her first match. Your goal is to rise the ranks and hopefully become the Rollerdome champion – meaning you stay alive.\n“It’s been amazing to see this project come to life from the original prototype that received a lot of love online, all the way to the brutal and intense experience it is now – thanks to the amazing work of the team at Roll7,″ Paul Rabbitte, creative director at Roll7, said. “We’re really excited for players to jump into Rollerdrome.”",

As for the trailer, it showcased more of the behind-the-cat, third-person (err, third-feline?) gameplay central to the game. As previously seen, this stray cat inhabits a very cyberpunk-esque world, filled with robots and more. As for the titular stray cat's place in all this, it seems they're on a mission to help inhabitants of this world and ultimately, find a way home. \nYou can watch the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere's what publisher Annapurna Interactive has to say about Stray: \"In Stray, players take the role of a stray cat who must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity amidst the detailed neon-lit alleys and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B12.

The game got a new trailer at today’s presentation, along with a December 2 launch date.\nFor those not in the know, Striking Distance Studios is led by Glen Schofield, the same person who helped lead development of the original Dead Space way back in 2008. Even as EA is actively working on a remake of that original game, Schofield’s team is charting out a new universe of horror that is clearly inspired by the gameplay and visual palette of that older game.\nIn the new trailer, we get an extensive glimpse at the gory and terrifying gameplay in store for players when the game launches later this year. We see protagonist Jacob Lee as he makes his way through one scary-looking outer space locale to the next, often with the looming presence of the gas giant planet of Jupiter overhead.  \nJacob wanders through tight and dimly lit corridors before an array of monsters manage to get to him. We see an interesting mix of melee and ranged weapons that the scared hero can wield. But even with some helpful toys, things don't always go well for Jacob. Striking Distance is pulling no punches in regard to what happens to their lead character if players don’t manage to pull him out of trouble. In one especially disturbing concluding sequence, we see one of the creatures tear a portion of his head and face off in what is almost certainly a preface to a game over screen.\nThe Callisto Protocol just happens to be this month’s cover story at Game Informer, and you can head over to our game hub to check out all the info we’ve got on the game as it becomes available.\nIn the meantime, check out the trailer in all its creepy glory, and watch for The Callisto Protocol's release on December 2 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

While the brief trailer didn't show much in the way of gameplay, it did show various locations and characters from the game, and most importantly, a release date: March 24, 2023.\nMost strikingly – and predictably – the new Resident Evil 4 looks leagues better visually than its 2005 counterpart. During the minute-long trailer, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy, antihero Ada Wong, Ashley Graham, Luis, and brief glimpses of antagonists Osmund Saddler and Bitores Mendez. The trailer also shows quick looks at Salazar Castle and the iconic village from the beginning of RE4 and the baddies that inhabit them. The voiceover seems to indicate the game's story has been expanded and will act as a more direct sequel to Resident Evil 2, which also stars Leon as its protagonist. \nThe trailer ends with a brief tease that VR content is also in development for Resident Evil 4. \nSee the trailer in full below.\n\n\nThis is just the latest in the long line of Resident Evil remakes – which, if you're being exact, starts all the way back on the GameCube with the remake of the original 1996 game. In 2019, developer-publisher Capcom released a remake of Resident Evil 2, which was then followed by a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake in 2020. And if you're being technical, this is actually the second Resident Evil 4 remake in as many years – kind of.

If they find a new gear set they prefer, they can take on all the stats of it while keeping the look of their favorite set thanks to transmog. \n\n\nElsewhere, this update allows players to completely reset their skills and redistribute skill points. That's going to be especially helpful for players who need to reshape their build in a new difficulty now live in Horizon Forbidden West: Ultra Hard difficulty. \nGuerrilla Games has been hard at work fixing visual problems with the game through multiple patches, such as shimmering in foliage and elsewhere, and today's update includes \"improved visual fidelity.\" There's no word on exactly what that addresses but it's probably safe to say the game will look better after installing the update.

The big man will kick off the proceedings live starting at 4:45 p.m. CT for a little preshow where he'll give you some predictions and bring the hype. But what can people expect from today's State of Play? According to the official PlayStation Blog, fans can look forward to: \"exciting reveals from our third-party partners, plus a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation VR2.\" We know one of those games is Horizon Call of the Mountain, developer Guerrilla Games' and Firesprite's collaboration featuring one of Sony's biggest franchises.\nWe know PSVR2 will be featured, but what else can fans look forward to? With an emphasis on third-party titles, there's been plenty of speculation on whether or not Capcom or Square Enix may make an appearance. The former has plenty for PlayStation fans to be excited about, including Resident Evil Village DLC and the recently announced Street Fighter 6. The latter also has big games coming to the PS5, including Forspoken and Final Fantasy XVI. Will any of the games listed make an appearance? Did I just jinx us, and now we're not getting anything listed in this article? Only time will tell, but that's why you have to tune in later today.\nThank you so much for watching. If you enjoy our watch-along streams, be sure to subscribe to our Twitch pages to get notified the second we go live and to get access to our tremendous exclusive Discord.",

          "description": "No longer shall it be called Dragon Age 4, as developer BioWare has revealed a new name for the upcoming RPG that will henceforth be known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.\nA blog post announcing the title also goes into one possible meaning behind it. It's of course a reference to Solas, AKA The Dread Wolf, who happens to share a moniker with the game, although with a slight difference in spelling. Once an ally to players, this Solas is being set up as the big bad in Dreadwolf. The post describes him as maybe being \"an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people…or a savior who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world. His motives are inscrutable and his methods sometimes questionable, earning him a reputation as something of a trickster deity—a player of dark and dangerous games.\"\nDragon Age: Dreadwolf and Solas' machinations won't see the light of day this year, according to the post, at least not in any playable form. However, there will be more information coming about the game before the year is over. Outside of that tease for upcoming details, there isn't much more to learn about the next chapter in the Dragon Age saga in the immediate future. So until then, enjoy knowing the official title and the logo above, which the studio does leave open for more meaning than just a reference to Solas.",

Starting tomorrow, a new patch will be applied to the fighting game that will add balance changes to the roster, but more importantly, also add new mechanics to the game.\nPatch 2.80 for Granblue Fantasy Versus is ushering in three new mechanics that will undoubtedly change the game in massive ways. First is Rush, a tactical move that dashes the character forward to quickly close the distance on the opponent and strike when they least expect it. Similarly, Backshift is a dash backward that allows for a quick escape from pressure or a dodge to use in dicey situations, like back-dashing on wakeup to foil the opposition's advanc…",

          "description": "Variety reported last year that a Twisted Metal series was on the way from the writers of Deadpool, and then we later learned the show will debut on Peacock. \nAnthony Mackie, perhaps best known as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (although he does have a new role in it now), was cast as the series’ star last September and now we know who will be playing the most iconic character from the Twisted Metal franchise, Sweet Tooth. It will be none other than Will Arnett, the voice of Batman in The Lego Batman Movie and the titular character in Bojack Horseman. \nThis news comes by way of Variety, which reports that Arnett will “voice” Sweet Tooth, which kind of makes it sound like Sweet Tooth will either be a CGI character or the person acting as Sweet Tooth won’t be voicing him. Or, of course, perhaps Arnett will play Sweet Tooth on set, too, while also voicing him in post-production, given the whole head-on-fire part of the character. Variety reports that the show’s Sweet Tooth is “described as a hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning,” and a “lover of chaos.”\n“[This] majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses ‘Lost Vegas’ as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck,” Variety writes.\nThe publication reports that Arnett was long-rumored for this role in addition to working as an executive producer for the show. Arnett joins Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn 99), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (the Scream franchise) in this series. \n[Source: Variety]\nAre you excited about this Twisted Metal series?

It’s basically an extended look at what was showcased yesterday and it looks great. \nRight off the bat, it’s beautiful – looking more realistic than any Sonic game before, too – and it’s clear that speed is the name of the game because there’s virtually nothing in the way of stopping the Blue Blur. It’s cliche to say, but it looks like if you see something in the distance, there’s a way for you to speed all the way over there, be it by rail, ramp, on ground, or something else. Take a look for yourself below:\n\n\nAs you can see, running isn’t all that’s in this extended gameplay look. There are plenty of Sonic staples, like on-ground boosts, bumpers, and more. Plus, there are towers that act as platforming challenges, tasking you with reaching the top. Elsewhere, there are simple puzzles to solve that involve stepping on lit switches as well as a speed wheel (think: hamster wheel, or hedgehog wheel, I suppose) that seems to do something to the surrounding area. Maybe it defogs a map, or unlocks new areas to explore. Only time will tell for now. \nUnfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer. While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted yesterday. \nWhat do you think of this gameplay?

Following John Madden's passing in December 2021, EA Sports made the call to dedicate this year's game to the man who made the franchise possible in the first place. To do so, rather than featuring an athlete on the cover of Madden NFL 23, EA Sports created three distinct covers to celebrate the three major areas of John Madden's contributions to the game of football.\nThe first cover honors John Madden's contributions to the NFL as a coach, featuring him being carried off the field on the shoulders of his players following his head coaching victor…",

On that day, you'll be able to choose between the three starters: Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly. They will likely be given to you by the new professors (yes, plural) of Generation 9: Professor Sada if you're playing Scarlet (left) and Professor Turo if you're playing Violet (right).\nYou can check them out in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nShortly after their introduction, the trailer reveals that four-player co-op will be in Scarlet and Violet, a first for the Pokémon series. It won't be limited to just online battles like in previous games, though – it seems we'll be able to explore the region with other players. Throughout the trailer, we get glimpses at returning favorites and new Pokémon, such as Pawmi, Lechonk (great name), and Smoliv.\nPlus, we see what appears to be some very Pokémon Legends: Arceus-style sleuthing and monster catching too. \nThe trailer concludes with the reveal of this generation's two primary legendaries: Karaidon, the red dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art of Scarlet, and Maraidon, the purple dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art for Violet. Both appear to live off the coast of this region, high atop some cliffs in the ocean. \n\nFor more about Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, watch the original reveal trailer, which includes a nice look at this gen's starters, and then check out our living list of every Pokémon in these games confirmed so far.

Before this update, you simply could not – the console would let you know an achievement was secret, but you’d have to search online elsewhere to determine its objective. Starting this month, you can choose to reveal secret achievements, according to a new Xbox Wire blog post, as reported by IGN. \n“If you don’t mind spoilers or want a hint on any of the achievements in the games you’re playing, it’s easy to find the secret achievement details on your Xbox,” the blog post reads. “From within a game, open the guide and go to Game Activity > Achievements. When you see a secret achievement, you can now reveal details like the title, achievement description, and Gamerscore. And after you peek, you can go back and hide it or continue to display the details. \n“You can reveal secret achievements anywhere you like to play and track your achievements from Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, the Xbox app for Android and iOS, the Xbox app for Windows PC, and Game Bar on your PC.” \nHere’s a look at how it works: \nWhile waiting for this update to download, read about how Xbox and Bethesda are hosting a games showcase next week, and then check out Game Informer’s in-house predictions for that showcase after that. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about this update?

It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. \nThis new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon. \nWhat do you think of this gameplay teaser?

This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.\nIf any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. \nPlease note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.\n>",

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
