          "description": "\"Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living\".\nKiki’s Delivery Service is a movie all about growing up. The night Kiki leaves home to complete a year of witch training, she excitedly overstuffs her bag, makes herself a broomstick that’s too small for her, and crashes into a couple of trees during her flight. She doesn’t have a speciality or skill, and upon arriving in the town of Koriko, she causes a ruckus by stopping traffic. Yet this all serves to set up Kiki’s growth, and the pain of becoming an adolescent and – eventually – an adult. She finds her place in the world, living above a bakery, delivering goods on her broomstick, and overcomes her fears to become the best version of herself.\nKiki is the heart of Studio Ghibli’s 1989 coming-of-age story, and it’s her brashness, positivity, and determination that has clearly rubbed off on Mika, the star of Chibig’s latest game, Mika and the Witch’s Mountain. There’s no greater influence here than the aforementioned movie; the premise of playing a witch delivery game with cel-shaded visuals and sprawling seas inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was enough to smash through its Kickstarter goal. Yet, two years after the potion was brewed, we’re left with a game that has flashes of the heart of the Studio Ghibli classic, but is sadly completely forgettable in almost every single respect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

In other words, it all toys with the game's \"curse\" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.\n \nRead more",

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature.

Now, horror of horrors, they’re coming for your ascii gigachads and “nobody is going to read this review so I’ll just say I’m gay” bangers. The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.\nThe new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic.

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The \"Crush Depth\" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.\nRead more",

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author.

          "description": "Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.\nIt looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.\n Read more",

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.\nRead more",

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

There are already some wonderful creations themed around them, and some involve future rookies. That said, importing them into a Franchise mode can be tricky if you haven't done it in previous Madden titles.\n\n\nHow to download future draft classes in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe Download Center will be your best friend (unless you want to sit and create the entire future draft class).\n\n\n\nStart and load the game.\n\n\nFrom the main menu, go to the first option under Download Center.\n\n\nHere, a host of different types of downloads will be available for free. The one you're looking for will be featured as Rosters. \n\n\nWhen I accessed this section, I could already find 2025 and 2026 draft classes with several downloads from the community.\n\n\nJust select one, and it will be downloaded. You can check this under the \"My Downloads\" section.\n\n\n\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to load future draft classes in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nFor this part, you'll need a new save file.\n\n\n\nFrom the Download Center, go to the last option.\n\n\nHere, you can load your custom files. Load the one you downloaded with a future draft class.\n\n\nCreate a new Franchise mode save.\n\n\nMake sure to choose a custom squad instead of using a default one.\n\n\n\nThis will automatically load your custom squad file containing future draft prospects. Do remember that the community makes all such files. There might be a chance of something going wrong in your save in the future (it might not happen, but fair warning nevertheless).\n\nThe post How to use future draft classes in Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Myth: Wukong is oftentimes compared to Soulslikes because of its difficulty and grand bosses, but are there settings to change that? If you want to get into the game but are scared of it potentially being really difficult, here’s what you need to know.\n\n\nCan you change difficulty settings in Black Myth: Wukong?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Black Myth: Wukong does not have difficulty setting options at this time. While the game might not be as difficult as Bloodborne, Sekiro, or Elden Ring, it’ll still pose quite the challenge. \n\n\nThe only way you can really alleviate the game’s difficulty is to farm up levels, or Sparks. Use them to further enhance your character’s abilities and you should hopefully turn the tide in battle against the dozens of bosses you’ll face ahead.\n\n\nAlso, you can skip a handful of bosses if you want, but it’s recommended that you don’t because they drop new items that can help you later down the line. They’ll also drop crafting materials for better gear and give you huge XP boosts upon beating them.\n\n\nYou can also upgrade your abilities like your spells and transformations so that you can deal more damage or have more use out of them, so use all you can if some of these battles are too tough.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCan you summon NPCs or other players in Black Myth: Wukong?\n\n\nIf you were hoping that you could summon an NPC to take the aggro off of you in boss battles, you can’t do that. You’re mostly alone in this game.\n\n\nWith that said, you also can not summon other players via any sort of co-op or multiplayer session. It’s up to you to take on the game with the tools you have.\n\n\nSince Black Myth: Wukong is solely a single-player game, it can deter many who need a partner or a leg up against these tough bosses. No way are they in the same realm as actual Soulslikes, but they can still be a headache for many.\n\nThe post Does Black Myth: Wukong have difficulty settings? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Devotid has announced that they have partnered with publisher Kwalee to put more resources behind The Coin Game, a strange coin-op simulator that is currently in Early Access.\n\n\nI wrote an Early Access review of The Coin Game just slightly over a year ago. I can’t possibly stress how bizarre the game is. It started as an attempt of emulating the sort of quarter-chomping prize games that you find in bowling alleys and shopping malls, and then bloomed into an open-world game set on an island of mid-western robot people. You take up side jobs in order to scrape together a bit of cash to spend at the arcades and win tickets. It’s an incredibly atmospheric game that draws you into summer directionlessness.\n\n\nHowever, it’s largely been developed by a single person. In a post on Steam, they confess, “As a stubborn do-it-ALL-yourself kind of person that was very hard to face but the game is so much bigger than me now and it had to be done.”\n\n\nThere has been some frustration over the slow development of the game. While the updates that get released always feel meaningful, they don’t come very often. It has felt like Devotid’s personal project that they pluck away at on their own time, and in that way it’s very charming. However, I am interested to see what happens when there’s a bit more horsepower pulling the cart.\n\n\nThere are no announcements beyond the partnership with Kwalee, so it’s uncertain how long it will be to see the fruits of this arrangement. For now, The Coin Game is available on Steam Early Access.\n\nThe post Bizarre ennui simulator The Coin Game hooks up with publisher Kwalee appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Netflix's hit show Squid Game continues with its upcoming mobile game, Squid Game: Unleashed. In it, you'll experience the horrors (and maybe wonders?) of the deathly games once the entry arrives to Netflix Games. \n\n\nParticipate in a 32-player battle royale-style mode featuring the infamous red light, green light game. If you're a fan of the series, you'll undoubtedly recognize Squid Game: Unleashed's many obstacle courses. Put your agility to the test and survive as long as possible to claim the ultimate prize. Currently, there's no release date set, but the Netflix page indicates that it will be \"Coming Soon.\" \n\n\n\n\nThe Squid Game: Unleashed Gamescom 2024 trailer features plenty of deathly scenarios, including getting by bus, rolling ball, and scorching lava. This is not all that surprising, especially since the show has a knack for some gnarly killings. But it'll certainly be more brutal as an actual player of the games.  \n\n\nThe Netflix show also got the green light for the highly anticipated Squid Game Season 2. The new season begins in December, which could be the perfect time for the Unleashed release. Even more so, the finale is already in the works for 2025, ending the battle royale series\n\n\nIf you want to experience the games for yourself, get ready for Squid Game: Unleashed on Netflix Games. It'll be available to play on iOS and Android, which will likely have pre-orders in the near future. \n\nThe post Netflix’s mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed gets the green light in exclusive first look appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The “one last thing” at Gamescom Opening Night Live was a reveal for a new game in the Mafia series: Mafia: The Old Country.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it didn’t tell us much aside from the fact that the game is going set in the early 1900s in Sicily. It’s going to give a look at the birth of the Mafia, so I suppose it could be considered a prequel to the entire series.\n\n\n\n\nAside from that, there was no gameplay shown. However, I got a press release afterward that says that it will involve “action brought to life by the authentic realism and rich storytelling that the critically acclaimed Mafia series is known for. It promises a “deep, linear narrative with that classic mob movie feeling.”\n\n\nHonestly, I love Mafia. I got deeply into the first game back in 2002. I enjoyed the second game. I haven’t played the third, but I should since my expectations are set appropriately low. Then Mafia: Definitive Edition is maybe not quite as definitive as the name sounds, but it was a cool revisit to the first game. On a planet where every big budget game seems to be an open-world affair crammed full of side distractions, the more linear narrative of the (first two) Mafia games, where the open world is more of a backdrop, sounds very refreshing.\n\n\nI'm weirdly hyped over a nothing trailer.\n\n\nWe’re promised that we’ll hear more about Mafia: The Old Country in December 2024. It will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Wait. That’s it? Mafia: The Old Country gets brief teaser appeared first on Destructoid.",

During today's Gamescom Opening Night Live, developer MachineGames and publisher Bethesda Softworks showed off various elements of gameplay and confirmed the action adventure title will release on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9, 2024 as a timed console exclusive before coming to PS5 in Spring 2025.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time, we got an extensive look at the gameplay that will take place in the all-new handcraft Indiana Jones story coming in The Great Circle. At its core, the name of the game in The Great Circle will be stealth. Often times it looks as though there will be plenty of enemies between Indy and his destination, making the quiet unseen route the safest and most reliable option. But when things get hairy, Indy will have options.\n\n\nUsing his signature trusty whip, players will be able to smack around, disoriented, crowd control, and subdue enemies. Every location will also have a variety of objects that the player can interact with and use to assist them in combat as well, ranging from actual weapons including firearms to random knick-knacks to throw at the enemy.\n\n\nBased on the trailer, it looks as though we'll be exploring a variety of detailed environments and solving interesting puzzles to crack the code of The Great Circle.\n\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release on December 9, 2024 on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

This is coming so fast, but I definitely saw Mega Man in there.\n\n\nSecret Level is supposedly a series of original short narratives set around various video games. It’s an incredibly eclectic mix including Armored Core, Sifu, and Spelunky alongside more mainstream stuff like Concord and God of War. Maybe also Pac-Man.\n\n\nThere's also Mega Man, but he's doing that really cliche gear-up sequence. Like, it's so ubiquitous that Doom Eternal even opened with it.\n\n\n\n\nI am entirely unable to process what’s going on. I’m not sure if there’s some sort of metanarrative here. As I mentioned, it’s reportedly going to be a series of short narratives (via Deadline), but the sizzle reel doesn’t exactly clarify that.\n\n\nThe introduction by Tim Miller was especially interesting. I mentioned to my colleagues that he sounded like he was on the verge of tears before he seemed to break further and admit his emotions. Some sounded cynical about the sincerity, but as a prolific crier, it seemed genuine. Listen, it’s sometimes easy to get emotional about stuff. I can cry pretty easily on some days. Dude might just really love showing off his team’s efforts.\n\n\nSecret Level airs December 10, 2024 on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe post Sizzle reel shows off game anthology series Secret Level – wait, was that Mega Man? appeared first on Destructoid.",

While Shattered Space isn't quite here yet, you won't have to wait long for its release, as it's coming out at the end of September this year.\n\n\n\n\nGamescom Opening Night Live 2024 revealed that Starfield will receive a free content update tonight that introduces the REV-8 space vehicle, allowing you to drive around the universe in style. It's completely separate from the expansion, so anyone who owns Starfield will get access to it. The REV-8 also features flying capabilities, a mounted turret, and armor to make combat easier. You can even drive around with companions to make space travel a little less lonely.\n\n\nBethesda also revealed during Gamescom that the Shattered Space expansion will launch on September 30, 2024. While it was known that it'd be released sometime in Fall 2024, this is the first time the exact launch date was revealed. Considering Starfield was released in September 2023, Shattered Space launching shortly after the game's one-year anniversary sounds fitting. Anyone who purchased Starfield's Premium or Constellation Editions will have access to the expansion, with premium upgrades available for anyone who wants to experience it.\n\n\nAs of now, details on other future Starfield expansions and free content updates are unknown.

The title looks similar to the Little Nightmares games but has a distinctly new and much more terrifying series of monsters to avoid. \n\n\nWhile we were only shown a brief glimpse of Reanimal, it was enough to demonstrate exactly what the gameplay looks and feels like. Players take on the role of two tiny characters a brother and sister duo, and find themselves lost in a world where creatures much bigger than them lurk. They must constantly run, hide, duck, cover, sneak, crawl, and evade colossal, strangely altered animals in order to find some sort of small sense of safety while being constantly hunted. \n\n\nDon't stop running\n\n\n\n…",

Dying Light: The Beast is a new standalone game set in the Dying Light universe, starring the original Dying Light protagonist Kyle Crane.\n\n\nRevealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, The Beast sees Crane is finally out of captivity after thirteen years, following the events of Dying Light. While things might have changed after a decade, Crane will be using his skills to survive and help save more innocent lives.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Dying Light: The Beast began its journey as DLC for Dying Light 2, Techland decided to change direction and make it a full standalone game. All Dying Light 2 Stay Human players who own the Ultimate Edition will get a free copy of the upcoming adventure. This will be excellent news for those who have waited patiently for the DLC's development.\n\n\nSet after the events of the first game, Dying Light: The Beast will offer 18+ hours of gameplay. Playing as Crane, players will seek revenge on those who subjected him to brutal experiments while in captivity. The action will be set in Castor Woods, which has been completely transformed from a popular tourist destination to a post-apocalyptic dead zone.\n\n\nThe experiments also mean that Crane will be superior to ordinary humans. Aside from zombies, players will encounter different people and factions, and not all will be friendly. In Dying Light: The Beast, Crane can use vehicles, aside from relying on his parkour skills to survive. You'll also still be able to play solo or in co-op sessions.\n\n\nDying Light: The Beast is now up for wishlist on all available platforms.
