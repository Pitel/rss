After creating two wildly different games — the twin-stick shooter Assault Android Cactus and the BAFTA award-winning, heartfelt puzzler Unpacking — it's ready to move back to the outside and go with something even more relaxing.\nWe were tapping our foot the whole way through the trailer for the Brisbane-based studio's third title, Tempopo. Combining music with the outside world, the game sees Hana — a young magical girl living in the clouds — restoring her musical garden of flowers. All of her Tempopo creatures have magical abilities and are bursting with personality, but only Hana can tell them where to go and guide them along the right path.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's probably the haunting presence of Luigi's Mansion 2 HD which will be bringing the spooks to Switch this Thursday (27th June). We have already shared our thoughts on Nintendo's latest remaster, calling it \"the exact same game that many of you will have no doubt played 11 years ago - it just looks much nicer\" in our review and now Digital Foundry has stepped in to provide a full technical analysis on the release.\nAll in all, things look rather swell. Naturally, the majority of the Digital Foundry analysis is dedicated to the visual upgrade, calling it a \"smart, clean enhancement\" and noting the massive boost in polygon count. According to the outlet, the remaster targets native 1080p in docked mode and 720p in handheld, with anti-aliasing on both offering some of the console's \"best image quality\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

They were fiddly in the first Luigi's Mansion, and in the second game the lack of an extra thumbstick on the 3DS made for an experience that felt marred slightly by the shortcomings of the system on which it was delivered. It wasn't a huge deal — this writer is still very much in agreement with the 9/10 score dished out by this site at the time — it was always just one of those things with this series. A great idea, smart games, excellent puzzles and tons of atmosphere, all held back a little bit.

If you remember, the company filed trademarks for the title at the start of the year, but we weren't too sure what it was all about at the time.\nAlthough there's no word on a worldside release at the time of writing, Pand Land is available via Android and iOS in Japan. Described as a casual marine adventure RPG, you travel the lands with your crew to collect various bits of treasure. Boasting some rather charming voxel-based visuals, you'll also explore dangerous dungeons and can tackle the game either on your own or with friends.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

However, in keeping with franchise tradition, it’s yet another game that just can’t quite hit the home run, combining a solid single-player experience with a bunch of multiplayer modes that, frankly, aren’t worth the price of admission or the time investment.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The RPG in question is Broke Signal Badlands: A World of Desert Adventure, and yes, that's a very upbeat subtitle for a game in which you can perish after getting your hand stuck in the door of an abandoned Fonts Museum, or while yanking cacti out of your foot. There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I've only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Word on the reviewvine is that it's jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker's shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.\n  \nRead more",

Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game's background is performing with his idle hands.

Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

          "description": "A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.\nSpoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.\n \nRead more",

This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough.

Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game's protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea.

          "description": "Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.\nJim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. \"It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,\" he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.\n Read more",

Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form.

          "description": "Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993's Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It's a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don't talk about their sacrifices enough. It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.\n Read more",

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, \"It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it\".\nI was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all.

I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.\nIt's an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.\n Read more",

From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.\nRead more",

Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which \"only\" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.\n Read more",

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term \"open up\" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke.

          "description": "The Elden Ring DLC is a tough piece of video game, but thankfully it isn't completely malicious. The DLC includes more ways to strengthen your character, such as new Talismans. I suggest you find the Spelldrake Talisman +3 in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for the best magic defense.\n\n\nThe Spelldrake Talisman +3 is in a cave along a cliffside near the 'Castle Front' encampment Site of Grace. If you have the Site unlocked, you can start your quest for the Talisman there. If not, you'll need to travel to the Castle Front encampment located northeast from where you begin Shadow of the Erdtree. To get there, you must cross the Ellac Greatbridge, which has a few enemies and a guy guarding the encampment with a large ballista that fires tree-sized bolts — which explode.

          "description": "One of the most enduring parts of Beyond Good & Evil for me is its soundtrack. Now I can relive it (as if it hasn’t lived in my head since 2003), with the Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary soundtrack on vinyl.\n\n\nTwo tracks in particular are standouts for me. The first is Slaughterhouse Scramble, which includes what I am pretty sure are gibberish lyrics sung by someone who is just so damned invested in their performance. Say what you will about the crunchy, three power-chord backing, but that vocalist is just wrecking house.\n\n\nAnother is what I think the album calls “Salud Juanito!” but I remember it as either “Spanish Bar” or “Fun and Mini Games.” I don’t understand Spanish, so I don’t know what to say about this one aside from the fact that it’s a banger.\n\n\nWe had a foosball table in the house, which I used to play with a roommate. I created a playlist, and both of these songs were on it. There was a third on there that was more of a boss theme. It was called “Dancing with DomZ” on old internet playlists, but I’m not sure what it’s listed on the album.\n\n\nAnyway. Back to the Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary vinyl. It’s two discs and pressed into orange and green marbled vinyl. These mighty slabs contain 39 tracks from the game. I highlighted two, but the soundtrack is solid as a whole, with some great variety. I’d probably buy it but I’d need more storage for my vinyl.\n\n\nThe Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary soundtrack is scheduled for release in September 2024, and is being sold by Wayo Records.\n\nThe post Put Slaughterhouse Scramble in your speakers with Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary vinyl appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Final Shape expansion introduced a proverbial ton of content into Destiny 2. From a new campaign and Exotic weapons to Subclass and weapon balance updates, post-The Final Shape Destiny 2 is almost like a new game. However, Bungie is now rolling back one change after players got vocal about their disapproval. Elemental Surges are no more in the Raid and Dungeon scene, or at least, they don't matter anymore. \n\n\nPlayers weren't in love with all the changes introduced by The Final Shape. Specifically, many Guardians weren't fans of the -5 power disadvantage and elemental Surges imposed by Raids and Dungeons. The idea was that, as long as players used weapons and abilities highlighted by the Surges, the -5 wouldn't matter. However, players took the change as a limitation on builds and weapon choice since elements not benefitting from the Surge would be at that -5 power deficit.\n\n\nOn June 20, Bungie addressed the Surge situation in a This Week in Destiny post, announcing, \"We have decided to remove surges from raids and dungeons in next week's update, as well as to adjust tuning so that you'll perform as if you had them across the board. This means the damage bonus will now be applied to all subclass damage types, including Kinetic, by default.\" In addition to the Surge news, Bungie reminded players that the -5 only pertained to damage output, not defenses.\n\n\nWhile the -5 disadvantage is still there in some form, forever Surges on all elements almost make it a non-issue. Of course, Bungie noted that it would monitor how the changes feel for players to see if further adjustments are needed.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 removes controversial Surges from Raids and Dungeons appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it makes completing the raid all the sweeter. Once you've completed it, you'll receive a new item that's immensely confusing at first. Here's what to do with the Memory of the Witness in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere should I take the Memory of the Witness in Destiny 2?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nOnce you get the Memory of the Witness, you'll want to run Excision. This is the new 12-player activity, and can be found next to the Salvation's Edge raid on the Pale Heart Destination Map. Once in the mission, proceed to the end, and you'll find a bonus chest. Use the Memory of the Witness on this chest to receive one of the raid weapons with a Deepsight imprint on it.\n\n\nIf you aren't already aware, this Deepsight imprint lets you use this weapon in crafting to create a god roll version of that weapon, provided you know the best perks and attachments. You will need to use this weapon a bit though to increase its pattern progress.\n\n\nCan you get multiple Memories of the Witness?\n\n\nYou can technically get multiple Memories of the Witness. However, there are a few catches to that. For one, it's once per account per week, so you can't get three each week off each of your characters. It also doesn't stack, so you should use your key as soon as possible after getting it so you don't screw yourself over later.

However, Activision is looking to shake things up a little bit with Season 4 with the introduction of an all-new game mode in the form of a unique playlist modifier called Bit Party, a pixel-inspired playlist.\n\n\n\n\nMinecraft Steve would be proud of the new mode, which allows players to experience the multiplayer of Call of Duty in a new lens. In Bit Party mode, eliminating enemies causes your Operator's head to inflate, with it resetting back to normal when you are eliminated. Even though the increased head size will certainly make you an easier target, it also gives you some perks. The bigger your head, the more points you earn for completing objectives in multiplayer.\n\n\nThe Retro Warfare event is also kicking off alongside the new playlist, as well as the addition of pixel-art-inspired members of Task Force 141 and a new 8-Bit Blitz Bundle. Pixelated Operator skins will feature Ghost, Price, Soap, and Farah, as well as a pixelated 8-Bit Tracer and red Violence Death EFfect for the Striker SMG and SVA 545 Assault Rifle.\n\n\nCall of Duty Season 4 Reloaded will also add a new Core 6v6 map titled Incline, taking place in the snowy mountains of Urzikstan. Several new game-altering modes are also launching with this season including Mutation, Havoc, Headshots Only, and Blueprint Gunfight.\n\n\nThe Call of Duty Season 4 Reloaded kicks off across all platforms on June 26 at 12p.m EST.\n\nThe post Call of Duty set to enter Season 4 with new Bit Party game mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While getting the newest weapons in Destiny 2 is almost always good, some of the older weapons are well worth snagging. One such weapon comes from one of Destiny 2's oldest raids, yet can pack a real punch with the right perks. Here are the god roll perks and attachments for the Apex Predator rocket launcher in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Apex Predator in Destiny 2\n\n\nThe Apex Predator can be acquired from any encounter within the Last Wish raid, available as a potential drop. Due to this, it receives the Origin Trait Explosive Pact. This perk grants bonus Stability and Reload Speed when using your grenade. \n\n\nHealing with your grenade or getting final blows with it grants additional Stability and Reload Speed. This makes it a great weapon for grenade-based builds since you can weave rocket shots in between. With all this in mind, these are the best attachments and perks:\n\n\n\nBarrel: Hard Launch\n\n\nMagazine: Impact Casing\n\n\nPerk 1: Reconstruction\n\n\nPerk 2: Frenzy\n\n\n\nThe perks and attachments above set this weapon up as a boss DPS weapon, improving performance and increasing damage. Hard Launch provides much faster Projectile Speed in exchange for decreased Stability, while Impact Casing refunds that lost Stability. Reconstruction makes the Apex Predator reload on its own, letting you fire off a rocket or two then switch to a Fusion Rifle or Exotic for more sustained DPS before swapping back. Finally, Frenzy causes being in the DPS phase long enough to increase damage, Handling, and Reload Speed. All of this together make it a particularly potent boss killer.\n\n\nIf you want to bring this into PvP instead of PvE, you can swap Impact Casing with High-Velocity Rounds, since the extra Reload Speed and Projectile Speed will be much more useful. You can also swap Frenzy out for Bait and Switch, since you'll use your primary and secondary more consistently.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Apex Predator god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series. \nAre you excited about a native Minecraft version for PS5? Let us know in the comments below!",

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

          "description": "Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.",

          "description": "We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.\n\n\nWhile the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule.

The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.\nFor our review of the recent Metroid Prime remaster, head here.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. \nMistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.\nFantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.",

It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…",

          "description": "Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.\nTaking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.\nThough the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.",

This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.\nThe Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.\nThis isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.\nWe absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.",

For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.\nIn an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:\nDespite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. \nBut if you don't care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. \nPieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: \nAlone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. \n\n\nFollowing the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.",

          "description": "Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.\nThe first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. \n\n\nStealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). \nInterestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. \nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
