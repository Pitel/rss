Today, Lowell considers how Pokémon could do with a rival to keep it hungry, and who might be able to step up...\n\nWhen Pokémon Sword and Shield brought Pikachu and friends to a home console for the first time in all-new mainline Pokémon game, I remember many – myself included – excused the game’s faults. I attributed the exclusion of hundreds of Pokémon, some textures and animations straight out of the GameCube era, and an absurd, unfinished narrative to Game Freak’s lack of experience designing a fully 3D, semi-open world. Surely, I thought, one of the most renowned gaming series in history would get it right next time. And to some extent they did with Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I still consider it the best Pokémon game since Black 2 and White 2.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.\nCountless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”\nHere’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.\nThere have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.\nRead more",

An AI could probably replicate my writing style quite thoroughly, because there are at present many thousands of my - mine, my own - words on the internet, and they and everything else have and are being scraped by AI. This thought process is as a result of a few AI things intersecting with my workspace at once recently. Several of them are quite funny, and also not.

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you loved Journey's shimmering deserts and fluid sand-surfing, then let me draw your attention to the newly announced Sword Of The Sea. Revealed during Sony's PlayStation Showcase, Sword Of The Sea comes from Giant Squid Studio, the folks behind 2016's Abzû and 2020's The Pathless, and sees you play as The Wraith, a lone explorer on a quest to restore submerged cities that have been buried beneath a sea of golden dunes. You're able to slickly travel across the sandy terrain thanks to a rad-as-heck hoversword, a traversal tool that's described on the PlayStation blog as a \"snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one.\" You can witness some major sand-shredding and see what else Sword Of The Sea has in store by watching the lavish announcement trailer below.\nRead more",

In fact, I’ve had about as much fun with it as I would on a spa day in the Barad-dûr sulfur pits. Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.\nIn my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on. Graphics card allowing, obviously.\nRead more",

Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.\nBased on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.\nRead more",

If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.\nWhile the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.\nRead more",

          "description": "After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). \nI'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's no secret that Sony have been making increasing efforts to bring their exclusive PlayStation games to PC over the last couple of years, but one thing they've never quite been clear about is when we can expect to see them. They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. \nAccording to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only \"acceptable\" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now. \nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said he thinks \"Maybe it's time we removed the numbers\" from Final Fantasy games. In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. \"Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'\" he said, and removing them is \"something that I've discussed with the higher-ups\". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely. As long as they don't pull a Mortal Kombat and go back to 1, though, we're good. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last july I was given the opportunity to play an early beta for Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer shooter that pits you and a bunch of your mech suit-wearing buddies against unstoppable raptor hordes. In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.\r\n\n\r\nIt was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "For the last six years, my Skyrim wood elf has been stuck in some godforsaken cave in goodness knows what corner of Tamriel. I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.\nWorse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.\nRead more",

SCS Software this week shared screenshots of their new Santa Cruz, which has been \"revamped from the ground up\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

But Kujlevka's great strength is its levity. While not particularly funny, its consistent wry humour perfectly counterbalances all the talk of political chaos, existential futility, and petty greed. Its opening should have been a clue, really, considering you hang out with skeletons while drinking and commenting on the food on a train in outer space.\nRead more",

But my affection for George Lucas' brain-baby is less about the stories and characters, and more about the general vibe of the galaxy itself. I love its retro-futurist junkpunk style, the rusty spaceships, dusty planets, and fusty aliens. That's why I've more fondness for games like Dark Forces and KotOR than any of the films or TV shows, as they let me poke around locations like Tatooine and Ord Mantell at my own pace.\r\n\n\r\nHence, the idea of being properly, immerse in Star Wars, to be physically surrounded by it and able to touch it, is probably my ultimate VR fantasy. Sod the imaginatively inert virtual spaces of Horizon Worlds, if Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to sell the Metaverse to me, he'd build the whole thing out in Mos Eisely chic, and let me run my own virtual cantina selling NFT space-drinks to legless bounty hunters and idiot Web3 prospectors.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Man who Laughs\nBandai Namco has revealed yet another veteran fighter headed to the roster of its upcoming sequel, Tekken 8 — And following on from the fun 'n' games of Lili Rochefort and Asuka Kazama, this newest trailer brings a whole lot more darkness, fear, and pain, with the return of psychopathic mercenary Bryan Fury!\nMaking his debut in 1997's Tekken 3, Bryan Fury is a former Hong Kong Interpol agent who was killed in a shootout, also involving celebrated detective Lei Wu-Long. Fury's corpse was rushed to the laboratory of the moral-free Dr. Abel, who wished to experiment on reanimated bodies for the purpose of future warfare. Now essentially a reanimated half-cyborg, Bryan's mind is all but completely lost, creating a sociopathic weapon capable of incredible destruction without as much as a raised eyebrow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0cwK2V4og\nFury's new trailer reveals that our favourite zombie's hard-hunting punches and trademark backfists are in full effect, along with his capabilities for superhuman feats of strength, defying the power of his Actually Alive brethren. Of course, Fury's penchant for maniacal laughter rings through the entire trailer, because if you can't have a good ol' chuckle when you're dead, when can you?\nBryan Fury's trailer was, unfortunately, leaked a little ahead of schedule, upsetting Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada. But the preview finally got its official debut at the climax of this weekend's Combo Breaker tournament in Illinois, where the madman's return was welcome by the Tekken faithful.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, Leroy Smith, Lili Rochefort, and Hwoarang.\nThe post The maniacal Bryan Fury is next to join the Tekken 8 roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I didn't hear no bell...\nEvery fighting game franchise owes an unpayable debt to Street Fighter.\nOh, sure, Street Fighter wasn't the first slugger on the block, and we can tip our hats to forerunners such as Technos' Karate Champ and Irem's Yie Are Kung Fu for pioneering the genre itself. But, inarguably, it was the 1991 arrival of Capcom's Street Fighter II that truly popularised the one-on-one fighter on a global basis, reinventing competitive gaming, garnering millions of sales in the arcade and home market, and galvanizing itself as one of the premier franchises in history.\nStreet Fighter II wrote the blueprint that would be followed by every franchise eager to raise fists and feet in its wake.

Even as a fan of Nightdive Studio’s work on game preservation, I wasn’t sure they could pull it off. Normally, their approach is to simply port games to modern hardware, sometimes fully transplanting them to their Kex Engine. Fully remaking a game, though? Hm.\nIt’s not that System Shock isn’t in need of a remake, either. Much like many PC games of its time, it’s extremely unfriendly. It’s not necessarily a difficult game, but the learning curve isn’t just steep; it’s also covered in dish soap and broken glass. Even Nightdive’s previous System Shock: Enhanced Edition doesn’t really manage to soften its disposition.\nHowever, System Shock’s obtuse systems also served a greater purpose. Even today, …",

However, it won't be available to all-komers, nor will you won't be able to download it straight away.\nHow to gain access to the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test\n[caption id=\"attachment_382319\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nInterested parties cannot sign up for the Stress Test via their PlayStation or Xbox consoles. Instead, you'll need to go to WB Games' website on your PC to perform this task. Log in to your WB Games Account or create a new one. After signing in, you'll be given the opportunity to select an Xbox Series X/S or PS5 code. If you're selected, a code should be emailed to you.\nYes, the beta will not be available on PC or the Nintendo Switch. It makes sense as both of these versions are being developed by separate studios QLOC, Shiver Entertainment, and Saber Interactive. Thankfully, you won't need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold subscription in order to take part in the test.\nIs the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test a beta?\nPublisher WB Games has said this stress test shouldn't be considered a beta. \"The purpose is to deliberately stress our online infrastructure and identify potential issues ahead of the game’s launch,\" said WB Games in an official Q&A. \"The test is also unrelated to the Mortal Kombat 1 Pre-Order Beta that has been announced for August 2023.\"\nIf you don't want to play Mortal Kombat 1 until it's fully released, you'll have to wait until September 19. You can test your might on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store). A PS4 and Xbox One release is not currently scheduled. If you want to get back into Mortal Kombat earlier than that, the prior entry is available on Xbox Game Pass\nThe post How to sign up for Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's a new method to easily acquire legendary shards in Destiny 2, and odds are it'll be gone before the weekend.\nWant to get infinite shards in Destiny 2? Well, then this is what you have to do\nMeet up with Ikora at The Tower, and take one of the exotic quests. Any will do the trick, so maybe get the first one.\nFollow the quest steps until the fourth step. No more, no less.\nHead back toward Ikora, talk to her, then get away from her without taking the armor.\nOpen the menu and chose to abandon the quest.\nTalk to her again, and congrats, you'll now be able to take infinite pieces of exotic armor.\nNow you just have to dismantle the exotic pieces of armor until you get tired of being rich or Bungie fixes the leaky golden fountain.\nYou'll get legendary shards each time you dismantle something, and you can keep doing it constantly. Youtuber Divide managed to blow this wide open, and you can watch their tutorial on how to use the glitch below:\nhttps://youtu.be/x5KDoBoUh9Y\nBungie will surely make short work of this bug very soon, so we highly recommend you check out this sweet early summer gift as soon as you can.\n[Update: Some players are reporting that there was a quick server-side fix that kicked them out of the game at roughly 6PM ET.

Multiple upcoming games were revealed in the developer's game showcase yesterday, including a new Daemon X Machina game and two new entries in the Story of Seasons franchise. Rune Factory is also doubling up in development as Series Director Shiro Maekawa revealed the company is diligently working on two new titles in the series, Rune Factory Project Dragon and Rune Factory 6.\nProject Dragon seems to be the one further along in development, as Maekawa provided the first footage of this Rune Factory spin-off. The game is going with a Japanese-styled world as players will explore the \"Land of the East\" for the very first time. And it looks like they'll be able to do it while riding Tatsu dragons.\nhttps://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=1185\nIt feels like a lot of franchises have been looking to ancient Japan for inspiration over the past few years, from Monster Hunter Rise to the upcoming Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless. To me, that's a good thing. I haven't been able to get enough of the setting since playing Ghost of Tsushima. What little video we see of the new game in the showcase certainly looks alright to me and I look forward to finding out more info (and whether or not the protagonist will have amnesia again.)\nBeyond Project Dragon, Maekawa also confirmed Rune Factory 6 is in development. This game will feature a traditional western-fantasy setting on the continent of Adonea. I can only hope the end product is a few ticks above what we got with Rune Factory 5.\nAs with most of the games in the showcase, there is no information on a release date or potential launch platforms. In the meantime, Marvelous and Xseed Games will release Rune Factory 3 Special in September.\nThe post Rune Factory: Project Dragon is going big and bold with its eastern take on the franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Because doing chores alone is dull\nThe Story of Seasons series continues to be the breadwinner for the developers at Marvelous, so it's never a surprise when there is one in development. During the Marvelous Game Showcase, we got our first look at the new Story of Seasons title. The theme of the game, according to series manager Hikaru Nakano, will be \"Experiences.\" There wasn't much footage of it in the showcase, but what was there showed the team is working hard on its visuals. While I thought Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town looked just fine, I think the direction the team is going with the new game is sharp.\nhttps://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=892\nInformation on the new Story of Seasons is still scarce, but that didn't stop Nakano from announcing a future series entry during the stream. This also-unnamed Story of Seasons title is being developed around the theme of \"a Story of Seasons you can play with everyone.\" As the series has mostly been a solitary experience throughout its life, it'll be interesting to see how Marvelous implements the concept. I have to wonder if the wild success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which made playing with friends easier than ever before, pushed Nakano in this direction.\nIf I had to put any money on it, I'd wager we'll be seeing more of the first new Story of Seasons game sometime in early 2024. I am curious about what platforms the game will release on as Nakano said it will \"...reach more players than ever before.\" That sounds like code for a mobile game to me, but it could be a cross-platform experience along the lines of Genshin Impact.\nAs for the multiplayer entry, one can only guess when it'll release and for what platforms. Both games are \"diligently under development,\" according to the showcase. If you can't wait that long, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life releases next month.\nThe post There are two Story of Seasons games in development, and one of them is going multiplayer appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new patch, which is available to download today, fixes a few issues that had been bothering some players on their adventures through the Sky Islands.\nUnfortunately, as noted by Twitter user OatmealDome, Version 1.1.2 is mostly focused on eradicating Duplication glitches, with attempts to shutdown exploit bugs in which players could forge multiple versions of some of the title's top-tier weaponry. So it looks like the party's over for you multiple Master Sword wielders.\nAccording to the official patch notes, available on the official Nintendo website, the update also fixes a strange, sporadic bug that would cause sound effects to randomly play at an extremely high volume. This has never happened to me but it sounds pretty funny. Additionally, the patch fixes a bug that caused players to become stuck during the mission \"Camera Work in the Depths\". This bug should be rectified.\nFinally, the patch has addressed general issues to \"improve the gameplay experience.\"\nDon't ask questions I guess. Still, at least the sound of Ultrahand won't blow your eardrums anymore.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post New update brings an end to Tears of the Kingdom duplication chicanery appeared first on Destructoid.",

The casting sees Rudolph reunited with fellow Sabrina alumni Tati Gabrielle, who is expected to receive the role of Kitana's best friend and confidant, Jade. Rudolph seems a solid choice for Kitana, carrying the sly grace, strong presence, and timeless beauty of the deadly-but-honorable, noblewoman.\nThe success of New Line's original Mortal Kombat movie, directed by Simon McQuoid and starring martial arts actors Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada, has clearly allowed the new production to produce a sequel with a little more ambition and star power. The Boys' Karl Urban is tipped to play Tinseltown star Johnny Cage, and there are still all manner of potential roles to be filled, ahead of preliminary shooting this summer. McQuoid will return to direct, given his continued enthusiasm for the brand and project.\nMortal Kombat 2 is not to be confused with Mortal Kombat II.

There were some highlights to the show, but the only stream I've been focused on this year is the Marvelous Game Showcase. Marvelous and Xseed Games are one of my favorite developer/publisher combos out there, so when they have new games to announce, I pay attention. And I'm glad I was paying attention to the stream today because Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion capped off the showcase.\nhttps://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=1693\nOkay, so it's one of those terrible pre-rendered teaser trailers that I usually make fun of. But at least this game is happening. And why shouldn't it? According to Marvelous, Daemon X Machina sold \"very well\" on Nintendo Switch. While work on a sequel was confirmed back in 2021, the Marvelous Game Showcase was our first sorta-look at the title. A supplementary email that was sent out after the presentation didn't provide any extra information other than to say more details will be made available at a later date.\nIf you've never heard of Daemon X Machina, the game is a wonderful experimental mech action game with outstanding gameplay bookended by a story you'll likely forget about the moment you set down the controller. Even if it wasn't my favorite game of 2019, it was one I came back to often because I could always rely on it for a good time.\nDaemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is now in development at Marvelous First Studio.\nThe post Daemon X Machina is getting a sequel and I am here for it appeared first on Destructoid.",

The return to Derceto Manor will arrive on October 25, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nAnnounced during a spotlight on the game, Alone in the Dark will go for $59.99. And if you want to check it out before you put that cash down, there's also a free playable prologue going live tonight. It's up on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.\nTHQ Nordic says that this prologue doesn't have spoilers for the main story, but will let you experience what this reimagining of an old classic has to offer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJekekI4Vkg\nStar power\nAdditionally, THQ Nordic has announced that Alone in the Dark will feature two recognizable likenesses for its leads. Pieces Interactive is working with David Harbour (Stranger Things) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) for their portrayals of Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood, respectively.\nThe actors are lending their voice, appearance, and acting to the protagonists. Each is a selectable character, and depending on who you play as, you'll get a different view of the Alone in the Dark story. And this marks another game crossover for Harbour, who's also set to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie. They aren't directly connected, but in my own head-canon, I like to think they are.\nFor those who like a little bit of scares around the Halloween season, October is starting to look stacked. Alongside Alone in the Dark, we also recently got an October release date for Alan Wake 2.\nAs for Alone in the Dark, this reboot of the Infogrames classic certainly has a long legacy to live up to. The team is calling it a love letter to the '90s classic, so we'll see if it captures the magic again in October.\nThe post Alone in the Dark remake arrives in October, and a playable prologue is out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The October 2022 announcement of Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive streaming series from Genvid Entertainment and Konami, raised some eyebrows from fans but provided little in the way of details. Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.\nIn this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.\nSilent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. \nSilent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year. If this unique concept has piqued your interest, you can check out the reveal trailer below.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. \nI also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? \n“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. \n“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”\nLike Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

Instead of full transformation like the previous G1-style incarnation, this new collectible is built as a display piece that can shift between various aerial action poses, speak lines of dialogue, and respond to voice and app commands from your phone or other device.\nThe figure features 21 precision servo motors and 69 microchips. Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.\nThe team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.\nThe new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899).

There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. \n“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

But I was also given an exclusive tour of FFXVI’s endgame and other supplementary content by creative director Hiroshi Takai and combat director Ryota Suzuki. \nIt’s safe to say there’s plenty to play, especially if you enjoy chasing numbers in combat. \n\nFFXVI features an Arcade Mode, allowing players to run through stages they’ve already completed, this time with an on-screen score calculator and combat grader. But a New Game+ playthrough opens up two additional versions, and both are more difficult than the game’s base Story Mode and Action Mode difficulties. It’s important to note you can play through New Game+ on one of these base difficulties if you’d like, but you’re missing …",

          "description": "The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion, Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved, arrives next month. As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.\nThis second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.\nYou can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.\n\nI was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.\nIn addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9.

Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. \nThis hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure.

And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. \nWhile the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. \n“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs.

          "description": "Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. \nNavigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.\n\nEach of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAnd, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nDays of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.",

          "description": "One of the biggest 2023 PlayStation Showcase announcements was a confirmation of the long-rumored remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.\nThe single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, \"Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5,\" with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.\nUpdate: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on the page.\nMetal Gear\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake\nMetal Gear Solid (Including VR Missions/Special Missions)\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (HD Collection version)\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (HD Collection version)",

The trailer shows protagonist Basim as he leaps, slides, and fights his way across the ancient streets of Baghdad.\nBasim was introduced to Assassin’s Creed players in the earlier release of Valhalla, but this new game jumps back to an earlier time in the character’s life.\n\n\nThe action on display looks slick and modern but strongly calls to mind the flow of gameplay that longtime players may recall from early games in the series, controlling the likes of Altair and Ezio as they moved through large urban cityscapes. The new combat system, in particular, features some especially impressive animations and combat moves. The trailer also suggests that players will have a number of choices in how to approach a given mission, with clear decisions outlined in pre-mission briefings and then the chance to execute on a chosen plan.\nAssassin’s Creed Mirage is targeting release on October 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC.",

But it did answer an all-important one: when the game is coming out. \n\n\nHere's what we gathered: Alan is trapped ... somewhere. According to him, he has to write to escape. Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. \nThe trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. \nAlan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer.

That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.\nIn the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.\nSword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.",

While seeing Venom emerge from the shadows was extremely exciting, the bulk of the trailer showcased Peter Parker and Miles Morales working side by side to take down several goons in the streets of New York.\nThat in itself was merely an eyebrow-raising affair, but it's hardly confirmation of cooperative play. However, when Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter responded to a SacAnime panel question about whether or not Spider-Man 2 is a co-op game or not with, \"I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so,\" that added fuel to the fire. \nYesterday, when a Twitter user asked if the speculation and rumors were true, Insomniac Games unexpectedly jumped in to clear the air. \"Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!,\" the tweet from the official Insomniac Games account said. This seems to fully debunk the speculation from fans and comments from Jeter, and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will follow in the footsteps of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales in being a fully single-player experience.\nNope! It is an epic single-player adventure!\nMay 22, 2023\nThis isn't the first time a Spider-Man 2 voice actor has seemingly confirmed details about the game without the permission of the studio or PR team. Back in March, Venom voice actor Tony Todd announced to the world through his Twitter account that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is expected to launch in September of this year, with commercials starting to appear in August. While we are still waiting to see if that pans out better than Jeter's comments about co-op, Todd has since deleted the original tweet. \nWith a PlayStation Showcase set to air tomorrow, we might not have long to wait to learn more. For now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 later this year.\n[via IGN]",

Year after year, generation after generation, Nintendo's crack team of developers releases consistently great entries that are almost always Game of the Year contenders. \nFor the purpose of remaining focused on the core entries of The Legend of Zelda franchise, several spin-offs and obscure titles are omitted. Titles like Hyrule Warriors, Link's Crossbow Training, Cadence of Hyrule, and the CD-i games are left off. Even with those missing, we still have 21 games where Link battles the forces of evil to save Zelda, Hyrule, or whatever equivalent exists in that respective game. Since the series has been running for more than three decades, we must consider both legacy and impact, as well as how much fun the games are to play …",

          "description": "Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI, players have asked about a potential PC version of the game, especially given that the PlayStation 5-exclusivity reveal came with a six-month window. Some potential players have assumed when that window is up, a PC version of FFXVI will be released. \nDuring my FFXVI cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida about a PC version of the game. While it sounds like it’s on the way, he stresses that it will be longer than six months before players see or even possibly hear about it. I’m guessing he mentions six months because of the aforementioned exclusivity window, but he reiterates that this window expiring does not mean the PC version of FFXVI will go live then or anytime soon. \nSo for now, and presumably quite a while after the game’s release, if you want to play FFXVI, you’ll need a PlayStation 5. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

With the former, CBUIII gets to create settings and characters they can easily return to in future patch quests, expansions, and more. But theoretically, that’s not the case with the latter – Clive Rosfield’s story wraps up in Final Fantasy XVI. \nAnd right now, that indeed could be the end of Clive and the rest of Valisthea’s story because currently, CBUIII has no plans for FFXVI DLC, according to director Hiroshi Takai.

As teased yesterday, Miles Morales and Miguel O'Hara (AKA Spider-Man 2099) are joining Fortnite in promotion of the highly anticipated film.\nThe new additions, which include reskinned Spider-Man's Web-Shooters – now called Spider-Verse Web-Shooters – and two new Outfits, accompany Spider-Man themed Week 11 Quests. Epic Games teases that the Web-Shooters, in particular, will come in handy in those Quests. While most of those Quests award XP, one will give you the \"Silk & Cologne (EI8HT version)\" lobby track from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\nIf this sounds up your alley, you can find the Spider-Verse Web-Shooters on the ground or by exchanging bars for them from Spider-Gwen. You can also find the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) Outfit, which includes the masked Earth 1610 alt style and the Spider-Verse Portal Back Bling, as well as the Spider-Man 2099 Outfit, which includes the 2099 Web Cape Back Bling, in the Item Shop. These items, along with other accessories, can be purchased as part of the Across the Spider-Verse Bundle. That bundle includes the Mega City Swing Loading Screen.\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse arrives in theaters on June 2.",

For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now!
