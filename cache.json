Nevertheless, the option is conspicuously absent in Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. What it does boast, though — unusually for a niche Japanese release — is a top-to-bottom English language translation, which makes this a more tempting import for shoot-'em-up fans.\nWe admit to having no knowledge of the Manga on which the game is based, but its manifestation as a colourful bullet hell escapade is nonetheless appealing. This is a game as much for anime aficionados as it is hardcore gamers, littered with illustrations, fetching menus, and plenty of fan service. Clothes partly tear off when a character’s life bar diminishes: a translucent, semi-naked girl flashing over the action to inform you of danger; while elsewhere, risqué galleries are furnished by collecting in-game picture pieces.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The results from those entries have now been published and are well worth a read; there were some interesting - if not necessarily surprising - results.\nWe were particularly interested in the Nintendo Switch Online section, with the backdrop that Nintendo confirmed the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pack for the Expansion Pack during the survey process. For starters 88.9% of respondents confirmed they have the standard NSO subscription, which is unsurprising as it's a requirement for online play (and cloud saves). Over a third of people take advantage of the family membership, with over 55% of those doing that with a group that includes friends and 'others', enabling users to have access at a low price.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Every day you wake up, leave your apartment and hit the streets, chatting to the locals, picking up a bit of info, even gambling a bit. The folks you meet are from the shadier side of society and they'll hire you for jobs. Sometimes it’s simple burglary, sometimes it's breaking a vase, or snatching a specific bit of loot. There’s even a guy who keeps trying to offer me wet work! It all boils down to the same thing though: sneaking around some rich guy’s place, disabling the security, avoiding or taking down the occupants, and getting out without being caught. Afterwards, I fence the loot and head to bed.\nIt's all building up to Abermore's central heist: The Feast of the Lucky Few. It's also my only chance to rescue the famous Hanged Man, a dame I met on the boat over here. They're the thief of thieves! A living legend! But the tyrant king grabbed her before we got ashore and she’ll be executed in eighteen days if I don’t break her out. That’s eighteen nights to prepare, eighteen jobs to build the resources, the connections I need for the heist of a life time. A terrible shame, then, that alarm bells started ringing almost as soon as I started playing.\nRead more",

They both specialise in the placement and movement of boxes, and they both share the same cheery disposition. Sure, Patrick may not have the same pointy nose or cheeky smile of his mate Wilmot, but the way his eyes rove from side to side as he wiggles to the beat of Priscilla Snow's meditative and upbeat electronic soundtrack is surely a sign of someone who is truly in love with what they do. \nIf anything, I reckon Wilmot would be a wee bit jealous of Patrick. You see, in Patrick's line of work, his cubes contain multitudes, to misquote that famous Walt Whitman line. As long as they're resting against a hard surface, cubes can be packed into other cubes in Patrick's Parabox like a stack of matryoshka dolls. They can also be unpacked in the same way, allowing him to navigate the tight constraints of his respective puzzle arenas with surprising dexterity. It's like he's discovered the TARDIS of sokoban-style cube-pushing, if you will, and cor, just imagine what Wilmot could do with such technology. That warehouse would be immaculate. \nRead more",

They are, after all, the reason its ludicrous scale is workable at all beyond the opening hours, and a major reason its predecessor was so interesting and forward-thinking to begin with. But they are also a source of great friction and confusion, especially if you don't take the time to learn how they actually work.\nDistant Worlds 2 is, ultimately, a game that you need to meet in the middle.

I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. \nYou can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can be devastatingly powerful. \nRead more",

As long as there is food, more buggos will come, and as long as there are buggos, they will loosely move in the direction you command, dying in droves but succeeding in aggregate.

Nate delivers a fun Cavern Of Lies where we have to guess which of the plots of terrible ghost games are made up. And for some reason I've written 'The Count of Monster Disco' in my notes.

          "description": "As several members of the RPS Treehouse can attest, I have not been able to stop playing Tunic this week. I was a little cautious going in, having not particularly gelled with the E3 demo from last year, but in hindsight, that early glimpse was nothing but the tip of a tiny fox nose peeking out of its burrow. In its full, regal splendour, Tunic has become an early game of the contender for me, and a large part of that is down to its wonderfully clever in-game instruction manual.\nWhen Imogen (RPS in peace) interviewed Tunic dev Andrew Shouldice last September, they talked about how instruction manuals were a fundamental part of a game's design back in the days of the NES, and at one point he even pulled out his old instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link to demonstrate some of the \"tantalising hints\" they'd offer to curious players. As Brendan (also RPS in peace) noted in our Tunic review, the in-game manual is indeed a critical part of what makes Tunic special, and the act of piecing it together page by page really does capture that feeling of discovering some great secret that only you and the dev team know about. But here's a secret between you and me: it's not by chance Shouldice pulled out that old Zelda II manual during our interview last year. His fox hero may be cut from the same cloth as Nintendo's green sword-swinger, but the art inside Tunic's instruction manual also pays a wonderful tribute to those Zelda booklets of yore, too. \nRead more",

At this stage I’m less of a worthy Tarnished warrior on their way to be crowned the Elden Lord and instead more of a Mr. Bean type, accidentally succeeding through sheer incompetence alone. I can’t explain it, but my method of defeating Godrick had the same energy as Bean making a sandwich, in that I think the game eventually just took pity on me and let me win the fight to save me any further embarrasment.\r\n\n\r\nI’m coming to terms with the fact I may never finish Elden Ring. I'm only in the second proper area, but I'm finding encounters to require a level of patience I simply don't possess. Its boss fights are simply too hard. But if I’m struggling this much at such an early stage, what else could Elden Ring possibly have to offer? What types of monstrosities lurk in the farthest reaches of the Lands Between, and how difficult are they to defeat? Spoilers, naturally, below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As for 3D platformers, Super Mario 64 remains a glowing example of how movement makes exploration joyful. String together rolls and jumps and you're not just navigating a world, but bounding through it like a gymnast (who's also a part time plumber to help pay the costs of serious competition).\nElden Ring is a terrible platformer. It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast. But this is what makes its platforming sections good. They force you to embrace your limited toolset and channel your amateur longjumping, golfing, and climbing skills you definitely don't have.\nRead more",

This story trailer is a bit of a tease, in that it doesn't really de-mystify any of the elements of the game that I found most mystifying in my earlier preview, but it definitely does give you a flavour of the kind of adventures and quick-fixes you get into as Vix the space mechanic. Plus it shows off some of the cooler visual flair FixFox has (especially in its loading screens). Give it a watch after the cut.\nRead more",

One thing I failed to mention, though, was Roach, Geralt's horse.\nI'm sure Roach has a great personality, I'm sure he's very kind. But from a purely professional standpoint, I can't stand him. He's hardly smooth in the stirrups, nor can he really climb anything substantial. That's why I'd like Roach swapped out for Elden Ring's Torrent, a horse-goat that corners like Colin McCrae and double jumps like Super Mario.

The whole conversation I had with these two dudes was over 40 minutes long. So much of interviews gets discarded (like tears in rain etc) and the process of distilling it all down to a few quotes can be, to put it succinctly, a pain in the hole.

Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is.

          "description": "Microsoft recently announced that they’d cracked how to get Game Pass games running on the handheld Steam Deck. Great! It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.\r\n\n\r\nAfter having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all. Still, a beta is a beta, and there are very much some kinks to work out.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The update's split into two halves, with one focused on providing new content, and the other full of changes to try to improve the game based on player feedback.

For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. \nIt's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting? I feel a great disturbance in the Force.  \nRead more",

          "description": "Many creators leave fingerprints on their games, but few apply their digits as physically as Shinji Mikami in Ghostwire: Tokyo. One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. \nWhile I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.\nRead more",

With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. \nIf you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay?

It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.\nRead more",

Let's embrace Chaos.\nStranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes.

Combat is elegant and the story seems refined, not bloated, which makes this a ronin romp worth watching out for.\nRead more",

I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat.

Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).\r\n\n\r\nFSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.\nYou see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A big new patch hit Elden Ring today, adding new content while fixing and tweaking some of the old. The new NPC is named Jar-Bairn and goodness me, what could be cuter than a wee pot pal? The update has also added new quest steps for several existing NPCs. On top of that, the patch brings bug fixes, buffs for many sorceries, and other tweaks and bits.\nRead more",

          "description": "In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to \"a niche of freaks\". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.\nWhen I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. \"It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away,\" he says. \"Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you.\"\nRead more",

Many games pay their respects to the blonde lawn mower and his absentee princess, but few have such fondness and understanding of the exact feelings those adventures conjure up, the precise sensation of exploring, the nook-scavenging, and the meticulous internal mapping that happens when you play Zelda's brand of wundergame. Tunic might have sacrificed some of its own identity in hitting every Ocarina note so perfectly, but when the result is such a capable homage it's hard to complain.\nRead more",

So far, a cinematic trailer has established the atmosphere for the scares to come, and now we know that Academy Award-nominated actress Jessie Buckley will star in the game.\nBuckley will lend her voice and likeness to the game’s protagonist, Kate Wilder. The actress’ film credits include The Lost Daughter (which earned her an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress at the 2022 Academy Awards), Wild Rose, and Judy. She’s also had notable TV roles on series such as Fargo and Chernobyl. \nGet ready for an unforgettable stay…\n#TheDarkPictures pic.twitter.com/6SbcxDXRzR\nMarch 28, 2022\nThe Devil In Me follows a documentary film crew that gets invited to explore a replica of the home of America’s first serial killer, H.H. Holmes. While exploring the ominously named “Murder Castle,” things quickly take a turn for the worse as the crew is stalked by a dangerous figure. \nThe Devil In Me ostensibly launches this year given the yearly release cadence of previous Dark Pictures games but Supermassive has not confirmed a release window.  It will serve as the finale of the first season of the Anthology. It was assumed that the final four entries in the planned eight-game series would make up Season 2; however, Supermassive recently trademarked the titles of five more games, bringing the total number to 10. \nSupermassive has a busy 2022 ahead because it also has the summer camp slasher horror game The Quarry hitting this June. The studio deems this star-studded title as a spiritual successor to Until Dawn. You can learn more about what that The Quarry entails here.",

What’s odd is that 2K, the publisher behind BioShock Infinite, hasn’t really publicly acknowledged these updates. On top of that, there’s no confirmed reasoning behind them either as BioShock Infinite remains the same game it was before the updates started happening. \nAccording to TheGamer, it received seven updates in 2021 and now, in March alone, it’s had 13. Players have begun speculating about what these updates mean, and why they’re happening, and some have arrived at a possible remaster of BioShock Infinite, or a new-gen update (which could theoretically affect the PC version). Others think that perhaps 2K is working on some back-end stuff to make BioShock Infinite a Steam Deck-ready game. \nHowever, what seems most likely is some behind-the-scenes work on 2K launch integration, as pointed out by LitheBeep on Reddit. Zorklis on Reddit, in response, said one of the updates features “2K Launcher Development Branch” in it, seemingly confirming that the updates have to do with this launcher and not anything more exciting like a remaster or new-gen update. Perhaps 2K will end the speculation by letting everyone know what’s going on with BioShock Infinite. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s BioShock Infinite review and then listen to Game Informer’s Video Gameography crew dive deep into the history of BioShock.

          "description": "Russia openly attacked and invaded Ukraine on February 24 after weeks of mounting tensions between the two countries, with hundreds of Ukrainian citizens reportedly killed by bombings and Russian militia as a result. As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross. Many of these efforts have come from studios within the video game industry, some in the form of charity drives, others with public displays of support for Ukraine. \nGame Informer will continue to update this story. \nFortnite\nEpic Games announced that from March 20 through April 3, all proceeds from its popular battle royale, Fortnite, would be donated to humanitarian relief for people aff…",

          "description": "Now that season 4 of Video Gameography is complete, and the Uncharted series has been, well...charted, it's off to new frontiers and fresh faces. After saying farewell to co-host Ben Reeves in the last episode, we welcome GI Associate Editor John Carson to the podcast as the new co-host alongside the ever-present Marcus Stewart. Along with a series of guests, season 5 of Video Gameography will be an exploration and examination of 2K's Bioshock franchise.\nSo, we cordially ask, would you kindly follow us into the depths of the sea? We're headed to the city of Rapture, made by and for movers and shakers, unbound by the expectations and judgments of the surface world.\nDeveloped by Irrational Games (AKA 2K Boston) and released in 2007, Bioshock reimagined and redefined what a modern shooter could be. In this episode, we explore the origins of the series stemming from the commercial failures of the well-loved PC franchise System Shock and the turbulent development cycle in which Bioshock triumphantly succeeded in spite of. We discuss director Ken Levine's inspirations of Rapture and its inhabitants like the industrial mastermind Andrew Ryan, the Big Daddies, Little Sisters, and much more.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc (@LeBlancWes) as we unpack the history and narrative of the first Bioshock! \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

That means even fans who played previous Lego Star Wars titles won't be getting the same games they finished years ago. Although the development wasn't without significant bumps in the road, we look forward to seeing how it all comes together when Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga launches on April 5.\nFor more on the game, you can read TT Games explain how The Skywalker Saga feels like one cohesive galaxy and how it will receive post-launch DLC based on The Mandalorian.",

Despite being produced by Showtime, the live-action adaptation of Halo can only be found on the Paramount+ streaming service.\nIf you're new to Paramount+ and haven't had a subscription on file, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial and squeeze in the first episode, and maybe the second if you're quick enough when it releases next Thursday. Otherwise, a full-blown membership will run as low as $4.99 a month for an ad-supported plan or $49.99 for an entire year which saves $10 if you're okay with paying for the subscription upfront. You can sign up for the trial or subscription on the Paramount+ website. The app can be downloaded on a variety of smart devices, including the most brand synergistic way to watch Halo, on your Xbox. If you're a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you can snag a 30-day trial for Paramount+ thanks to membership perks available right now.\nIf this week's premiere episode is any indication, new episodes of Halo will go live on Paramount+ every Thursday at 2 a.m. Central. The series is scheduled to run for nine episodes; however, a second season has already been greenlit and will likely enter production sometime in the future.\nHalo stars Pablo Schreiber as John–117, AKA Master Chief, Jen Taylor as Cortana, and Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey.",

One of its biggest titles is the strategy RPG Dungeon Boss, and the talent there consists of veterans that worked on games such as Halo Wars, Age of Empires, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Netflix has not revealed how much it paid for the studio.\nSince last September, Netflix has been gradually scooping up game developers to bolster its presence in the video game market. Earlier this month, it purchased Finnish mobile developer Next Games for $72 million. Netflix’s acquisition of Oxenfree developer Night School stands as its most noteworthy purchase so far. The team behind Afterparty is currently developing Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. You can read more about what the future holds for Night School in our interview with the studio’s director. \nIn addition to spreading its IP into the game industry, Netflix has a plethora of video game adaptations in the pipeline.

If successful, you'll likely have all kinds of new weapons and tools to bring into upcoming matches and experience gains to boot.

A small number of images have given fans brief glimpses at different setpieces, but a recent leak revealed brothers Sam and Henry. \nNew HBO's The Last of Us set photos in Calgary!\n#TheLastofUs #HBO pic.twitter.com/9OObMY4JXk\nMarch 23, 2022\nAs reported by Eurogamer, images and a short video clip were uploaded to Twitter showing Sam, Henry, Ellie, and Joel in garb similar to their in-game counterparts (see images above). The actors playing the brothers remain unknown, but The Mandalorian's Pedro Pascal is portraying Joel, and Game of Throne's Bella Ramsey stars as Ellie. Ramsey is even wearing the young heroine's iconic hoodie and winter jacket.\nThe clip, seen below, shows the four jogging across a street in some downtown metropolis. They crouch/take cover near a car (except for Joel, of course, he's too badass to hide). Then the crew disappears into a building. Where they're going is a mystery, but if the television show is following the series of events that take place in Naughty Dog's acclaimed title, the journey will be harrowing to say the least. \nNew video of Joel, Ellie, Henry and Sam on the set of #TheLastofUs!\npic.twitter.com/XpwDzND0hz\nMarch 23, 2022\nHBO’s The Last of Us is slated to drop in 2023 and is brimming with talent including the previously mentioned Pascal and Ramsey. Anna Torv (Mindhunter), Nico Parker (Dumbo), Merle Dandridge (The Last Of Us video games), and Gabriel Luna (Terminator: Dark Fate) are also cast members. Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann (lead writer and creative director on the game) are helming the show.\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

There are returning faces like Bigby Wolf and Snow White, and some new ones, too. However, if you haven’t played the game, it sounds like you’ll still be able to enjoy its sequel because in a new interview with Edge magazine, Telltale CEO Jamie Ottilie said the first episode will get players up to speed on the characters, as reported by IGN. \n“We strive to design our narratives so they can stand on their own,” Ottilie told Edge, citing that despite that, he hopes players jump into the first game to experience it before the second. \nHowever, if players don’t, they’ll still be prepared for the sequel by the end of its first episode because Ottilie thinks “the opening of the first episode sets things up in such a way that the player understands how the characters got where they are now.” \nWe’ll all be caught up after playing episode one sometime in 2023. For now, read Game Informer’s extensive breakdown of the resurrection and reinvention of Telltale Games, which covers the studio’s shutdown, its subsequent reopening, its new development on The Wolf Among Us 2 and its The Expanse game, and more. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited for The Wolf Among Us 2?

As spotted by Venture Beat, Cal Kestis’ lightsaber hilt will soon be available to purchase, thanks to it winning a 2020 fan poll for requested legacy lightsabers. \nBeginning March 25, you can buy Cal’s legacy lightsaber hilt at Dok-Ondar’s Den of Antiquities. It sports the signature damaged base but comes with a dual lightsaber adapter. That means you can make it a double-bladed sword should you buy a second hilt. You can display the replica as is, or add a blade to it at Savi’s Workshop – Handbuilt Lightsabers store. Actor Cameron Monaghan, who portrayed Cal in the game, visited Disneyland to get an early peek at his signature weapon and make it a full lightsaber. You can view the photos from his visit, such as the one above, at the Disney Parks Blog. \nThere’s no word how much Cal’s weapon will cost, but replica lightsabers can run for over $100, and adding a blade to them is similarly pricey. You can only buy the lightsaber at Galaxy’s Edge in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, FL or Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA.\nYou can watch us relieve Cal Ketis’ entire journey in our ongoing Super Replay of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which may hold you over as we eagerly await the confirmed sequel.\n[Source: Disney Parks Blog via Venture Beat]",

Keller even touched on some details regarding this change, including some switches to Doomfist’s moveset to make him a Tank. \n“He basically has a leap that’s similar to a Winston leap,” Keller said. \nWinston’s leap is more about horizontal movement whereas Doomfist’s leap, as it stands today in Overwatch, is about vertical height and resulting slamdown damage. It sounds like his leap will be more similar to Winston’s in Overwatch 2, which makes sense because it would give Doomfist the ability to reach a combat scenario quicker and tank some damage. \nPC Gamer reports that Keller further described the tank version of Doomfist as “more surviveable” with “good escape” capatilibies. During the stream, Overwatch lead hero designer Geoff Goodman said Doomfist “does a lot less damage” as a tank than when he was a hero, but he also said that today, in Overwatch 2’s closed alpha, Doomfist is overpowered and in need of a nerf. \nThis is a big change for Doomfist, which accompanies larger changes happening in Overwatch 2, like a shift to 5v5 gameplay. Bastion will also be wildly different in Overwatch 2, as well.

As expected, it features some sights that fans of Netflix’s Stranger Things will recognize, like the infamous Demogorgon, the trademark red skies, and more. As it’s still Far Cry 6, protagonist Dani Rojas will be the playable character during this crossover mission, but perhaps some familiar faces will show up in it, too. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nOn top of that, this mission will be playable by all because this weekend – March 24 through March 27 – Far Cry 6 will be free to play. Like the rest of Far Cry 6, this crossover mission can be played alone or in co-op. \nDespite being announced months ago with a release date less than 24 hours away, not much is known about this Stranger Things crossover. It’s certainly an odd piece of DLC, considering there’s not much, if anything, that connect the two franchises, but it looks like it’s going to be a good time nonetheless. Fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to find out because it’s out tomorrow. \nFor more about Far Cry 6, read Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 action games to play right now. After that, catch up on the Far Cry 4 Pagan Min DLC recently released for Far Cry 6. \nAre you excited for this Stranger Things crossover? Let us know in the comments below!",
