          "description": "I can sing a rail shooter.\nDeveloper Success’s flagship franchise since 1991, Cotton's enigmatic Halloween world and cutesy-witchy theme struck a chord with fans of the shoot-'em-up genre. Its zany premise of broomsticking across badlands in search of delicious candy, coupled with a magical mix of coloured gem grabbing, weapon power-ups, flashy bomb attacks, and mouthy fairies, have been staples in every instalment since the beginning.\nBar one pachinko outlier, most Cotton games follow the same 2D horizontal shooting format, including 2021's Cotton Fantasy: Superlative Night Dreams. But with Panorama Cotton, a 1994 Mega Drive exclusive and one of the system’s most technically impressive titles, Success switched the action to a 3D perspective, plotting the camera behind Cotton's back. It delivered a Space Harrier-style dynamic across eye-bleedingly colourful stages, occasionally with varying paths. Despite being a graphical showcase for the system, it wasn't as critically well-received as its predecessors, never appeared overseas (until 2021), and had a famously low print run.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Another Crab’s Treasure, from developer Aggro Crab, is another one of these endeavours, albeit with a significantly more colourful approach compared to the usual intensity of many Soulslikes.\nThe adventure begins with the introduction of protagonist, Kril, a Hermit Crab living above the surrounding ocean in a small tide pool. Before long, Kril is removed from his precious shell, as he now seemingly owes money to a creature by the name of the Duchess due to new tax laws. A Loan Shark — who takes the form of a plastic Shark-head-on-a-stick toy with a top hat — takes Kril’s shell as collateral, sending the adorable young crustacean on a journey to the depths of the ocean to retrieve his shell and return to his lovely tide pool. The writing is charming and full of witty remarks from the game’s cast of characters, resulting in an engaging narrative that will provide a few laughs here and there.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives?

Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.\nSaid hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.\nRead more",

It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too.

However, I do enjoy making maps turn a different colour in strategy games, Total War chiefly among them. Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit.

Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.\nStyczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.\r\n \nRead more",

Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

Those lord packs are now the three top rated expansions in the series’ history, and the base game itself saw a huge uptick in positive reviews. The last day also saw a peak player count of around 66,000, putting it ahead of giants like Palworld, Rimworld, and Fallout 76. None of this would be especially notable, however, if this wasn’t a complete turnaround from how things have been for the best part of a year now.\n \nRead more",

This production will likely be more faithful to the bard than to Amazon Prime. It will open with the line: \"Now is the nuclear winter of our discontent.\" \nRead more",

It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as \"a cross between a game and a stop motion film\", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.\nI love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.\nRead more",

          "description": "Unveiled last night at the IGN x ID@Xbox Digital Showcase, Vampire Survivors has received a free new update called Laborratory (yes, with two 'r's). It includes one new character, one secret character, three weapons, one stage, and a bonus go-cart racing stage. But perhaps most importantly of all, Poncle say they'll answer the question that's been on everyone's lips: \"Why is it called Santa Water?\". This is something that's puzzled me since the game's inception, and therefore, I will be thrusting myself back into the game where there are, in fact, no vampires at all. I need to know.\nRead more",

The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of \"in the fall\". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). \nBefore that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) \"a big update that's coming really soon\", and that \"we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff.\" This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year. \nRead more",

Microsoft si před deseti lety koupil mobilní divizi finské Nokie, za nemalého přispění CEO Nokie Stephena Elopa, předtím vysoce postaveného manažera Microsoftu. Softwarový gigant, kterému krutě ujížděl vlak na poli mobilních platforem si koupil telefonního giganta, kterému také krutě ujížděl vlak. Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone. Výsledek se dostavil o 4 roky později, kdy Microsoft definitivně vydáním posledního telefonu s Windows Phone současně celou akvizici za 7 miliard dolarů odepsal a začal se soustředit na jiné cesty jak vydělávat v mobilním světě.",

Since then there's been more ECC UDIMMs coming to market above DDR5-4800 speeds. Recently I bought a pair of Kingston Server Premier 32GB 5600MT/s DDR5 ECC CL46 UDIMMs (KSM56E46BD8KM-32HA) and that's the focus of today's tests. For those curious if the faster ECC UDIMMs are worthwhile compared to the commonality of DDR5-4800 ECC UDIMMs, these benchmarks are for you.",

It could also be because it was probably the last console that a lot of people played through fuzzy RF, and something about video noise makes the experience feel more tangibly real.\n\n\nNonetheless, returning to the blocky pixelation of the early 3D era brought about a renaissance in the horror genre, and if C…",

          "description": "Patch 10.2.7 just dropped, and that means a new questline that helps tie Dragonflight into the upcoming expansion, The War Within. You'll need to complete the questline to get caught up on the latest World of Warcraft storyline.\n\n\nHow to get the Quest \"The Harbinger\"\n\n\nWhen you log in, you'll likely be treated to some dialogue from everybody's favorite WoW grandpa, Archmage Khadgar. A quest should automatically appear in your log titled \"The Harbinger.\" With it, you should see an option to use a Dalaran Hearthstone in order to appear in the Legion version of the floating mage city.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you port in, head straight and then hang a left into the central building. Go step on the glowing pad in the center of the room to teleport to the inner chambers like in the good ol' Legion days. Once you are inside, hang a right. You should see Alleria Windrunner doing a cool lean on the wall. If you click on her, you can watch the newest cinematic leading into The War Within.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the movie plays out, you can talk to Khadgar for a few more points of information before turning in the quest. This includes playing some cutscenes to help get you caught up with the story, if you've been away for a while.\n\n\nTurn around and you'll see Alleria at the bottom of the steps with a new quest, \"Door to the Ren'Dorei.\" Follow the chain from there to complete the \"Hunt the Harbinger\" Achievement. Note: this quest is currently kind of buggy. If Alleria doesn't open a portal for you in the chamber, leave the mage tower and abandon the quest. Then go back in and get the quest again. Before you go down the last set of stairs, stand and wait for Alleria to open the portal all the way.\n\nThe post How to start “The Harbinger” quest in World of Warcraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Make it Rain Campaign is back and this time, as one of the rewards, players can finally get their hands on the glorious Kappa Suit. \n\n\nMade infamous by the father of Final Fantasy himself, Hironobu Sakaguchi, cosplaying in the suit at Fan Festival, the Kappa Suit has been long awaited. The wait is almost over though, as the Make it Rain Campaign will begin on May 15, running until May 31.\n\n\nTo begin the event, players will need to head to the Gold Saucer and talk to Quevain (X:9.4, Y:9.2), picking up the starting quest called “Of Impish Importance”. \n\n\nAs well as the Kappa Suit itself, players will also be able to get their hands on some new furniture items:\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nThe Cactuar Dining Table and the Senor Sabotender Chronometer will likely be available to purchase during the Make it Rain Campaign 2024, with the Kappa Suit being rewarded for completing this year's event quest(s). \n\n\nAs well as this year’s exclusive rewards up for grabs, players can enjoy a boost in terms of how much MGP they can earn by taking part in Gold Saucer attractions such as GATEs, Cactpot, and other minigames. \n\n\nSome Gold Saucer exclusive rewards also receive a reduction in price, as well, so this event is a good time to get your hands on huge stacks of MGP for those rewards you’ve been after.

Epic is, of course, working on a fix but, in the meantime, it's opted to disable the Back Bling. So, if you bought it from the shop, you can't equip it to your character.\n\n\n\n\nEpic has also removed the Yoda Back Bling from the shop so nobody else can purchase it, along with the Dagobah Luke skin and Disassembled C-3PO Back Bling. Epic hasn't said why those two cosmetics were targeted as well. There's nothing to indicate they're somehow triggering crashes too, and it's not as if they are tied to the Yoda Back Bling in the shop; all three cosmetics can be purchased separately. However, the Luke skin and C-3PO Back Bling haven't been disabled, so those who own them can still use them. You just can't buy them for now.\n\n\nWhile Epic will assuredly add the Yoda Back Bling back into Fortnite and undo the shop removals once the bug is fixed, this is bound to be frustrating for anyone who had been saving up the V-Bucks for these cosmetics, as well as those who spent them on the Yoda cosmetic already. A quick glance through the Twitter replies shows a few players are expecting some form of compensation, while others are asking for fixes for other unrelated issues.

The Dark Heart patch brings a trove of new content including the WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria event and the starter questline leading into the new The War Within expansion. However, a revamped LFG system has come with an unintended bug disallowing players from joining groups. Here's how to fix the WoW 10.2.7 LFG Bug and properly use the Premade Groups finder.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to fix the WoW patch 10.2.7 LFG Premade Group Finder bug\n\n\nYou can fix the LFG premade group finder bug by enabling the Mature Language Filter in the Social options menu. If you jump into WoW patch 10.2.7. and go to join a Premade Group from the LFG tool, you may notice it's not working. Unfortunately, the latest patch introduced a bug that can cause the finder to not work properly due to a bug with the Mature Language Filter. Thankfully, it's easy to fix! This is how you enable the Mature Language filter in WoW to make the LFG tool work:\n\n\n\nHit Escape to open the WoW Game Menu.\n\n\nClick on Options.\n\n\nUnder Gameplay on the left, click Social.\n\n\nClick the third option down, Mature Language Filter, to enable it.\n\n\n\nThis bug fix will make your LFG tool start working. You can now open the Premade Groups finder and start looking for groups without it bugging out, allowing you to properly start doing dungeons. If the fix did not work, double check you in fact enabled the Mature Language Filter, then also verify your addons are up to date, as some may conflict with the new LFG tool. Finally, restart your World of Warcraft once you've verified the Mature Language Filter is enabled and the LFG tool will start working.\n\nThe post How to fix WoW 10.2.7 LFG Bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stats show that the COR-45 has the fastest time-to-kill among short-range meta weapons, but players aren't maximizing the pistol's potential on PC if they aren't using an underrated setting. \n\n\nIn search of the best weapon for short-range engagements after the Season 3 Reloaded update, IceManIsaac stumbled across the COR-45. According to data from TrueGameData, the COR-45 has a significantly faster TTK than other popular weapons, at 525 milliseconds from zero meters away. \n\n\nFor comparison, the Holger 26 comes in at 539, and MCW is at 600. With the XRK Lightning Fire trigger action and XRK IP-V2 conversion kits equipped that TTK improves to 400. However, that figure comes with a catch, as the weapon becomes semi-auto with the conversion, meaning players won't be able to reach that top speed because it's not possible for a person to fire a weapon that fast, pressing as fast as they can.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIceManIsaac showed it's possible to shoot 12-and-a-half times per second with the lightning fire trigger, but the average person can only shoot eight to 10 times per second. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to improve that delay even more.\n\n\n\nGo into mouse settings \n\n\nScroll down to calibration \n\n\nIn the drop-down menu under mouse calibration, set mouse wheel delay to 0\n\n\n\nWith the mouse wheel delay removed, firing with the mouse wheel will feel like using a fully automatic weapon. As a result, the COR-45 will have one of the best TTK speeds in Warzone and shred through enemies almost immediately. \n\nThe post One setting on PC makes COR-45 fastest killing weapon in Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "To build up anticipation for XDefiant, Ubisoft announced the All-Star Series, an eight-team tournament featuring FPS legends.\n\n\nXDefiant All-Star Series challenges 16 of the best FPS competitors to compete in teams of four for a cash prize. Ubisoft confirmed that each qualifying round will be broadcast on YouTube before the finals on May 21, coinciding with the title's official release. The first matchup, featuring Aches and Pacman as team captains, will air on May 8 at 10 AM PT.\n\n\nScreenshot via Ubisoft\n\n\nPatrick \"ACHES\" Price is a two-time CoD world champion and a core compLexity and Evil Geniuses dynasty member, which won 13 offline tournaments. In 2022, ACHES joined Ubisoft as a game developer and helped work on XDefiant. Meanwhile, Jonathan \"Pacman\" Tucker is also a former professional CoD player who had a long-respected career, and went on to coach and manage teams. \n\n\nUbisoft wouldn't reveal the cash prize amount or full rosters, but there are plenty of exciting options for former FPS legends who would be itching to compete again. Based on everything shared during the official release date announcement, Ubisoft plans to support a competitive scene in XDefiant. The title will launch with a Ranked Mode practice playlist to test out 4v4 matches. The devs will release an official version of the game mode after the trial run, which will most likely narrow down the weapon and map pool. It's unclear if there will be an official league, but in March, Delco Gaming announced an official XDefiant roster.\n\nThe post XDefiant hosts first competitive tournament ahead of launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

So, if you're looking to elevate its performance, here are the best Tyranitar movesets in Pokémon Go that will surely bolster your battle strategies.\n\n\nWhat moves are the best for Tyranitar in Pokémon Go?\n\n\nTyranitar's move sets depend on the type of round you are playing, including PvE and PvP. While PvP is a high-octane, fast-paced challenge, PvE allows for a more strategic approach. We'll equip you with the best Tyranitar movesets for both Pokémon Go modes, empowering you to conquer any battle scenario.\n\n\nBest Tyranitar PvP moveset in Pokémon Go\n\n\nFor better chances, you can use Smack Down and Brutal Swing in PvP. Smack Down features one of the highest DPS rates out of all the Fast Attacks, making it an easy choice for its move sets. This move is particularly effective against Flying, Bug, Fire, and Ice types. However, if you don't have this ability, Bite can be a helpful substitute.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen it comes to a Charged Attack, Brutal Swing is a reliable choice. Although it doesn't pack the same punch as Stone Edge, its lower energy cost makes it a valuable asset in PvP battles. Remember, in PvP, speed is key, and moves like Brutal Swing can give you the edge you need. \n\n\nBest Tyranitar PvE moveset in Pokémon Go\n\n\nThe best Tyranitar movesets for PvE are Bite and Brutal Swing. Bite can be devasting when paired with Brutal Swing. Together, they provide a high DPS rate without costing too much energy. No matter what, Brutal Swing should be your go-to for both PvE and PvP, especially against Ghost and Psychic types. \n\nThe post Tyranitar Best Moveset in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.\nThis offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. \n\n\nIGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible \"to receive the value of the upgrade\" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. \nRedfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, \"I'm upset with myself,\" when asked about its launch.\nAccording to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow do you feel about Microsoft shutting down Arkane Austin?

Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled \"A Blink in Time,\" introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.\nThe new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:\nBlink (5 Cost, 7 Power)\n\n\t\nOn reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.\n\n\t\nNocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)\n\t\nYou can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.\n\n\t\nSage (3 Cost, 0 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.\n\n\t\nNamora (5 Cost, 6 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.\n\n\t\nSasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)\n\t\nCosts 1 less for each card you played last turn.\n\n                  \n\nOn top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.\nMarvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today.

This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. \nSince the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. \n\n\nElsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. \nWith the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. \nIn the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games.

However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. \nWhile this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million.

          "description": "Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!\nThis second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.\nSee Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

After playing several hours of the Early Access build (which is publicaly available as of today), we traveled to Supergiant Games' studio in San Francisco to interview several of the core team members – creative director Greg Kasavin, studio director Amir Rao, art director Jen Zee, composer Darren Korb, and voice actor Logan Cunningham – to get the full story of the game's creation. The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future. It also features an in-depth breakdown of Hades II's new features and our impressions …",

However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. \nThis follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. \nThank you for your feedback.\nMay 3, 2024\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. \nGhost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you going to play Ghost of Tsushima on PC?

The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.\nFounders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year.

As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. \nThis news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n\n\n\"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources,\" the release reads. \"As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024.\" \nWhile potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. \nThis release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February.

As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. \n\n\nAs noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. \nAs for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: \"For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more.\"\nOther updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game.

For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.\nWe don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases \"spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces.\" Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.\nHowever, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.\nAre you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!",

In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. \nThankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next.

The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",
