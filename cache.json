Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware.

Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort.

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.\nThis is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.\nRead more",

          "description": "My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist?

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"The cool thing about bombs is that you can hide them in anything,\" is probably my favourite Oppenheimer quote of all time, and in the case of Ian Hitman, it does raise an important question: with so many everyday objects equal to the rubber duck in its unthreatening aura, yet more inconspicuous, why choose to put an explosive in this one?\nThe simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.\nRead more",

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths.

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.\nAnd then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.\r\n \nRead more",

It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.\n“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.\nRead more",

Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.\nRead more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.\nIn fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.\nRead more",

The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally.

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended?

          "description": "I didn’t get much further in the extremely popular beta for the haute-couture-asaurus action of Monster Hunter Wilds than perfecting the exact orange-to-white ratio of my cat. Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.\nRead more",

This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out.

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.\n Read more",

Na výběr jsou v současnosti tři možnosti: PREEMPT_NONE pro servery, PREEMP_VOLUNTARY pro desktop a PREEMPT pro desktop s požadavkem na nízké latence. Vybrat je potřeba při kompilaci jádra. Navíc existuje od jádra 5.12 možnost PREEMPT_DYNAMIC, kdy je možné volbu nastavit jako parametr jádra. Bohužel na některých platformách (arm64) je to spojené se značnou dodatečnou režií, proto se nepoužívá.

          "description": "The Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and it's an unique challenge in every way. \n\n\nFor starters, you'll get a total of 100 different items by completing the challenge, but there's no guarantee of a promo item or a walkout. You'll have to submit three squads to complete the SBC, so it requires a fair few amount of fodder for sure. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge to unlock the rewards. \n\n\nEA FC 25 Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC tasks\n\n\nThe Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC has three different tasks, and here are their conditions. \n\n\nTask 1 - 82-rated squad\n\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 82\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 82-rated squad\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Team of the Week\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 82\n\n\n\nTask 3 - 83-rated squad\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Team of the Week\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 83\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's a set of solutions you can use to complete the SBC for cheap. \n\n\nTask 1 - 82-rated squad\n\n\n\nAny 10 82-rated items\n\n\nAny 1 81-rated item\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 82-rated squad\n\n\n\nAny 10 82-rated items\n\n\nAny 1 81-rated TOTW\n\n\n\nTask 3 - 83-rated squad\n\n\n\nAny 10 83-rated items\n\n\nAny 1 82-rated TOTW\n\n\n\nAfter completing the challenge, you'll get a 100 Mixed Players Pack. This is an unique pack, and it contains a total of 100 player items. The player items will be divided into 20 Rare Gold, 25 Common Gold, 30 Silver, and 25 Bronze. One of the card is guaranteed to be rated 84 or higher. \n\n\nWhile the SBC suddenly looks interesting, try it out only if you have enough disposable TOTW items. TOTW items are extremely important, and they're being required in almost every good SBC. Hence, it might have some merit to hold on to them for the future SBCs to come in Ultimate Team. \n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete Centurions 100 Upgrade SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher Whitethorn Games announced plans to bring Balloon Studios' puzzler to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on December 17, 2024. \n\n\nThere's nothing unique to the consoles to keep an eye out for with this release, but at the very least it offers another way to explore this quaint and thoughtful little gem. Check out a brief look at the PS4 and PS5 versions in the announcement video below.\n\n\n\n\nBotany Manor first opened its gates on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam) on April 9. It's also available via Game Pass for any subscribers who want to give it a quick go as part of their membership. \n\n\nFor those who haven't done so yet, Botany Manor follows retired botanist Arabella Greene. Thanks to her storied career, she now has a large collection of rare, and in some cases forgotten, plants. It's up to you to explore the manor, dig through Arabella's notes, and find out the right way to ensure their growth and continued survival. \n\n\nBotany Manor isn't just about bringing a bunch of plants back to life. Well, that's a large part of it, but it also hinges on learning more about Arabella's experiences as a woman scientist in the 19th century. You'll be able to piece together her life and what she went through, all while gathering the clues necessary to help the manor's many plants thrive. If you love plants but have the polar opposite of a green thumb, this is your ideal escape.\n\nThe post Botany Manor makes PS4, PS5 debut on December 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

One of the channels to visit is #announcements, where you'll find the latest news about the game development. The next step is to head to the #updates channel for more details about new content. Other useful channels are #league-rules, #giveaways, and #general.\n\n\nHow to use LOCKED Discord\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDownload the Discord app and create an account to access the LOCKED Discord server.

Prices should be similar to those of Eminem’s and Snoop’s skins, so expect prices to be as follows:\n\n\n\nIce Spice and Rap Princess outfits: 1,500 V-Bucks each\n\n\nEmote: 500 V-Bucks\n\n\nJam Tracks: 500 V-Bucks\n\n\nMicrophone / Pickaxe: 800 V-Bucks\n\n\n\nLike the other two rappers, Ice Spice should also have a discounted bundle with all of her accessories. It’ll most likely also include the tracks used in the Fortnite Festival mode.\n\n\nHer skin and all accessories will be available starting November 14, 2024, at 4 PM PST / 6 PM CST.

An older game may not have support for higher resolution monitors, game controllers, or even operating systems.

          "description": "If EA FC 25 rumors are to be believed, Track Stars is going to be the next promo, and we already have the first set of leaks doing the rounds on social media.\n\n\nLike the previously released Total Rush promo, Track Stars will make its debut in this year's Ultimate Team. As of writing, it's not clear if the upcoming campaign will be a one or two-week affair. Nevertheless, a new campaign is always exciting, and there could be some amazing cards to find in the packs.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Track Stars player leaks\n\n\nThere haven't been too many leaks so far, but there's an indication that Track Stars will have a new version of Heroes. So far, we have had the base versions of Heroes that can be found in the packs. The Track Stars variant could be quite popular, but it will depend on which footballers are going to be present in it.\n\n\nSo far, these are the names that have been leaked to appear in the upcoming campaign.\n\n\n\nTheo Hernandez\n\n\nLucio\n\n\nDaMarcus Beasley\n\n\n\nOut of the names leaked so far, Beasley is rumored to appear as a SBC. This will be great news for those who don't want to rely on pack luck. A SBC makes it possible for all to obtain the card, but it will largely depend on the completion cost of the challenge.\n\n\nMore names are expected to be leaked as the release date comes closer.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Track Stars release date\n\n\nUnless there's any significant change in the schedule, Centurions will be a one-week affair. In simpler words, the currently available cards will be removed from the packs on Friday, November 15. Track Stars will be a direct replacement for the Centurions promo, and it could light up Ultimate Team right before Black Friday celebrations kick in.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see which footballers eventually make it to the promo, and how their special cards will look like in terms of stats and playstyles. \n\nThe post All EA FC 25 Track Stars promo player leaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes more data on the system requirements, which will be vital for PC players before they purchase their copy. If you're on the Xbox and have access to the Game Pass or bought a copy, you can download the full game a week before the official launch.\n\n\nSTALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl file size on Xbox\n\n\nThe pre-download for STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl went live on Xbox on November 12, and it stands at a staggering 146 GB. This is the same for users on both Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, so you'll need to clear plenty of space to download all the files.\n\n\nYou can pre-download the file regardless of whether you purchased a standalone copy or are a member of the Xbox Game Pass. The new STALKER title will be a day-one entrant to the Xbox Game Pass. Subscribers won't have to pay any additional money to enjoy the game on the very first day.\n\n\nSTALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl file size on PC\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nWhile I have yet to test out the download system on Steam, the game can be pre-downloaded via the Xbox PC app. All you have to do is search for the game and start the download.

It's likely going to remain the same if you purchase your copy on Steam.\n\n\nWhile it's preferable to download the game on your SSD, you may also choose to install it on your HDD.

          "description": "Whether or not you side with Technikki to turn Shipshape Island into an airship or Adaphne to turn it into a submarine, you’ll need to borrow something from Bowser. An airship engine, to be precise.\n\n\nI’m going to be honest here, this is probably the only time in the game I got snagged. Reviewing a game early means I don’t have access to guides to get unstuck, so I did circles for a while to figure this out. The solution is something that might be obvious to you, I might have even missed a subtle hint spouted by a character, but it left me temporarily flummoxed, so you can learn from my mistakes.\n\n\nYou may have seen the airship engine on your first visit to Wayaway Island. When you enter Bowser’s store room to get the ampberries, the engine can be seen on the other side of a barrier. I want you to forget that you saw that, because it’s very misleading.\n\n\nMy first course of action was to return to that room, then find the way into it based on its layout. However, if you check where the door is and make the assumption that the entrance is on the same floor, you’re not going to find it. You don’t need to backtrack through Bowser’s Castle on Wayaway Island. In fact, in order to get to the airship engine, you don’t need to go back through Bowser’s Castle at all.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nInstead, before you would enter the castle the usual way, instead go east down the path that runs in front of Bowser’s Castle. Along this way, you’ll find the back door. In there, you’ll need to use a Bros. Bomb (Ice/Fire charged attack) to break the boulder in the way. You can now proceed onward.\n\n\nFrom there, it’s a bit of a tricky labyrinth to get to the storage room. It’s mostly skill-based, and it’s a straight shot to your destination. A pretty big relief if you had trouble finding where you were supposed to go in the first place.\n\nThe post Where to find the Airship Engine in Mario and Luigi: Brothership appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While it definitely wouldn't rank amongst the best console ads of all time, Sony just released a pretty cool new PlayStation ad on their YouTube channel featuring one of the best surprises we've gotten from Sony in a while. \n\n\n\n\nThese ads are always cool to look at. This time we get a glimpse at what seems like PlayStation city, a place where PlayStation's famous triangle, circle, square and X replace the regular traffic signs in a way that somehow doesn't result in an accidental Carmageddon remake. We also see some buildings turning into the PlayStation's symbols, and it looks cool, but the best part comes right at the end, when it announces a price drop of $70 on the PS5 Slim Digital Edition.\n\n\nThe price reduction is yet to take effect on the PlayStation direct online story, so don't get too hasty on your acquisition. Still, Sony notes the promo will last until Christmas or while supplies last, so I hope you manage to find the perfect balance between the two.\n\n\nSure, the comments make sure to remind players about the dire reality of having to buy the stand separately, but you don't really need one to enjoy your games. While the notion of a console only getting a temporary price drop four years after its release date would've been laughable in any other gen of PlayStation, this is better than no Christmas miracle at all. This piece of news feels even better when you realize how, for the first time in a long while, scalpers' plans went awry as they stocked up on a bunch of PS5 Pros that nobody is buy at ridiculous prices and have since begun selling them at a loss.\n\n\nYou can now get the PS5's Slim Digital Edition for $379.99 until Christmas, or until supplies are depleted.\n\nThe post The PS5 Slim Digital Edition is only $379.99 until Christmas appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits?

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.\nWe are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.\nIf you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.\nNow go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM's Global Main Menu.\n>",
