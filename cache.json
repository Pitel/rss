Luckily, that last title proved to be a strong return to form for the series, and after a DLC expansion (on PC) that was also well-received, Frozenbyte was able to justify greenlighting a full-fledged sequel in the 2.5D tradition. Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy certainly doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it proves beyond any doubt that the developers still have a lot of great ideas to explore and it stands as yet another high-quality entry in the ongoing series.\nTrine 5 once again follows the exploits of Amadeus the Wizard, Zoya the Thief, and Pontius the Knight who are now quite famous in their world for saving the day many times. The heroes are reunited after being summoned by Lady Sunny for a celebration ceremony to commemorate their achievements. However, upon arrival, the regent quickly reveals her true colors and attempts to steal the heroes’ power from them, aided by an army of clockwork knights built by Lord Godric. Our heroes manage to escape in time, and this kicks off a quest to defeat the elusive and power-hungry Lady Sunny before she seizes control of the kingdom.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Going through the motion controls.\nIn the Wii's heyday, some executive or other higher-up at Nintendo dove into the multitude of factors that converged to make the Wii such a resounding success. Among the factors was the idea that motion—even at a minuscule level, like flicking one's wrist—was tied to the brain's production of dopamine. Pairing that concept with the dazzling chimes and flashing lights of a video game intensified that sensation and added a deepened sense of interactivity.\nFlicking your wrist to swing a tennis racket in Wii Sports felt so good—and continues to 'hit different' today in Nintendo Switch Sports. Sure, the novelty's worn off a bit, but there's no denying that it just feels right. While VR has carved out a niche for itself as the new home for motion-controlled games, the Switch Joy-Con controllers still make a good host for the occasional motion-fueled jaunt. Unfortunately, Samba de Amigo: Party Central, the first true sequel to the original 1999 Dreamcast maraca-shaking game, doesn't use them particularly well. This is where the vast majority of Party Central's biggest issues stem from.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The original Destiny storyline opened following the collapse of a vast Terran civilization at the hands of an invading, amorphous Darkness and its various alien accomplices - an advance stymied only by a benevolent Big Dumb Object known as the Traveller. It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary and/or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. \r\n\n\r\nFast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, \"episodic\" - content \"cadence\" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).\nTechnically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest.

Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Before Diablo 4 came out, Blizzard had concerns that their latest ARPG would tank the popularity of their most recent entry in the series, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson tells RPS. Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. \"In fact, it was the opposite,\" he says.\nRead more",

          "description": "When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was \"who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum\". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's \"creative sequel\" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the \"what if\" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield. Find a trailer through the jump.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to \"-gate\" status, with \"Tilegate\" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing \"dreamable\" space sim Noctis. \r\n\n\r\nWho knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Granblue Fantasy: Relink has been on my most anticipated games list for two-years, with all of my anticipation based purely off bitty trailers that haven't revealed anything other than its flashy action RPG combat and deeply anime towns. So, I was rather excited when I had a chance to play it for all of ten minutes in one demo, then around 40 minutes at this year's Gamescom.\nBlazing fast mental arithmetic puts my total time with the game at around 50 minutes... with a catch. The two demos were identical, though, so all of my time was dedicated to smashing the same large skeleton and large rock man. I got to know them and it's battle system intimately, I suppose, so while I can't speak for the quests, but the fights? Gloriously chaotic.\nRead more",

          "description": "Vampires might be the themed threat for Diablo 4's second season, but it was arguably its own player base who drew first blood when season one started at the end of July. As you may have heard by now, Diablo's Season Of The Malignant didn't exactly go down all that well, with much of the hissing and fang-bearing directed toward its nerf-heavy balance patch that arrived a couple of days before the season started in earnest - a series of events that Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson describes as \"a perfect storm of a couple of situations\" when I sit down to talk with him at Gamescom. \n\"Season one was exceptional, because we did something we'd never do again,\" says Fergusson. \"As part of listening to players wanting to carry over their renown, we had to put the patch out a couple of days before the season. The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "What's the first derelict and/or abandoned (but is it really abandoned???) spaceship you ever visited in a videogame? I'm struggling to pin it down through the growing white noise of early middle age - as with much else in my life, everything blends into a gritty soup of Metroid and DOOM beyond the turn of the millennium - but I suspect it might have been a level from Rebellion's amazing 1999 Giger 'em up Aliens versus Predator, which I now recall only as screenfuls of fangs illuminated by Smartgun fire. \r\n\n\r\nDoes Sonic 2's Flying Fortress Zone count as abandoned, given that almost every NPC aboard is robotic? Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile \"Legendary\" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame. There's fresh news on this front from senior level designer Zach Wilson, who has been waxing lyrical online about \"the tragedies and perils of space travel\".\nRead more",

In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's \"HD-2D\" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is. \nRead more",

My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.\nI may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.\nRead more",

The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. \nThe Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.\nRead more",

Inspired by, rather than tracing over the rail grinding, spraypainting, all-dancing classic. It plays a little smoother, it clocks in shorter, and runs a little faster, but it's undeniably dancing to the same beat.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.\nThe game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here.

I thought it was obnoxious and underwhelming, in all the ways you'd expect from a colourful hero shooter whose hook is stealing Sonic merch.\nBut this year I got to spend a good 30-minutes in a match against other players and have come away… pleasantly surprised. I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, \"the entire game will be good\", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.\nRead more",

But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. \nOn its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing? \nRead more",

          "description": "We already knew that roguelite sequel Streets Of Rogue 2 was going open world, but we finally saw the free-flowing chaos in action at last night’s Gamescom blowout. The immersive sim playground, sequel to an RPS favourite from 2019, looks even more over-the-top than the original. You can smash through buildings in a truck. Or smash through buildings on horseback. Or smash through buildings as a giant gorilla. Or... you get the gist. In other words, there should be a metric mega-ton of options when the game hits early access next year, as you'd expect if you played the first Streets Of Rogue.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic's venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Following the trajectory of the previous two games, Little Nightmares the third has two controllable protagonists, so you can play in co-op.

Hence, though I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in open world survival crafting games like yer Valheims and what have you, I cocked my head like a dazzled magpie at the Gamescom release date trailer for Nightingale. It's the chintzy big swing fantasy (okay, Victoriana urban fantasy but it still counts) coming from Aaryn Flynn-founded studio Inflexion Games. And it's coming to an early access release near you on February 22nd next year.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've been keeping an eye on Stormgate, the upcoming free-to-play RTS being made by former Starcraft II and Warcraft III devs, then its big bads, the Infernal Host, will probably be familiar in name, if nothing else. But during tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, we got our first proper look at this demonic alien faction, as well as three of the units that will be at our disposal on release. And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault. It's kinda gross, but also weirdly rad? In any case, I'm into it.\nRead more",

          "description": "LG's 27GL850 was a legendary monitor, as this 27-inch model was the first to use the Korean chaebol's Fast IPS panels - which combined the extremely fast pixel response times you'd expect to see on TN panels with the wide viewing angles and gorgeous colours of IPS screens. This combination proved popular, and today there's a deal on the modern successor to the 27GL850 - the 27GP850. \nThe 27GP850 is down to $299.99 at Amazon, versus an original price of $429.99. We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup. \nRead more",

Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).\nThe rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.\nRead more",

Problém řeší analog in-memory computing, kdy se maticové násobení vektorem dělá paralelně v paměťových dlaždicích (memory tiles). Používá se k tomu phase-change memory (PCM). Malý kousek materiálu se roztaví a podle rychlosti chlazení buď zkrystalizuje (pomalu) a bude vodivý, nebo zůstane amorfní (rychle) a bude nevodivý.

          "description": "The existence of Sonic Superstars is a beautiful, mystifying conundrum.\nIf you owned a Sega Genesis growing up, you probably know that a co-op Sonic game is a bad idea. Sonic runs too fast, the screen moves too quickly, and player two often gets lost off-screen. So when I learned the upcoming Sonic Superstars would offer a multiplayer sidescrolling Sonic experience, I couldn’t help but scratch my head. Sure, our own Eric “the Hedgehog” Van Allen covered this already, so I knew the game was already toying with some 2D Sonic fundamentals. But the how and why of a Sonic Superstars co-op mode continued to eat at me. How could a game like this ever work?\nFortunately, during a recent event held by Sega, I was able to sit down with a demo of Sonic Superstars that let players get into the trenches…",

          "description": "Samba De Amigo: Party Central is out now, to the rejoice of anyone craving a Latin-themed music game. The original game produced by Yuji Naka received several ports since its 1999 release, but this marks the first proper sequel since then.\nParty Central launched with an exciting and colorful trailer featuring its cast dancing to Mr. Worldwide. It's a stylistic choice I approve of, as a Miami native.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9j1maxNVs8\nBeyond marking the revival of a classic franchise, Samba De Amigo: Party Central fills a hole for more stylized rhythm games. Anyone wanting to bust a move while at home was pretty much stuck to the Just Dance games, so this will be refreshing to anyone wanting something different.\nSomething odd about this release is its chosen platforms. Nintendo Switch is unsurprising due to the type of game this is, but it's also coming to Apple Arcade as Samba de Amigo: Party-To-Go. It looks like it'll be fun regardless, and will likely appeal to many casual players with the subscription. A VR Samba de Amigo is also expected sometime later this year.\nMultiplayer is the highlighted feature in the trailer, but there is also a story mode. Given the musically whimsical nature, it looks like a light-hearted adventure featuring protagonist Amigo and friends.\nWhile Samba De Amigo: Party Central looks like a blast, the game lacks one of the original's iconic features. Something that made it special was the special maracas players used to follow the beats, but Joy-Cons and touch controls have seemingly made them outdated.\nStill, it's good news for Sega fans and rhythm game fans. Assuming it lives up to the original game, Party Central can hopefully be a wonderful revival of a classic franchise.\nThe post Samba De Amigo: Party Central gets the party started on Switch today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beat 'em up fans have been brawling with up to three friends locally for a while, but now online co-op extends to four players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. \nThis follows some recent patches that have been put in place to improve balance and performance. Animation was increased to 60FPS on PS4, PS5, Xbox, and PC along with upgraded Switch performance. Combos and juggles have also been adjusted for a more user-friendly experience. Those who already traversed the mean streets from end to end can continue to do so with repeat playthroughs of New Game+.\n[caption id=\"attachment_400060\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via WayForward[/caption]\nReturn to River City\nTo get everyone up to speed on the series, WayForward shared a River City Girls series trailer. The games flip the script on the River City Ransom story, this time tasking Misako and Kyoko with rescuing their kidnapped boyfriends. The sequel ups the stakes and has our heroes brawling with the yakuza to take the city back. It's all set to lively pixel art visuals and a scorching soundtrack by Megan McDuffee. The Sean \"Jacksepticeye\" McLoughlin-voiced Godai narrates the overview below. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyQyKdKIPrA\nAfter the first game's 2019 debut, River City Girls 2 made its way to consoles and PC in December 2022. As as a spinoff to the Kunio-kun / River City Ransom series, WayForward carved a nice little niche of its own. If you're looking to get into the series, WayForward introduced new digital bundles that pack in all three games. River City Girls, River City Girls 2, and River City Girls Zero are all included for a $74.99 bundle price. \nThe post River City Girls 2 update adds 4-player online co-op for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher Just For Games and developer Little Sewing Machine first announced the \"thrilling horror adventure\" back in April. Following a cinematic reveal trailer in June, the first gameplay preview was showcased behind closed doors at last week's Gamescom event. Now the rest of us can see how the visuals carry over to the adventure-style gameplay. \nAs the trailer notes, footage comes from a \"very early\" pre-alpha version of the game. Complete voice acting (in Italian and English) and other final assets will be added later. I'm getting some real Clock Tower vibes from the footage so far. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuM4LqSR_5A\nTimeless inspirations \nBye Sweet Carole comes from Remothered creator Chris Darril. Much like Studio MDHR's Cuphead, the developers behind it took inspiration from cartoons of the past. Instead of citing specific films, they simply give a nod to \"the greatest animation movies.\" Feel free to fill in the blank with your own personal favorites. There's definitely a classic Disney / Don Bluth aesthetic to it all. \n[caption id=\"attachment_399997\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Just For Games[/caption]\nThe story finds Lana Benton trailing Carole Simmons, who previously escaped 19th century orphanage Bunny Hall. True to its name, a colony of wild rabbits has taken over, all with the power to open a portal to the world of Corolla. Don't feel left out of this lagomorph legend, though, because you'll also be able to transform into a bunny. \nBye Sweet Carole is currently in the works for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Don't mark your calendars just yet, because it won't be ready until sometime in 2024. \nThe post Hand-drawn horror game Bye Sweet Carole reveals its slickly animated gameplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

The situation is now resolved, with the developer HoYoverse making a statement that the issues have been fixed and perpetrators have been banned.\nBefore the official statement though, there was a period of confusion and uncertainty among players. Some panicked. Others responded with memes.

          "description": "To say that the Starfield community is excited about the game's early access release on September 1 would be a severe understatement. The game is now at the top of Steam charts, for one, and even though an odd leak here and there may have tried to throw a wrench in the hype, it doesn't seem like there's a way for this train to stop before it reaches its inevitable destination. It's not too surprising, then, that some community members have patched together an impromptu pre-release Starfield character planner to let fans theory craft away while they wait.\nIt's not an awfully long wait until Starfield comes out, granted, but the fact of the matter is that this is Bethesda Game Studios' next big sandbox RPG. A certain amount of pre-release hype was to be expected.\n[caption id=\"attachment_3998…",

It was an extremely influential game, and it’s still very entertaining to play today, but it was a pioneer on ground that has since become well-trodden. Typically, this sort of game that was important but largely superseded would be found in one of any number of game collections. But The Making of Karateka is not that.\nSure, you don’t just get Karateka. You also get a number of ports, prototypes, a full remaster, and a remastered prototype.

It will be coming to Switch on October 5.\nFront Mission 2 was originally supposed to be released back in June 12, 2023, but was delayed. I took that devastating news with dignity and a stiff upper lip and only cried a lot. At the time, Forever Entertainment said that they wanted an additional window to cram as many features into it as possible.\nhttps://youtu.be/8VeqGrxGaR4?feature=shared\nOriginally released on PS1 in 1997, this remake will be the first time that Front Mission 2 has graced our shores. Forever Entertainment is currently in the process of remaking the first three games in the series, but here’s hoping that they don’t stop there.\nThe first Front Mission was already remade as Front Mission 1st (remake) and released last November. It’s not the greatest game, but I loved the heck out of it and appreciate the effort taken to localize them. Coincidentally, I just bought and started the PC version of it yesterday. One of my complaints about the Switch version was its technical deficiencies, so I’ve been waiting for a good chance to grab a port on a more powerful console.\nHowever, I won’t be waiting when it comes to Front Mission 2. I’ll be grabbing it when it drops on Switch October 5, 2023.\nThe post Front Mission 2: Remake puts on its robot boots for October 5 on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's all very fine, but one modder decided that the post-apocalyptic RPG needed an injection of some added flora and fauna.\nOver on Nexus Mods (as spotted by DSO Gaming), user StamperDoesMods has created \"Mutant Menagerie - Life Finds a Way,\" a mod for Fallout 4 that adds a ton of new wildlife as well as plant life. According to the description, The Commonwealth is now crawling with more than 60 new mutants, over 30 new herbs and plants, and around 50 new species of fish.\nhttps://youtu.be/4bIR1BVoJOE?t=122\nIt's a veritable Garden of Eden, if said garden had been annihilated by an atomic explosion. The mod also allows you to \"earn new perks through gameplay, craft hundreds of new recipes and workshop objects, and much MUCH more!\"\nLife...uh...uh...uh...\nThe images on Nexus Mods–as well as the above video–give a brief overview of what you can expect from \"Mutant Menagerie.\" The fact that it contains so much new content should keep any dystopian-loving wannabee David Attenborough entertained for a while.\nFallout 4 is already pretty full of dangerous creatures, so a few more won't hurt. It's safe to assume that not all of these news ones are hostile, which means there'll be opportunities to just take in what remains of nature. Not to mention a chance to do some fishing. So...Fallout meets Stardew Valley, then?\nYou never know what you're going to get from the modding community.

          "description": "The amount of hype for Starfield easily rivals the biggest games of this year, which is really saying something. In fact, the anticipation is so enormous that Bethesda's upcoming sci-fi RPG is already topping the Steam charts.\nIf you head over to the website, you'll see that – at the time of writing – Starfield is currently at the number two spot on Steam's \"Top Sellers\" list. The only thing beating it is Valve's own Steam Deck device, which means the upcoming sci-fi RPG is number one in terms of actual games.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek3I6_9c58E&pp=ygUdc3RhcmZpZWxkIGxpdmUgYWN0aW9uIHRyYWlsZXI%3D\nAnybody who's even skimmed video game news lately could probably expect this development. Microsoft even reduced and then removed the Game Pass trial just ahead of the game's release, presumably to prevent eager people trying to play it on the cheap.\nHow it is at the top when it's not even out yet?\nSome may wonder how an unreleased game can dominate a chart that measures sales. However, it's likely that Steam is taking into account pre-orders.\nA quick look over on SteamDB shows that Starfield has approximately 342,000 owners and is the number one wishlisted game. To clarify, the information on the number of owners/players comes from PlayTracker, which does clarify that this insight is \"90% certain that estimates for this game are accurate within a 27% interval\".\nIn any case, Bethesda's upcoming title will inevitably continue to be a hot topic of discussion in the foreseeable future. We're still a week away from its release, so get used to seeing Starfield absolutely everywhere soon.\nStarfield is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.

          "description": "Atari has announced that they have a new entry in one of the oldest video game franchises around. Qomp2 is an upcoming game developed by Graphite Labs, and is the sequel to the shortform 2021 indie game, Qomp. It’s scheduled to hit PC, consoles, and mobile platforms in 2024.\nQomp was a spiritual success to 1972’s Pong, which is a game I probably don’t need to explain. Qomp is said to be the answer to the question, “What would happen if the pong ball escaped the paddles?” Well, I already know the answer to that. A point would be counted for the opposite side. It’s the point of the game.\nIf it was up to me, the ball would break out into the real world and discover that it has to get a job to afford to live. Then, it would struggle with a dead-end job, bills, loneliness, and an uncaring society. It would yearn to return to the Pong playing field.\nhttps://youtu.be/tah154H6i1o?feature=shared\nEmotions about balls\nHowever, in Qomp’s universe, the ball goes on an adventure through a deadly, minimalistic labyrinth. Minimalistic is pretty much the defining word here, as the challenges and movement are all based on a single button that changes the direction of the ball. It was also a short game, but it got some modest acclaim.\nQomp2 is bringing a second button to the input table. This one is a dash, and dashes make everything better. It promises “an enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly with simple animations, effects, and the game mechanics themselves.” That sounds like an indie game, yeah. Interestingly, though, I’m not sure if the original developers are involved. The first Qomp was a group of indie devs united by Stuffed Wombat, but the sequel is being done by frequent Atari collaborator Graphite Labs.\nQomp 2 will release on PC, consoles, and mobile platforms in 2024.\nThe post Qomp2 is Atari’s thrilling continuation of the Pong saga appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "NetherRealm has shown off some spiffy-looking pictures of the classic Living Forest level as it will appear in Mortal Kombat 1. Oh, gosh. I really hate the naming scheme of these games. At least the level looks great.\nThe Living Forest first appeared in 1993’s Mortal Kombat II. It’s one of the game’s most memorable locations. Not only is it haunting and surreal, visibly demonstrating the dark hazards of Outworld, but you could also catch a glimpse of secret characters Smoke and Jade peaking from behind the haunted trees.\nSince then, it has been a staple of the series, reappearing every few games to eat a few more Kombatants. The last we saw it in its full glory was in Mortal Kombat (2011). It appears that in Mortal Kombat 1 we'll be seeing two sides of the famous flora. The first side is the normal Living Forest. During the daytime, it actually looks pretty peaceful. Full of life and foliage. No doubt, it's benefited from Liu Kang's vision of a more peaceful universe.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399606\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via NetherRealm[/caption]\nBut then there's the other side: the Corrupted Forest. There’s green fire for some reason. The trees are all skull-like. But I think the nicest touch is that the undergrowth has lost all its leaves, so you have these skeletal shrubs jutting out on all sides. NetherRealm's Twitter post seems to suggest this part of the woods has been twisted by dark magic that has interrupted the slumber of the haunted trees.\nI definitely dig the dichotomy of the slumbering Living Forest and the dangerous-looking Corrupted Forest. One looks like a nice place for a walk, and the other looks like it will wreak havoc on your shins.\nMortal Kombat 1 comes out September 19, 2023 to PC, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.\nThe post The Living Forest has gotten a facelift in Mortal Kombat 1 with two levels appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Keep one hand on your wallet because Analogue is coming around with a special, glow-in-the-dark edition of their Analogue Pocket. This radiant version of the beefed-up Game Boy goes on sale on September 1st. There is no pre-order period, so you can expect it to ship by September 5th.\nThe Analogue Pocket is Analogue’s take on portable handhelds. It uses FPGA to create a hardware environment close to the Game Boy line of handhelds. There are also a number of adapters available that let you play games from other consoles, like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear. It also has various display modes to bring you closer to the original platforms without having to deal with all their warts.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399525\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Analogue[/caption]\nIt’s a pretty slick enthusiast-level device. I’m a bit envious since it’s sort of out of my price range. Also, I don’t really play handheld games that much, even though I’ve got a rather substantial library of titles. Still, if I had one, it would get used.\nThe glow-in-the-dark luxury edition is exactly that. The shell has been made of glow-in-the-dark plastic. It gets charged via available light sources and can apparently continuously glow for 8 hours, just like those plastic stars you have all over your bedroom ceiling. That’s all you get in terms of special features, which I feel is to be expected.\nThe Analogue Pocket Glow-in-the-Dark Limited edition will be available in “highly limited” numbers. It goes on sale September 1st at 8 am PDT for $249.99.\nThe post Stay up all night with a glow-in-the-dark Analogue Pocket appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Even though Starfield isn't out yet, there's been so much content and sneak previews for the game that some people are trying to piece it together ahead of schedule. For example, one person has decided to recreate an outpost styled after the upcoming sci-fi RPG in something other than Bethesda's in-house engine.\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, YouTuber Ghost Design recently uploaded footage from an Unreal Engine 5 project they've been working on. Spanning seven minutes, the footage shows what a typical Starfield outpost looks like when rendered in this software.\nhttps://youtu.be/Q67J3Aw_GEM\nUsing the free \"Mission to Minerva\" pack, Ghost Design has created what is essentially a facsimile of something that looks like it could be from Starfield itself. Only it's done in Unreal rather than Creation Engine.\nImagine the whole game in Unreal\nUE5 is currently one of (if not the) most powerful accessible game engines in the world. It's also one of the most popular, more so by the fact that any developer, big or small, can make use of it. Conversely, Bethesda's Creation Engine is proprietary, so only Bethesda games get made with it.\nWhile the use of Creation Engine for Starfield has likely drawn some criticism given how old it is, it's worth remembering that this is version 2.0. The studio has allegedly overhauled the software, bringing it more up-to-date, so games made it in should hopefully not have that Skyrim jank to them. From what we've all seen so far, it's fair to say that Starfield does look pretty. It's likely that official footage has been captured on PC using the most modern hardware around, so we'll see whether it looks as nice on a mid-range system or the Xbox Series S.\nStarfield will be releasing on September 6 for Series X|S and PC.\nThe post This is what Starfield could look like in Unreal Engine 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. \n\n\nHere are the PC specifications for Starfield: \nMinimum: \nOS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti\nDirectX: Version 12\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nRecommended: \nOS: Windows 10/11 with updates\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nAs you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. \nStarfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. \nWhile waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. \nAre you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6?

Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. \nAshmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx\nAugust 25, 2023\n“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment,\" says Ashmore in the video. \"Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will.\"\nAlan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest.

He’s draining the wealth and treasures around it to fund some new real estate (see: points of interest) around the island: Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate. \n\nEpic Games says these three locations are strongly defended bases with cameras, laser grids, and guards.

Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. \nThe game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: \n\n\n“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” \nThis sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” \n\nIf you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. \nThere’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. \nIn the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.\nAre you excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector?

The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche. \n\n\nNaturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. \nRoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "When Lil Gator Game launched last December, it captured our hearts as a fun, cozy adventure that drew obvious inspiration from the Legend of Zelda franchise. The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.\nThe free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.\nLil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC.

However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” \nThe PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. \n\nPSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. \nPlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.",

Additionally, players who watch the Marvel Snap category on Twitch will be eligible for drops starting today and running until August 29. \n\"Launching the game on PC has been a dream of ours for years now, and we've worked really hard to ensure it's an experience that players new and old are going to absolutely love,\" Brode said in a press release. \"This is especially an exciting time for the streaming community, who have welcomed Marvel Snap with open arms. The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC and we can't wait to see the epic streams on Twitch now that we're live.\"\nThe PC version includes a native widescreen format. You can see the animated reveal trailer debuted during today's livestream below.\n\n\nMarvel Snap was so well-received in 2022 that it was a rare free-to-play mobile title to land on Game Informer's Top 10 Games of the Year list.

Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as \"The Final Horizon\" update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.\n\n\nThe teaser itself doesn't give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.\nFor any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now. If you're itching for more Sonic news, check out the latest issue of our digital magazine to learn about Sonic Superstars. You can also learn about its newly announced release date.",

In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.\nSonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It's also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we've played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.\nThis announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.\n\n\nSonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming's most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20.

These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.\nYou can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. \nSimilar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals. \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.",

It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. \nCheck out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. \n“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” \n\nPearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. \nFor more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.\nAre you excited about Crimson Desert?

The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. \nAtari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. \n\n\nThe 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:\nAdventure\nCombat\nDodge ‘Em\nHaunted House\nMaze Craze\nMissle Command\nRealsports Volleyball\nSurround\nVideo Pinball\nYar’s Revenge\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\nThe Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99.
