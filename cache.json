He's also partial to a shipwreck or three. Adol's very first adventure in Ys I starts off with his boat being destroyed by a storm; Ark of Napishtim opens with Adol washed up on the beach; and in Lacrimosa of Dana, his ship is attacked by a sea serpent.\nAdol is hit by sea disasters so frequently that it's joked about both in-game and by the community; there's no way we're getting on a boat with Adol, even if it's just a raft. But in Ys X: Nordics, that's exactly what you have to do — not just get on the boat with him, but enhance it, control it, and crew it.

          "description": "Here be dragons.\nA couple of years ago, it was notable when the Switch remakes of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were developed not in-house by Game Freak, but by a smaller Japanese support studio called ILCA. That remake project was actually ILCA’s first crack at being the lead developer on a game, and it soon followed this up early last year with One Piece Odyssey, an original JRPG based on the long-running franchise about wacky pirates. Now this release has finally made its way over to the Switch, and we’re happy to report that it’s made the jump almost entirely intact. Though it’s taken a bit of a visual hit, One Piece Odyssey still proves to be an enjoyable and accessible release that's a welcome addition to the Switch’s considerable RPG library.\nThe narrative in One Piece Odyssey is a sort of ‘bottle episode’ that follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates crew after they shipwreck upon a mysterious island called Waford. Shortly after arriving, a mysterious figure takes away their power (cutely represented by everyone dropping from level 40 down to 1) and locks it away in various magical cubes scattered across the island. Even when they recover some of the cubes, the only way they can unlock the power contained within is through diving into illusory worlds crafted from their memories and reconquering trials they once faced, although events play out a little differently this time around because of how ‘fuzzy’ memory can be. The crew thus sets out through worlds based on the memories of some of their greatest struggles to reclaim their power and get to the bottom of what’s going on with this strange island.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After sinking 15 hours into The Gentlebros' latest adventure, it is safe to say everything about Cat Quest III is fantastic.\nThe adventure began with us choosing our feline Purrivateer and arriving in the Purribean, an archipelago filled with Pi-rats to defeat who are on the hunt for the North Star Treasure.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.\nRead more",

The blockbuster JRPG isn't out on PC yet, and developers Square Enix have not given a concrete release date for it, but this does seem to be prep work for the inevitable.

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.\nRead more",

It's got one of those \"painterly\" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as \"rotted\" and \"unhallowed\" and \"manky\". It's out on 6th September.

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.\nRead more",

Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.\nRead more",

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. Mortal Kombat 1 was marketed as a \"reboot\", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying \"I don't know, stick a multiverse in it.\" Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.\nRead more",

It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not that long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty \"developer deep dive video\", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.\nRead more",

          "description": "Horka polevila, ale žár nadšení Strahováků z techniky nepolevuje! Za poslední měsíc se stalo několik událostí doslova kosmického charakteru. Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!\r\n\r\nZa HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač \"zaseknout\" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.\r\n\r\nSoftware ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.\r\n\r\nJak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "This could quite well be my simplest review in the past twenty years of Phoronix. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.",

The storage required for Star Wars Outlaws, however, might be less than you'd expect; Ubisoft definitely used some Jedi mind tricks.\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws PC system requirements for minimum specs\n\n\nTo play this game from a galaxy far, far away at 1080p on low settings, you'll need at least 65GB of SSD storage space and some decent specs. Here is everything you'll require, according to the Epic Games Store:\n\n\n\nOS: Windows 10 with DirectX12\n\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or Intel Core i7-8700k\n\n\nMemory: 16GB (dual-channel mode)\n\n\nStorage: 65GB SSD\n\n\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6GB), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (6GB) or Intel Arc A750 (8GB) with REBAR ON\n\n\n\nThis will let you play the game at 30 frames per second on the low preset with the upscaler set to quality. You'll also require a Ubisoft account for Star Wars Outlaws to run on PC. Unfortunately, the game isn't on Steam as of the time of writing.\n\n\nRecommended specs for Star Wars Outlaws\n\n\nIf you're hoping to play Star Wars Outlaws as how the developers intended, you'll need the following specs:\n\n\n\nOS: Windows 10 with DirectX12\n\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x or Intel Core i5-10400\n\n\nMemory: 16GB (dual-channel mode)\n\n\nStorage: 65GB SSD\n\n\nGraphics: AMD RX 6700XT (12GB), NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060Ti (8GB)\n\n\n\nThese specs will let you play Star Wars Outlaws at 1080p with 60 frames per second. You'll have the high preset with the upscaler set to quality. \n\n\nAs games finally begin to be developed for current-gen consoles and PC rather than relying on the older generation, we're seeing higher graphics quality in modern gaming. Black Myth: Wukong, another game releasing in August, requires 16GB of RAM as well rather than the typical 8GB. \n\nThe post Star Wars Outlaws PC system requirements – minimum and recommended appeared first on Destructoid.",

Unlike Wood, Stone, or even Hay, Cattail Fluff doesn’t come to you in the course of your everyday tasks, so where do you get it?\n\n\nWhere to find Cattail Fluff in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nIf you’re looking for Cattail Fluff, you’ll need to head to the Eastern Road. This area is east of Mistria on the map, and also the location of the bridge where you begin your Mistrian adventure and later repair. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nCattail Fluffs can be found in the ponds and lakes towards the southern half of the Eastern Road map. Just like Water Chestnuts, they grow on the very edge of the water. They appear as Reeds, and when interacted with will produce the same amount of Cattail Fluff as there are heads on the Reeds. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCattail Fluff respawns daily, so make sure to visit the area regularly to build up a hoard for all your crafting purposes. Alternatively, if you have a surplus of Tesserae, you can always buy Cattail Fluff from Balor's Wagon for 25 Tesserae each.\n\n\nHow to use Cattail Fluff in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you’ve got a bunch of Cattail Fluff stocked up, you can head to your nearest Crafting Bench. There’s one in town outside the Bell Tower, and another at the Carpenters Shop, or you can purchase one to have on your farm from the latter as well. \n\n\nCattail Fluff is used to make any furniture with padding. This includes beds, chairs, and rugs. You’ll need a varying amount, depending on which item you’re wanting to craft, with the minimum amount being three in order to make a Worn Bed. \n\nThe post How to get Cattail Fluff in Fields of Mistria appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here are all the materials you'll need to add this support character to your Descendant list.\n\n\nNexon Games released The First Descendant 1.0.5 update on July 31 where Luna is one of the characters introduced alongside Ultimate Valby. She is a Non-attribution character who can grant various effects to her allies using her music.\n\n\nHow to get Luna in The First Descendant\n\n\nYou can get Luna in two ways: by spending 900 Caliber or crafting her.\n\n\nThe first method is the fastest way to get her in the game but it will cost you money. Since the in-game store doesn't give you the option to purchase 900 Caliber, you'll need to purchase 1060 Caliber which will ultimately cost you $19.99.\n\n\nThe second way to get her is by crafting. Like all other Descendants, this method is time-consuming and requires you to collect Research Materials and Gold.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to craft Luna in The First Descendant\n\n\nSpeak to Magister Anais in Albion to craft Luna and for that, you've to collect all the necessary materials first.

This will initiate Luna's research process. You'll need an additional 400,000 Gold and wait for 16 hours for the entire research process to complete.\n\n\nLuna is the 15th Descendant to be added to the roster with the Synthesizer Gun being her trademark weapon.\n\nThe post How to unlock Luna in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just like in real life, speed is the best friend of wide receiver (WR) in College Football 25. The faster they are on the ground, the harder it's going to be for any defender to keep pace as they run their routes or burn rubber towards the end zone.\n\n\nSure, they will need to be good at jumping and catching the ball, but that's of little use if they can't use their ability to run. Let's take a look at the ten fastest WRs on the default roster.\n\n\n10 WRs in College Football 25 with the highest speed\n\n\nDetermining the fastest WRs is easy, thanks to the SPD rating. The SPD rating is a direct reflection of how fast an athlete will be on the field. I have also added the agility stat on the side (which hasn't been used as judgment), as it's another critical area for the wide receiver position.\n\n\nName\nSPD\nOVR\nAGI\n\n\nNyck Harbor\n99\n82\n88\n\n\nArian Smith\n98\n77\n93\n\n\nMonaray Baldwin\n98\n83\n96\n\n\nJordan Anthony\n98\n75\n96\n\n\nBarion Brown\n98\n85\n93\n\n\nJelani Watkins\n98\n72\n93\n\n\nCJ Smith\n98\n76\n86\n\n\nIsaiah Bond\n98\n88\n94\n\n\nAnthony Evans III\n98\n73\n94\n\n\nChe Nwabuko\n98\n71\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WR position is at a tricky spot in College Football 25 when it comes to speed. On the one hand, several athletes are fast, with Nyck Harbor being the fastest of the lot. In fact, he's the only WR with a SPD rating of 99. On the other hand, most of the names on this list don't have a notable OVR rating.\n\n\nThe most all-rounded athlete on this list is Texas' Isaiah Bond. With a SPD rating of 98 and an OVR of 88, he's a cut above the remaining names on the list. Do note that there are more athletes with 98 SPD in the game, but they haven't been placed here due to having lower OVR ratings.\n\nThe post 10 fastest WRs in College Football 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Along with Bloober Team finally getting ready to launch the remake of Silent Hill 2, Saber Interactive has also given us the launch date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.\n\n\nIn the most recent trailer, we're being told that the horror adaptation will be coming to us on October 17. That's just a couple of weeks before the Spooky Season, which is always a bit of a cliché, but it does make sense.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer itself is chock-full of the usual teases and snippets of gameplay. I certainly don't want to get ahead of myself given the general reputation of video game movie tie-ins, but The Road Ahead does look like it has a lot of potential.\n\n\nTo quietly go\n\n\nTaking A Quiet Place's concept of remaining silent so as not to be detected by monsters should – on paper at least – translate well to the gaming sphere. Anyone who's ever played a survival horror game where the object is to avoid combat and enemy encounters knows all too well how tense things can get.\n\n\nAs for The Road Ahead itself, it's not a straight-up adaptation of the films. It boasts its own storyline inspired by its cinematic counterpart, although a previous trailer shows there may be some story elements that have been lifted from the first movie.\n\n\nIn any case, I don't want to immediately get my hopes up, but I can only contain any vague sense of excitement for so long. I am but human, after all.\n\nThe post A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is releasing this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game's new Escalation of Freedom update has only just come out, and the players have already figured out that it's loaded with a few non-insignificant nerfs to flame-based weapons, such as the incendiary Breaker shotgun and the flamethrower, among others.\n\n\nMore specifically, the community feels that the Escalation of Freedom update has essentially reneged the developer Arrowhead Games' prior promise to more mindfully balance weapons. The flamethrower, for one, can no longer effectively take down armored enemies (like the infamously annoying Charger), and the incendiary Breaker has lost two full magazines' worth of spare ammo in an attempt to make it a less popular choice on Terminid missions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Helldivers 2 community is not happy with…",

The Narrows are to the left of the main Mistria location, on the same pathway as the Museum and Mines. The Water Chestnuts primarily spawn in the river at the bottom.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo harvest Water Chestnuts, look for small green sprouts in the water and approach them closely.

It replenishes health and stamina by 12, which will undoubtedly be helpful when you're stuck in the mines. Fortunately, the Wild Berries are much easier to find, as they can be picked from bushes throughout the map.\n\n\nTo collect more Water Chestnuts in Fields of Mistria, you'll need to wait for them to respawn near the bridge.

Those who pre-order will get a Combustion Blaster and an Obi-Wan-inspired robe. \n\n\n\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor first launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA App on April 28, 2023. It essentially took what 2019's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order offered and gave us way more of the good stuff. \n\n\nSpeaking of good stuff, Respawn is hoping to inject more of it into the PC port. When it initially launched, it was buggy and messed up enough to warrant an apology. Improvements have been made since, and the latest press release says more enhancements are on the way \"in the coming weeks.\"\n\n\nThe upcoming patch promises updates to technical performance, controls, and other features. Players can also look forward to \"a variety of quality-of-life improvements\" when the fixes go live. Here's hoping everything goes smoothly both for the PC version and the previous-gen consoles, which have a pretty beefy game on their hands with this one. \n\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor squeezes onto PS4, Xbox One on September 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've begun the Shards Request mission, you'll likely be puzzled by the resource's mysterious locations. They aren't exactly out in the open like other items, given that they must be unearthed with specific tools. So, if you want to complete the quest and earn crafting materials, here's how to get Shards in Fields of Mistria.\n\n\nWhere to find Shards and Dig Sites in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nUse your shovel on a Dig Site to get Shards in the Fields of Mistria. If you haven't obtained this tool yet, the General Store sells a Worn Shovel for 500 Tesserae. I've had the most luck finding the Shards at the Western Ruins site, located to the left of the Narrows.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGo to the south side of the Western Ruins to find an archeology area. You should see a dig spot where you'll need to use your shovel. However, keep in mind that Shards don't always drop, and you may end up with another item instead.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOne Dig Site will spawn at the Western Ruins daily, so check back on this destination for more Shards. If you want to increase the digging spots there, speak to Caldarus (the dragon statue) and unlock the Western Ruins Scholar perk. It will spawn an additional spot to farm more resources. \n\n\nShards may appear in other areas, like the mines, whenever there's a Dig Site to uncover. I haven't had much luck outside of the Western Ruins, but it could still be possible. The material can also be used for crafting, along with the Shards Request. I suggest saving some for yourself for a future build in case it's needed again.\n\nThe post How to get Shards in Fields of Mistria appeared first on Destructoid.",
