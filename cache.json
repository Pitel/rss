Instead, you are playing as the person drawing them, whether they are a knight engaging in scholarly pursuits or a monk spending their days painstakingly recreating a single copy of an important tome.

          "description": "Baldur's Gate 3's latest update has, as per most of their updates, a colossal number of improvements. Notably, there are new animations for folks who hunker down in your camp and a speedier way to dismiss unwanted companions. But most importantly of all, the smooching has been improved tenfold for fans of romance, or voyeurs who relish virtual characters trading saliva.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.\nThis might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.\nRead more",

          "description": "Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.\nBut nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.\nWhile Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.\n Read more",

          "description": "If you've been enjoying the excellent Cobalt Core as part of this month's RPS Game Club, you may well have stumbled into Soggins the frog along your travels. Running into this hapless buffoon is always a delight in Cobalt Core, as he's one of the few special characters who doesn't instantly attack you on sight. Rather, the task here is always to try and save him from his own idiocy - namely, his malfunctioning ship that keeps firing his missiles right back toward him. He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you. \nRead more",

The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara's OG adventures from the late 90s, and I'm not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.\nRead more",

Ordered by the number of unique players that spent time with them during Next Fest proper (meaning all those early demo plays from earlier in the month haven't been counted), the most popular game of the lot was one that was only formally announced right at the end of January. So congratulations Dungeonborne - your blend of PvPvE dungeon crawling and fantasy skelly monsters clearly struck a chord with this year's Next Festers. \nRead more",

It would be easy to look at this spin-off and question why it takes the co-op out of one of the best co-op games on PC, or to shovel it aside as a cynical attempt at latching onto the popularity of autoshooters/Survivors-likes/bullet heavens (delete as preferred). But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.\nRead more",

          "description": "By now you'll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games' upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.\nWith so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.\nRead more",

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. \r\n\n\r\nOh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there!

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced \"gaslamp fantasy\" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.\nLast week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go.\" And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. \nThe biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair.

Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for \"grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series\" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.\nBanishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace \"treasure\" with \"ghosts\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. \"Procgen\" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a \"hand-made\" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. \r\n\n\r\nOne is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of \"Fae\" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There's been frequent disconnects, matchmaking issues, and post-game rewards not showing up for some folks. But Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt has offered some comfort, saying that they've popped three hotfixes live to fix some of these issues.\nRead more",

Why is this of interest to us, a PC gaming site? Well, because console gaming can't help but shape the weather for PC gaming; more specifically, Microsoft's alleged multiplatform ambitions seem to reflect the plateauing of Game Pass subscription growth, which has become the cornerstone of the Xbox biz.\n  \nRead more",

Not only is it one of the most visually vibrant games of the year so far with its neon colour palette that's an instant-KO-to-my-eyeballs, but the way it twists and rewires core tenets of the Metroidvania rulebook also make it one of the boldest and most daring examples of its genre. I'll say it now: it doesn't always stick the landing. But if there's one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it's that it's always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.\nRead more",

Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. \nBut one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is \"probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that.\" Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape.

          "description": "When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.\nSome games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of \"living, breathing\" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, \"gardenvania\" - which launches next week.\n Read more",

          "description": "In an upsetting confirmation that February is in fact winter (and that the year doesn't just start with summer like my brain thinks it should) publisher Whitethorn Games held a 2024 Winter Showcase, where they revealed the existance of a game that answers the question \"what if the slimes in Slime Rancher were in mortal peril, and had swords?\". The answer is apparently \"be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike\". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.\nYou know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love. I am heartened to know it is coming out really quite soon - April 9th. A mere two months from now!\nRead more",

Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own \"repercussions\", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration. \nRead more",

          "description": "Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from \"literally about 3 ever made\" to \"does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter\". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense \"survive the ordeal\" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.\nBut it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment.

The studio's community manager, Bucky, seems to feel the same if their recent Twitter post is anything to go by. \n\n\nIt's not very often that a game, especially one from a smaller studio, becomes as much of an overnight success as Palworld did.

          "description": "Petroglyph has announced that the sequel to 2016’s 8-Bit Armies, titled 9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far, will release into PC Early Access on February 23.\n\n\nThe use of 8-Bit in describing indie games that use either a voxel or pixel art style has always irked me. It’s less common now, but it was very popular as the retro gamer identity started to take hold. A pet peeve is all. However, Petroglyph has been in my mind since I learned they are still updating 2006’s Star Wars: Empire at War. That kind of love and commitment toward their community is laudable.\n\n\n\n\n9-Bit Armies describes itself as and easy to learn, difficult-to-master real-time strategy game. While I’m not a fan of the voxel art style, it touts two-player cooperative campaigns, maps that are 400% bigger than the original, and naval warfare. You can also build and destroy bridges, which may not sound very exciting, but bridges have extreme strategic importance in real wars, and this rarely gets translated into strategy games.\n\n\nIn terms of its Early Access release, Petroglyph says, “The core game is largely in place, with both factions fully playable and a full campaign to play through.” The goal of Early Access is to open it to a larger player base and collect feedback to improve it on top of just adding content.\n\n\n9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far releases on PC Early Access on February 23, 2024.\n\nThe post Petroglyph’s 9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far launches into Early Access on February 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I’ve actually asked people close to me if they even know the rules, and no one does. Here’s my guess based on reading Life, the Universe and Everything: A guy throws a ball at a wooden block that is held up by three short poles. A guy with a flat cudgel tries to prevent the ball from hitting the structure and knocking the block from the top of it. However, there are a bunch of other guys surrounding this duel, and I have no idea what they do.\n\n\nThat’s my guess at how Cricket is played.\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, it doesn’t look like I need to know the rules for Cricket Through the Ages, a game that celebrates the extensive history of the sport. It seems to be aiming to give a deep dive into the sport and should teach me everything I need to know. It looks like one of those wacky physics-driven games that are intentionally difficult to control. People are throwing things at each other. One of the scenes actually looks like what I think the sport looks like, but they’re playing with a beach ball.\n\n\nIt looks fun. The press release I have says that it uses a “simple, one-button control scheme.” It has six game modes and can be played by yourself or against your most hated enemy. They also promise that you will, \"learn about the totally real history of cricket. You won’t believe it.\"\n\n\nCricket Through the Ages was previously only available as part of the Apple Arcade service on iOS, but is now coming to real video game devices. It releases on PC and Switch on March 1, 2024.\n\nThe post Devolver published Cricket Through the Ages is coming to PC and Switch March 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Part of the run up is a collaboration with actor David Harbour, who worked with developer Eleventh Hour to create an in-game item for Last Epoch.\n\n\nDavid Harbour is pretty much a household name, at this point. If you’re unsure who I’m talking about, you’ll undoubtedly know him as Jim Hopper from Stranger Things, but he has had starring roles in everything from blockbuster movies like Hellboy to Theatre plays like Hamlet. And in games, he’s lending his voice as Edward Carnby in the 2024 remake of Alone in the Dark. \n\n\nHarbour is a lifelong gamer, having previously revealed that he plays World of Warcraft, so his Instagram post explaining his love for Last Epoch shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. \n\n\n\n\nWhile disclosing that the post is indeed a hashtag-ad, Harbour goes on to explain his love for Last Epoch, thanking the team at Eleventh Hour for allowing him to collaborate with them on the in-game item. Although he offers no specific details about the item, Harbour concluded the post by promising to share more as soon as he could before encouraging people to buy the game before its release. \n\n\n\n\nEleventh Hour took the time to comment on David’s post, saying “Just like in this post, when we met David we could all feel the genuine passion he had for the game and the collaboration.

Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios announced via Twitter that a bonus XP weekend will be in effect for the frantic third-person shooter effective immediately. The bonus XP will last through the end of February 18 and will grant all players XP and Requisition at a 50% multiplier on top of your base mission score.\n\n\n\n\nA true Hell\n\n\nAccording to Deputy Game Director Sagar Beroshi, a current problem is causing some player rewards to not pay out properly upon mission completion. A fix is in the works, but the event is intended to help alleviate the impact going into the weekend.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Helldivers 2 has had somewhat of a rocky launch, primarily with matchmaking and server stability. But a recent patch seems to have fixed a lot of the issues, and even with them, diving is just so damn fun.

Since launch, some players have reported issues with strangers infiltrating their servers, destroying their bases, and even preventing access to servers entirely. \n\n\nPocketpair have today released a statement on Twitter addressing these issues and outlining measures that they plan to introduce to combat cheaters trying to spoil other players enjoyment of the game, stating: “As a company, we do not tolerate any fraudulent activity or cheating, and we are working on measures to deal with it strictly and as a priority.”\n\n\n\n\nThe first measure outlined in the Twitter post is the introduction of a player list on multiplayer servers, allowing players and hosts to identify uninvited players and potentially boot them from the server. The hope is that this will also allow for players to receive suspensions by the development team in the event of dishonorable gameplay. \n\n\nPocketpair are also planning to introduce an ‘external anti-cheat solution’, although they don’t name software or give details as to how this would work, in order to ‘take measures against particularly frequent fraudulent activities and cheating’. They do note that this feature will be optional for those who play on community servers and those who play single player and co-op.\n\n\nThey also noted that while the team try to deal with issues on a daily basis, sometimes there are cases where they are unable to keep up and they apologized for this before going on to say that they’re working hard to get the game back to a state which allows players to enjoy it comfortably.\n\nThe post Pocketpair is working to address cheating on Palworld servers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Plenty has been said about Destiny 2's many, many ups and downs in the year of Lightfall. Even though Bungie hasn't prepared the strongest of send-offs with the Season of the Wish, better updates are on the way, and Update 7.3.5, in particular, could be an interesting showpiece.\n\n\nMore specifically, Bungie's latest This Week in Destiny blog specifically outlines Update 7.3.5, which is due to launch on March 5, with sandbox changes taking the most of the limelight. Exotics such as the Manticore SMG and the Vex Mythoclast fusion rifle are being (slightly) buffed, for example, and almost every weapon class is getting a tweak of this or that kind. Further, there are big PvP changes in tow, with the nerf to the infamously powerful Threaded Specter Warlock subclass being particularly notable.\n\n\n…",

          "description": "As influential as the original Doom games are, it'd be interesting to know how much they'd stand the ravages of time were it not for modding and unusual ports. It set the building blocks for the FPS genre back in the day, but the fact that people continue to tweak the original formula shows just how much of an impact the series has had these past 30 years.\n\n\nSometimes mods will even incorporate other horror franchises. Take this one that mixed Doom with Friday The 13th. Inspired. Now, here's one for us Alien lovers, in which the iconic Xenomorph creatures have made their way into id Software's classic shooters.\n\n\nImage via SlegInfantryman/ModDB.\n\n\nBrought to us by ModDB user SlegInfantryman, \"Xenomorph Infestation\" is an upcoming mod for both Doom and its sequel featuring a \"fully functioning Xenomorph hive that will grow organically featuring the whole life cycle.\" We can see how the images bring the two ideas together.\n\n\nNow we just need Ripley fighting imps\n\n\nAt the moment, the mod is in alpha stage, with no finalized release date yet. SlegInfantryman has said it's more for testing at this point, but it's available to download as a demo.\n\n\nHere's what they have to say about it in response to a comment on the mod page:\n\n\n\nThis is the alpha version which I was mainly using to test and make sure the Xenomorphs functioned correctly in infesting maps. If you run the Xenomorph infestation.pk3 alongside one of the other pk3 files included, you can watch them take over a map.\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, it's a bit of fun to see them running around like excitable kittens in the world of Doom. There seems to be quite a few of these mods already, which suggests the two franchises are just natural bed fellows.\n\nThe post Xenomorphs in classic Doom?

According to the item description, Apocalyptic Charades was character locked. \n\n\nThis means that the emote would only be usable by one character associated with the buyer's account, something that left many disappointed, considering the fact that FFXIV allows you to have multiple characters. For $350 dollars, it seems pretty fair to assume it's account-wide.\n\n\nIt wasn’t altogether surprising, though.

Beyond just kissing, the patch notes highlight they’ve “improved” some of the final cinematics to “better reflect the connection between players and their partners.” Ladies.\n\n\nThere are some smaller tweaks as well, but the other big ones for me are improved idle camp animations and better speaker prioritization in dialogue.

          "description": "Last year's Alan Wake 2 was a triumph, not only in the survival horror genre but in AAA gaming in general. Given the high praise, it's no wonder we declared it one of our favorite games of 2023. And for good reason, too.\n\n\nAs well as great reviews all around, the Alan Wake follow-up has also been selling well. According to developer Remedy Entertainment, the long-awaited sequel has sold 1.3 million units, as of February 2024. A post on the developer's website says it's the fastest-selling game the company has ever released \"so far.\"\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, it's not been out for too long, so time will tell how big the game can get in terms of sales, especially once DLC hits. By comparison, Control has sold over four million units since it launched in 2019. However, AW2 has sold \"over 50% more copies and over three times more digital copies in its first two months\" than that.\n\n\nAwards, they keep a-comin'\n\n\nOn top of this, Remedy was proud to announce that Alan Wake 2 recently received the DICE Award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction.\" That's one more accolade to be thrown on the pile, right next to such wins as \"Critics Choice Award\" at Golden Joystick, \"Best Direction\" and \"Best Narrative\" at The Game Awards 2023, as well as some others.\n\n\nSelling 1.3 million units in just a couple of months is mighty impressive, even if you take into account the fact that the game was launched not long before the holidays.\n\n\nOf course, we also need to consider that Alan Wake 2 is a digital-only release. Whether you agreed with that decision or not, one can't help but wonder how many more could have been sold by now if there was a physical copy available as well.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 is Remedy’s fastest-selling game ‘so far’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Plenty of praise has been already directed at Arrowhead Studios' latest flagship release, Helldivers 2, but the fact of the matter is that the game is only just kicking off. Notably, the cyborg Automaton faction has mounted its first full-fledged onslaught in Helldivers 2, and it's a wildly different sort of battlefield.\n\n\nWhile Helldivers 2's Terminids are a swarm of angry, violent bugs (that can be harvested for fuel, coincidentally), the Automatons are a terrifying army of angry, violent Terminators. Well-organized and properly equipped, Automaton forces are now in the limelight, and the community is coming to terms with the new war front by formulating new tactics and, of course, sharing memes.\n\n\n\n\nHelldivers 2's Automaton faction is something else entirely\n\n\nBroadly speaking, if you t…",

          "description": "It's been over ten years since the release of EA Sports' NCAA Football 14. The college football fanbase has been rabid for its reintroduction for years. They'll get their first look at the series' evolution soon. \n\n\nThe official EA Sports College Football X account updated its profile today to reveal the franchise's new logo. Alongside that, we also got a College Football 25 teaser trailer that announced the game would be fully revealed in May.\n\n\n\n\nWe've known since November that EA was targeting this summer for College Football 25's release. However, after previous delays, fans may have been speculative as to whether the college football sim could actually meet its target. Those same fans were playfully called out in today's College Football 25 teaser. \"Yeah, it's really happening.\"\n\n\nEA's NCAA series was beloved during its run. Many football fans considered the franchise to be superior to its sister series, Madden. Unfortunately, due to complications in college sports around name, image, and likeness, EA shelved it following the release of NCAA Football 14.\n\n\nThe NCAA series was renowned for nailing the authentic atmosphere of college football. The fans, the mascots, the rivalries, the stadiums, all of it faithfully recreated in video game form. The Collge Football 25 teaser trailer seems to hit on all those nostalgic notes, assuring returning fans that this reincarnation will be worth the patience.\n\n\nWith a reveal in May and release in the summer, we won't have to wait much longer to find out. \n\nThe post EA College Football 25 teaser declares for a May reveal appeared first on Destructoid.",

One of the features they tout is that Omega enables people to play for free, and in this business, that can mean a lot of things. What is clear is that this isn’t No Man’s Sky going completely free-to-play. So, we can scratch that off.\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of the patch notes page, Hello Games notes the update “invites everybody to embark upon a new shared interstellar expedition entirely for free, whether they already own No Man’s Sky or not.” That sounds like there’s a separate mode that is available to play for free as maybe a trial or demo.\n\n\nHowever, further down, it says, “From 14…",

          "description": "The \"bullet heaven\" genre was not something I seriously encountered until I started playing Vampire Survivors. It's got that dopamine hit that comes when you're the one the enemies have to watch out for. But if you want something that's less about castles and spells and more about basic shapes in space, Geometry Survivor is where it's at.\n\n\nAs noted by Gaming on Linux, this is an upcoming rogue-like indie game with the timed, survival notions of something like Vampire Survivors, but with a look that's closer to the old Xbox Live Arcade release Geometry Wars.\n\n\n\n\nIn this instance, you take on the role of a \"ship,\" in which you can unlock upgrades so you can fight wave after wave of incoming enemies. It's scheduled to release February 22 on Steam. I've already wishlisted it.\n\n\nOoh, it's all bright and colorful!\n\n\nHere's a quick rundown on what you can expect in Geometry Survivor:\n\n\n\nOne hand gameplay: Use just one hand to control the direction of your ship\n\n\nAuto-Shooter: Your weapons fire automatically, letting you concentrate on staying alive\n\n\nWeapons: Each run allows you to get a unique combination of weapons\n\n\nCredits: Earn credits and permanently unlock new upgrades\n\n\nEnemies: Enjoy the multitude of enemies each with their own AI\n\n\n20 minutes of intense gameplay\n\n\nRetro visuals and music straight from the 80s\n\n\nDelicious gameplay!\n\n\n\nI've never considered something that may have \"delicious gameplay\" before: but I guess all those shapes and vibrant colors do have a tasty quality about them.\n\n\nHonestly, my girlfriend and I have been hooked on Vampire Survivors, having only really been told about it a few weeks back. Maybe I'm late to the genre, but Geometry Survivor is definitely one that I could be adding to my collection. I'm open to other recommendations, as well.\n\nThe post Geometry Survivor is like if Geometry Wars and Vampire Survivors got together appeared first on Destructoid.",

As part of the said update, the studio is introducing a new mob for when you think the game isn't hostile enough.\n\n\nSay hello to the bogged. This is a skeletal creature that fires poison-tipped arrows. A recent post on the Minecraft website puts a little bit of a lovey-dovey spin on the mob. Because it was announced on Valentine's Day.\n\n\n\n\nWith its green, gooey look and vacant eyes, the bogged is actually a variant on the classic skeleton and, as the name implies, can be found in the more swampy areas of the game.\n\n\nWhen can I give it a hug?\n\n\nThe bogged is set to come out with the 1.21 update (which is due sometime this year), but you can test it now in snapshots, which are essentially beta tests for new Minecraft features. The post gives some instructions:\n\n\n\nTo install a snapshot, open up the Minecraft Launcher and enable snapshots in the \"Installations\" tab. To enable preview/beta for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, then follow these instructions.\n\n\n\n\nAs of late 2023, the game has sold over 300 million copies since it launched in 2011 (or 2009 if you're counting the alpha build). It's no secret that it's been one of the most successful releases in gaming history, and the fact that it's still going today is pretty gnarly stuff.\n\n\nIt's been a good while since I was sucked back into Minecraft's world. Not sure whether a new green enemy is enough to entice me back in. But that could be because I've recently got back into No Man's Sky. That's eating into a lot of my downtime at the minute.\n\nThe post Minecraft introduces new undead mobs called ‘the bogged’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it.

They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.\nAccording to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.\nSpencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.\nBond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.\n\n\nThe podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.",

Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.\nThe video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. \n\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. \nWith Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). \nWe don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.",

Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. \nThe video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.\n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.",

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the \"where\" and \"when\": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.\nWhen the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.\nWhat do you think the future of Xbox looks like?

This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf.

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.\nWhile 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.\nThe developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.\nAfter 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat.

It also wrote, \"The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!\" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.\nFor more on Evil Empire, you can read Game Informer's impressions of the Dead Cells: Return to Castelvania DLC.",

That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for.

Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.",

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer.

Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.\n\n\nThe series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+.

From there, you travel to Junon, a vast open area in the shadow of Shinra's military; this area also features chocobos that can climb up cliffsides.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do.

Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.\nFor more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.\nWhat do you think Xbox will announce next week?

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below. \nPart 1 - Plenty of Time\nPart 2 - The Bear\nPart 3 - Deku Ball Z\nPart 4 - Pig Out\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
