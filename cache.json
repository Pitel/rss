The exceptional RPG remake from Square Enix has crashed out of the top 40 altogether, marking a stark difference between audiences' tastes in the UK when compared to Japan.

Other details are slim, but Koei Tecmo has shed a little more light on the upcoming project in a recent tweet.\nLet's get the biggie out of the way first: Atelier Resleriana will not include a gacha system. The game's mobile predecessor, Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator, was guilty of relying perhaps a little too heavily on pull rates and paid-only options, so it's nice to hear that we'll see no such systems in the console spin-off.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

April Fools’ Day 2024 saw plenty of enticing fake announcements, but there was one smaller prank nestled among the big hitters that stung just a little bit extra. Developer Inti Creates, known for games like Blaster Master Zero and Azure Striker Gunvolt, took to social media that fateful day to unveil Divine Dynamo Flamefrit: an all-new, top-down, action-adventure, dungeon-crawler game.\nSuffice it to say, it left quite the strong impression with its stylish 16-bit graphics, its flashy combat, and, most importantly, its utter devotion to replicating the cheesy aesthetic of '80s and '90s-era shonen anime. While the trailer was clearly marked as an April Fools’ Day joke, that didn’t stop fans from letting Inti Creates know that this was a game they wanted to actually play. Fortunately, the developer made it happen. Once just an intricately crafted joke, Divine Dynamo Flamefrit is now out in a fully playable form — and it’s quite the enjoyable little romp.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.\n$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.\nRead more",

The orthodox interpretation is that \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a \"shotgun\" instead of the \"scissors\". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!\nThe sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials.

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.\nRead more",

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. \nJorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a \"solar-powered\" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.\n Read more",

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices.

All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head.

These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: \"ah, that was good.\"\nSo what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot.

It's like the \"glass half empty\" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the \"bar\", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.\nIn this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. \"A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please,\" I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

          "description": "In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say \"lol, it me\" with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter \"ugh, it me\" and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. \nThere is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.\nRead more",

He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.\r\n\nIt’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

We absolutely can’t be having that.\nThis is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.\nRead more",

          "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to get some major new features when it is eventually released, and a new patented technology could make the handheld compatible with smartphone devices.\n\n\nAs originally reported by Clawsomegamer, Nintendo has filed for a new tech patent that will allow its console to work seamlessly with mobile phones. While it's hard to estimate how exactly this technology will work, it seems likely that smartphone devices could well become an external tool for the Switch 2.\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2's patented technology could be a major breakthrough\n\n\nIt seems that Nintendo is trying to create a central gaming ecosystem for its upcoming console. While you'll still require the handheld to play your games, the in-development technology will allow you to pair it with your smartphones and tablets.\n\n\nThe system is expected to work like PlayStation's QR code system. A QR code will be shown on your Nintendo Switch 2 screen, and any device you use for a scan will connect automatically to your Nintendo console.\n\n\nOnce connected, the possibilities are endless. The paired smartphone could act as a second controller, which would be great for having multiplayer sessions with your friends. No longer will the two of you need to own a Nintendo console, and it could be a great way for the Japanese gaming giant to advertise its products. After all, what can be better than having one of your customers show their cool Pokemon and Mario titles to their friends at a birthday party!\n\n\nThe scope isn't only limited to expanding Nintendo's ecosystem to devices outside its consoles. Having a tablet act as the second screen can be immensely useful, especially if you have bigger devices.\n\n\nThat said, it isn't clear if the technology will be immediately available in the Nintendo Switch 2. If it does, it surely is going to be a wonderful innovation on Nintendo's part.\n\nThe post Nintendo Switch 2’s new patented technology could turn your smartphones into a controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

For those who don't feel like looking at a calendar, that means you have a week to figure out if you want to grab the RPG epic Metaphor: ReFantazio at 25% off (hint: you probably do). That's about how much time you have to check out the Steam Deck, which is also on sale. You can pick up the 512GB version for 25% off.\n\n\nImage via Valve\n\n\nThere are plenty of other 2024 hits on sale starting today. Another Crab's Treasure is a Soulslike indie gem starring a crab trying to get his shell back — it's 34% off today. One of the year's best games is Helldivers 2 (I'm biased), nominated for four awards at The Game Awards 2024. You can learn what the buzz is about and spread some sweet liberty after picking it up for 20% off. \n\n\nSpeaking of best games, starting today, you can nominate your favorite games of 2024 for the annual Steam Awards.

The games are Stick It to the Stickman, Baby Steps, and Skate Story. They’re now all coming in 2025. Maybe.\n\n\nI feel like patting myself on the back, because when the Devolver Delayed Awards 2024 stream was announced, those are the games I guessed. But then I realized that I guessed them by going into Steam, looking at what games Devolver still has slated for 2024, and listing them off. There was absolutely no guesswork there, so I should probably have a little modesty.\n\n\nHowever, I’d like to point out that Stick It to the Stickman and Skate Story are both returning champions from the Devolver Delayed 2023 stream. At this point, they might as well keep delaying them for the shower of accolades it nets them every year.\n\n\nI don’t really have a horse in this race. I’m rarely disappointed by delays these days because I’ve always got too much to play, both at the present and in the future. And the only game of the three delayed I’m really all that interested in is Skate Story. That’s because I like Skate. and this game is clearly trying to do something neat with the formula. However, it’s not, like, at the top of my priorities. If it’s at the top of your priorities: bummer.\n\n\nStick It to the Stickman, Baby Steps, and Skate Story are all set to release sometime in 2025.

The new feature promises a refreshing take on the game, along with a Night Ops Launch trailer that gives us a sneak peek.\n\n\nThe latest trailer vividly captures the danger that lurks in the night, with visuals shrouded in darkness. I've experienced this firsthand in-game, and I can tell you, it's an intense experience. The realism is so palpable that I've often found myself wandering aimlessly, only to be jump scared by an enemy. It's terrifying, but at least it keeps up with Gray Zone Warfare's realism aspect.\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, thanks to the variety of Night Vision Goggles, things won't always feel so helpless in the dark.

          "description": "Popular indie games Palworld and Terraria will have some crossover content next year in Palworld. Very few details have been shared about the tie-in, but we know information will be coming soon.\n\n\nPalworld Terraria crossover is incoming\n\n\nViewed over 1.8 million times on X since the Tuesday announcement, the official Palworld social media account posted a crossover image. It has the Terraria Guy and Palworld's main character shaking hands. Not much else is known other than we're getting information \"coming soon.\" \n\n\nPalworld also says that there will be at least one more update before the end of the year. This time, it says news about the next update will be coming \"very soon.\" \n\n\n\n\nTerraria is no stranger to crossovers. Don't Starve Together has the Eye of Terror, new bosses, and a bunch of new skins inspired by Terraria, while Terraria received one new boss and plenty of items based on the Klei property. Terraria also received Stardew Valley-based content, such as the Blue Chicken and Stardrop, while Stardew Valley implemented the Meowmere sword. \n\n\nBased on past history, it's likely we'll see Terraria elements in Palworld, and vice versa. Based on the art, we could see Cattiva, Depresso, and Chillet in the world of Terraria. On the other hand, perhaps some weapons and crafting items could be craftable in Palworld. \n\n\nImage via Pocketpair\n\n\nThis is the first good news for Palworld fans for a while. The game's developer, Pocketpair, has been sued by The Pokémon Company. The plaintiff claims that Pocketpair has infringed on three patents. It's been reported that the Pal Sphere system veers too close to a Pokéball. \n\nThe post Palworld x Terraria update is coming in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk!

If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly.

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

Což je diametrální rozdíl oproti skvěle promyšlenému \"Tísňovému volání\". (Ilča 50 %)",

Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)",

          "description": "Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.\n\n\nExistuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně \"zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!\" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A \"nevíme jak\" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…",
