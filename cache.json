Not only that, but it's also received a complete name change and is now called 'beat refle', which sounds like a bit of a play on the term 'Reflexology'. It's certainly a more \"neutral\" title, that's for sure.\nThe release follows a storm of controversy following the initial reveal of Massage Freaks. Its depiction of women and the scenarios in which they find themselves caused many to draw comparisons to real-life sex crimes in Japan. In addition, the forenames of the in-game characters were identical to some of the members of Japanese idol group 'Hinatazaka46' before qureate swifly made moves to alter them. Indeed, the Steam page for beat refle contains a few choice statements to potentially avoid any future controversy:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Everyone was excited for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo was getting the GameCube ready to succeed the Nintendo 64. Microsoft's Xbox was also in development but much of the focus was on Sega and its continuing demise following poor sales of the Dreamcast after its famous launch on 9/9/99. It seemed the game was up when, in January 2001, Sega announced it would be abandoning the console market to concentrate on third-party software development.\nMany predicted that Sega would collapse under the financial pressures and be consigned to gaming history. However, something remarkable happened and the once giant of console gaming quickly reinvented itself to become a successful third-party software developer.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Some of us buy nothing but digital games, preferring to be able to play whatever we want, wherever we want; others meticulously collect every single physical release they can get their mitts on, before prices skyrocket for a second-hand copy on eBay.\nBut one thing most of us have in common, especially those of us who gamed before digital-only games were a thing, is a collection of things that represent our gaming career. Sometimes, that's the pristine shrink-wrapped copy of Ocarina of Time that we bought in 199whatever from a garage sale that didn't know what they had; sometimes, our gaming pride and joy is one of those clear bouncy balls with a plastic Pikachu inside it, because it has sentimental meaning to us.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

          "description": "During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. \nYou play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love? \nRead more",

I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.\nIt's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.\nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.\nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.\nThe idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap.

          "description": "It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Kill the Wabbit\nThis past weekend saw fight fans lock horns in Warner Bros' brand new scrapper MultiVersus, the crossover fighter having just launched its open access beta on PC and console platforms — And while the fur has only been flying for a few days, already characters are queued up to have their wings clipped by developer Player First Games.\nIn something of an obscure tweet posted this weekend, MultiVersus director Tony Huynh noted that \"Nerfs Inc.\" would be headed to the title post-EVO (which takes place in Las Vegas this weekend). While no specific characters were announced for the chopping block, Huynh added that \"Bugs Bunny will always be fun.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1552517058918682624?s=20&t=unq02SbgfNGQK4ddQ-VM9A\nNo doubt Huynh is pointing toward the fact that the carrot-chomping smart arse is already proving to be something of a dominant player within MultiVersus' crossover world. Bugs has seemingly overshot Taz as somebody singled out as something of a problem character for players, after the latter had his devastating Tornado Spin attack scaled right down scant hours into the beta's launch.\nIn a chaotic platform fighter such as MultiVersus, it can be difficult to accurately ascertain who may have a leg-up on the competition. Add to that the way ALL fighting game players call for nerfs within minutes of a title's launch, and it takes a sharp developer to truly ascertain which characters are actually broken and which characters players are simply \"losing to\" as they aren't bothering to learn the matchup.\nEither way, MultiVersus has had an immensely healthy beta launch, with over 144,000 players logging into Steam at its peak period. We shall see how the title retains its audience over the coming weeks and months. MultiVersus is now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post The nerf mallet may be coming for Bugs Bunny in MultiVersus appeared first on Destructoid.",

Instead of being packed out with screaming, tattoed gals sporting cool names like \"Anna Geddon\", this digital take on hard-hitting wheeled warfare features a bunch of boring 8-bit dudes. We were still a good six years away from the debut of the outrageous, WWE-like show Rollergames, and thus Roller Jammer boasts a less glamorous, simplistic take on the sport.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqW8NZ3bQ_8\nPerhaps understanding that it does not have tech available to recreate the ins and outs of roller derby proper, Nichibutsu chooses to play a little fast and loose with its adaptation of the sport, tasking playing with gunning through thin slaloms of flags before eventually engaging in an every-man-for-themselves race, complete with a hilarious \"double lariat\" maneuver. While Roller Jammer's relative obscurity makes this Arcade Archives release a little notable, ultimately it's pretty difficult to recommend this title.\nRoller Jammer is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Whip it Good: Roller Jammer skates into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I guess there are no more tombs to raid... for now\nHollywood has already taken two different shots at the Tomb Raider franchise, starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander respectively, but it looks like there's a chance another actress will get a chance to helm the series, as TheWrap reports. The film rights to Tomb Raider are up for grabs yet again after MGM failed to make a sequel after the 2018 film, which would have allowed them to keep the rights — although there were plans to make another film in the series at one point.\nThe most likely factor in plans for the sequel fizzling out is Amazon's acquisition of MGM back in March of this year. There's a good chance that with the merger going on, any projects in the works were put on pause, which is unfortunate when there's a ticking clock for maintaining your IPs. Fans had a lukewarm reaction regarding the 2018 movie, but it did fairly well at the box office internationally, so it's kind of a shame that they're not getting a second chance with Vikander's version of Croft.\n\nTomb Raider's treasure-hunting counterpart Uncharted (also sometimes called Dude Raider by fans) did quite well in the box office this year, raking in just over $400 million, and securing its spot as the fourth most profitable video game movie to date. It's hard to say whether this had to do with its star-studded cast, which included Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, or if fans just liked the movie more, but either way, I think it shows that fans are still down for an Indiana Jones-inspired action adventure.\nThere's a good chance that we'll be getting another reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise from whoever picks up the rights, so here's hoping that the third time's a charm for the franchise. Until then, there's always the Tomb Raider anime that Netflix still has in the works.\nThe post Tomb Raider film rights are up in the air after MGM lost out appeared first on Destructoid.",

These are not even Fairytail Parfum's first dalliance with the world of Guilty Gear, as the company has previously released perfumes based on Dizzy and Elphelt Valentine — two beloved characters who are yet to make their roster appearance in Guilty Gear Strive (which may be why they have been replaced by Ram and Jack-O in this range).\nThese are the new fragrance builds, as reported by the fine folk of Siliconera.\nRamlethal: Red thyme, jasmine, and peony at the top; powder, white freesia, and lily of the valley in the middle; white musk, suede, and spice at the bottom.\nJack-O: Fragrant olive, yuzu, and jasmine at the top; iris, apricot, and magnolia in the middle; musk and cedarwood at the bottom.\nYou can check out the full range of fragrances over on the official Fairytail Parfum website. Given the company's Japanese origins, GG fans will likely have to go the import route if they wish to pick up the new perfumes.

And, as it turns out, it's not some grand marketing scheme for a new Nier or a long-hidden secret. It is a mod. But the end result is pretty impressive nonetheless.\nTo backtrack for those who missed it the first time around, a player by the name of \"sadfutago\" was conspicuously seeking help in advancing through a church they found in Nier: Automata. The thing is, this particular part of the Copied City had never been seen before, and no one was able to replicate it.\nAs a potential new discovery in a well-loved series like Nier, it obviously caused a stir.

Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!\nAs a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they've been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists \"December 31, 2022\" as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a \"global release date\" system, it's typically close enough barring regional delays.\nProduction on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it'll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what's left, we don't know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.\nAs always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that's been updated since 2015.\nThe post Both the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo will be out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Switch is coming later this year\nI'm always looking for the next title to scratch my cozy game addiction, and it looks like the management sim Bear and Breakfast is the newest release to make that list. While I first heard about the game during the Summer Game Fest stream this year with the gameplay trailer, it was initially announced back in 2020. Players take on the role of a bear named Hank who builds and runs his own bed and breakfast in the woods, and will encounter all kinds of human and animal friends along the way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USaiP4ACTB4\nThe developers at Gumycat said that they \"grew up on management sims,\" and that games like Theme Hospital were a huge inspiration for them. In addition to the \"usual management stuff,\" they also wanted to create a game that tells a story.\nThe premise is that humans are coming back for some unknown reason, and they need a place to stay, so Hank and his friends decide to fix up old buildings around town for them. Players will advance through Bear and Breakfast's story by completing quests that entail the aforementioned management stuff like gathering materials, crafting, building, decorating, and so on. There's even a kind of puzzle element to booking guests, making sure they have food they like, as well as some kind of creepy subplot going on, too.\nThe game's art style reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons in an adorably nostalgic way, and the game's comedic writing is already being praised in the Steam reviews. With an ever-growing list of games to play these days, Bear and Breakfast has managed (see what I did there?) to find a place at the very top of it. In the past, I've found some management games to lack the depth to have staying power, but this title promises a rich, worthwhile experience that I can't wait to play.\nBear and Breakfast is out now on Steam and a Nintendo Switch version is slated for release in \"2022.\"\nThe post Cozy simulator Bear and Breakfast is out today on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The trailer dives into the game's fourth region,&nbsp;Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.</p>\n\n<p>The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the&nbsp;Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.</p>\n\n<p>All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</p>",

As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. </p>\n\n<p>After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark…",

You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/03/the-foundation-played-by-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-now-unlockable-in-fortnite\" target=\"_blank\">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this&nbsp;trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate&nbsp;“forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw&nbsp;more sports entertainment into the mix&nbsp;by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Do you plan on chasing victory royales as Big Match John? Let us know in the comments!&nbsp;</p>",

Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.</p>",

I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police.

Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/summer-game-fest/2022/06/09/new-gotham-knights-trailer-shows-off-a-variant-nightwing-suit-and\">Nightwing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/28/robins-gotham-knights-toolkit-includes-teleportation-and-slingshots\">Robin</a>, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.</p>\n\n<p>Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.</p>\n\n<p>The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.</p>\n\n<p>Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.</p>",

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.</p>\n\n<p>Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.</p>\n\n<p>Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.</p>\n\n<p>Are you excited to revisit this classic?

The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and&nbsp;players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison.
