          "description": "Taking the JRPG formula back to basics.\nThe Dragon Quest series is a staple in the JRPG community, continually churning out games of varying quality for more than 35 years. The latest entry in this seminal franchise is Dragon Quest Treasures, a spin-off from the mainline series, with many of the standard Dragon Quest tropes packaged into one of the most accessible JRPG experiences out there. While that translates into this game being a good starting point for fans new to the genre and the series, it won’t pose much of a challenge for seasoned treasure hunters.\nDragon Quest Treasures features a pair of familiar faces from the outset. Erik, who served as a party member in Dragon Quest XI, and his younger sister Mia toil away onboard a Viking ship searching for treasurers to plunder. Here is the first hint that this game is aimed at a younger audience, as the Vikings are presented as far more friendly and jolly than they were in Dragon Quest XI. Erik and Mia are aged down as well, with younger features and a more enthusiastic attitude befitting this cheerier adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This puts it just behind Splatoon 3's current total of 3,446,339, though it's probably safe to say that this has now been surpassed as of the time of writing.\nThere are only two new entries this week, including Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Yu-Gi-Oh!

          "description": "Big Fish.\nDespite its title being ostensibly plucked from the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name, publisher Sammy’s The Rumble Fish series bears zero resemblance bar the odd bout of fisticuffs. Or, in this case, bout upon bout of fisticuffs, with a cast of colourful and interestingly designed characters.\nThe Rumble Fish series’ distinct hallmark is in its graphical style, once poised to catch the arcade goer’s eye and stir up interest in Sammy’s Atomiswave hardware. Rather than using standard hand-drawn sprites, it instead uses a routine where limbs are independently animated using sleek Flash-like animation. Although this gives the characters a certain marionette look, it’s a far cry from the likes of Earnest Evans, a Mega Drive and Mega-CD title that applied the same idea to unintended comical effect. Here, the Rumble Fish cast look great, blessed with a dreamy colour palette that really pops off the screen.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "This is more like it!\nNintendo is back with another wave of eight courses for the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, bringing us to the halfway point of its overall road map. Now we're up to a total of 24 new tracks over six unique cups, but so far, the output has been a bit mixed: we’ve had some bonafide classics like Coconut Mall and Mushroom Gorge, but also some absolute stinkers like New York Minute and Tokyo Blur. So how does the latest wave compare? Well thankfully, there’s a lot here to like and fewer bad eggs in the mix, making this comfortably the strongest batch of new courses yet.\nStarting off with Rock Cup, we’ve got London Loop, Boo Lake, Alpine Pass, and Maple Treeway. Things get off to a bit of a rough start, as London Loop is easily the weakest track of the whole bunch; this might come as little surprise given that it’s based on Mario Kart Tour and lacks the verticality and creativity seen in other games, but there’s no doubting that London Loop is an exceptionally dull start to Rock Cup. Conversely, the latter three courses are all remarkably fun in their own way, from Boo Lake’s deceptive simplicity to Maple Treeway’s meandering track and stomping Wigglers. It’s great fun and incredibly nostalgic if you’ve played the original games on which the tracks come from.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's the sideburns and long-johns of The Adventure of Link, the long body and pointed features of Ocarina of Time, the eyeliner and fringe of Twilight Princess ('it's not just a phase Muuuum') and then shaggy wild explorer of Breath of the Wild.\nAnd yet, no style is as easily recognisable as the Link that we see in Wind Waker, The Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. The weirdly off head-to-body ratio, the bright colours, the bulbous eyes, this style has created a character all of its own (at least, Smash Bros. and amiibo would say so). We know this little guy simply as 'Toon Link' and we imagine that most of you would think the same. After all, you want to play in this style on Smash Bros. Ultimate? You choose Toon Link. You buy the amiibo? It quite literally says Toon Link on the box. But what if that's not his official name?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. \nHowever, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new \"Stealth Strategy\" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.\nRead more",

Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for \"Sweet Potato\" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. \nIn a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.\nRead more",

Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.\nAnyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I've been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game's story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I'm ecstatic.

The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.\nAnyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I'm out of town right now, so I haven't been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know?

If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren't enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games' The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. \nIn some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be \"in constant fluctuation\" throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. \"It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat,\" says Becker. \"Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what 'victory' meant in the war - even with success, there is cost.\"\nRead more",

Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. \r\n\nThe good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.\nRead more",

Bulwark Studios' star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic's RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.\nAlso like Homeworld, it's a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead's pride & joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.\nRead more",

Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades.

On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don't seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.\n Read more",

The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. \nThere's a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan's authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it. \n\n \nRead more",

It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\nKynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.\nRead more",

          "description": "Unlike buses, Valve games do not come in threes. That isn't about to change anytime soon, but one of the main writers behind both Portal games has revealed that they've got a \"pretty awesome\" idea for Portal 3. Erik Wolpaw say he and fellow Portal 2 penner Jay Pinkerton have even floated that idea around Valve, to a positive response. It's totes on the cards, is what it sounds like.  \nThe news comes from Wolpaw's recent interview with YouTuber DidYouKnowGaming, which is also worth a watch to learn about all the ideas Valve didn't wind up using in Portal 2. At one point it had bullet time. \n\n \nRead more",

Taking to Darktide’s Discord to ask why you can’t just buy a specific amount of Aquilas for the items you want, one player was told by a spokesperson for Fatshark that adding such a feature would be “immeasurably complex”. \r\n\n \nRead more",

They're simple novelties, but there's also an edit button on each one that allows you to tinker with them so you can plop down your own walls, enemies, switches and keys. The Doodle has been built to celebrate Jerry Lawson, a Black video game pioneer and the engineer who led the team that designed the first home video game console to use cartridges.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'm about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn't quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. \nImagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3's dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I've ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they'd earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it's been a while.\nRead more",

But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they \"still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly\" via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they'll go \"where the players are\".\nRead more",

Asassin's Creed Valhalla's free, final content update has arrived a week early, sending Eivor off to North America for one last hurrah.\nThere are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what's going on, which is a shame because I'd love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.\nRead more",

Still, no matter what I think about World Of Warcraft today, it still holds a special place in my heart as an important formative experience.\nEven the time capsule that's Classic WoW probably couldn't capture the same buzz of the past, mainly because I, as a being of flesh and bone, am not a teenager anymore. But I'd argue there's one place that still captures the essence of WoW more than WoW itself nowadays: YouTube.

The free 3.6 Orion update for Paradox’s spacey grand strategy Stellaris is live now, and it's done that, but in a way I hadn’t quite imagined. Among the changes with this update are six new galaxy shapes to mix up the pattern of your interstellar empires a bit. Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October. Paradox have chucked in a few reworks of bits and pieces from Stellaris’ numerous expansions too, including changes to the Utopia DLC’s Ascension path.

          "description": "For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.\r\n\nQuestion is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lea upon layer\nKojima Productions has dropped another character teaser for its unannounced new project, ahead of whispers that tonight's Game Awards will offer up a full reveal of the next title coming out of the esoteric developer.\nMuch like its previous teasers, the new image depicts the shadowed face of one of the game's cast, emblazoned with a simple question \"How Come?\". The mysterious image follows on from the previous reveals of actors Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon, Maleficent) and Shiloli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). While the identity of the new face is yet to be confirmed, fans are strongly convinced that it is that of Lea Seydoux, (No Time to Die, The French Dispatch) who has previously portrayed \"Fragile\" in Kojima Productions' Death Stranding.\nhttps://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1600596136632279040?s=20&t=DRErVG6METsZbv8ZMDBkqw\nDoes this latest teaser confirm that the new Kojima title is a Death Stranding sequel? Ehh... Hardly. I know we live in an era where people seem to recognize Characters and not Actors, but it's just as likely that, if it is indeed Seydoux, Hideo Kojima simply wished to work alongside her again. Either way, it probably won't be too much longer before we hear a little more about the project, as Kojima himself has been seen in Los Angeles, all but confirming the scampster's appearance at The Game Awards.\nYou can watch along with us tonight right here on Destructoid. The Game Awards 2022 kicks off at 17:00 PST / 20:00 ET / 01:00 BST, and promises an evening of live performances, awards ceremonies, and lots, and lots, and lots of advertising.\nThe post Kojima productions drops another teaser ahead of The Game Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first is that the game is an enjoyable treasuring-hunting romp with hours of content, a unique combat experience, and the type of what-will-I-find-next obsession that drives people to empty their bank accounts into loot boxes and gacha. The second is that it’s a $60 busy-work simulator, where all you do is complete mundane tasks to progress through a mundane adventure.\nBoth perspectives fit the bill here, and whether or not you see this game as a cavort or a chore is really going to come down to your tolerance level for a game built on backtracki…",

          "description": "Load up on Cuffs\nAs is often the case in the lead-up to The Game Awards, several rumors and leaks are floating around the information superhighway ahead of Keighley's grand festivities — Case in point: a tweet published by the Japanese PlayStation Twitter, pointing to an incoming demo for Square Enix adventure Forspoken.\nThe (now deleted) tweet sported some attractive new splash art, emblazoned with the words \"Demo Announcement Trailer\". The sudden removal of the tweet suggests that said video is cued to play during tonight's live TGA presentation. The deleted tweet also referenced an 11-minute Forspoken gameplay showcase, which will likely be hosted on the official PlayStation YouTube channel tomorrow, December 9, as part of Forspoken's continuing \"Deep Dive\" video series.\nhttps://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1600756189943410689?s=20&t=8d2Qc74adzfu6ObMzVeGKQ\nWhile Forspoken has had something of an inauspicious start, with online jokesters mocking its marketing strategy and critics raising an eyebrow at some admittedly foolish PR speak, I personally think that Forspoken is an attractive title with potential. A 2023 GOTY contender? maybe not, but it could certainly prove a fun way to kick off 2023's gaming year. No doubt Square Enix hopes that allowing players to get their hands on a playable build, giving them the opportunity to explore Athia and meet hero Frey Holland — will help turn around some of this early cynicism ahead of the title's impending release.\nForspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC.\nThe post Forspoken demo reportedly coming to PlayStation very soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Handhelds were for smaller, less prestigious titles, while home consoles were for the big, knock-your-socks-off blockbusters. Enter Nintendo, with the friendly reminder that it didn't have to be that way. It's not that difficult to get a handheld to run a home console-quality game, and it's not that difficult to add an HDMI output to a handheld for those who still value the TV screen experience.\nNintendo was the first major company to properly execute on this idea (Sony's PlayStation TV doesn't count), and the Switch saw massive success as a result.

Even longtime fans of the franchise such as myself were shocked.\nMy Japanese is lousy, but I can read the language well enough to recognize the characters \"Ru-Ku\" in the image above. That translates to English as \"Luke\", which alone would have been enough to make Lucasfilm's lawyers foam at the mouth. Reading through the blurb is a little tougher for me, but per a confirmed A.I, translation from NMH super fan Travis Dies Every Day, the full text reads:\n\"Modern Jedi Master 'Luke'. Danshiya 'Luke'. His real name is Travis Touchdown. A geek and a thug of the hitman business, I will take on any boring killing. There is no creed at all. I go to the mall four times a week. In other words, if you don't have work, you don't have time, and you don't have friends.\"\n\"He runs danshi [boy?] with homemade sabers. All [of] his weapons, Naomi is making. He is currently ranked 11th in the UAA rankings. Fanatical fan of Japanese anime, especially the witch system is a favorite. Now I love it. I love T-shirts.\"\n\nAnyone who's played the series knows that this isn't too far from how the actual in-game dialogue might sound. Other than the gun in his left hand, and the overt announcement that Travis is, in-fact, a Jedi named after Luke Skywalker, all of this could, plausibly, have been official!\nAnd wait a minute, wasn't SUDA51's company rumored to be working on an Aliens game? That franchise is just one degree of legal separation from Star Wars! Maybe gun-toting Travis with this Skywalking nickname still has a chance of making it.\nThe post Travis Touchdown’s original nickname was, it seems, pure Star Wars appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alongside some shifts to cosmetics and the return of a map, Halo Infinite now also has a custom game browser.\nThe latest update allows players to flip through available custom games, looking for one they might want to hop into and play. The Halo Infinite browser has filters for different options, including the base map and mode being used.\nAnd as the trailer advertises, there are already some solid custom game creations out there. They range from recreations to some pretty neat ideas like Paintball, and the browser should hopefully make them easier to find.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTjL_AMaWns\nFalling back into The Pit\nSome other additions arrive in the December Update, too. All armor cores and cadet coatings are now free. And Halo 3's The Pit returns as Empyrean, which is less fun as a name in my opinion, but still looks like the same ol' Pit I've played plenty of matches on.\nThe custom game browser is really the major addition here though, as it really builds out the Forge component of Halo Infinite. Forge hit beta in November, and now discoverability for those modes is that much easier.\n\nI frequently get very nostalgic about the days of custom game browsing. Whether it was Halo or something like Warcraft, the server browser was a place where I discovered a lot of cool, fun, inventive ways to reimagine a game I enjoy.\nHopefully, this custom game browser gives Halo Infinite a good boost headed into the new year.

By the time Diablo 2 rolled around my little crew of Diablo-playing-friends was around 20 strong, and it was a bonafide hit that people still play today.\nBut Diablo 3 changed things considerably. Blizzard was already changing in terms of its perception as a bulletproof company, and the Auction House debacle was a sign of trouble to come for the publisher.

          "description": "Switch Soldiers\nHead of Xbox Phil Spencer has said that Microsoft is looking to bring the Call of Duty franchise back to Nintendo platforms, should the industry giant's pending purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard find approval.\nSpeaking in a very brief statement on Twitter, Spencer said that Microsoft had already provisionally entered into a \"10-year commitment\" to see that the billion-dollar military franchise makes its grand return on Switch and future platforms. The last Call of Duty to see release on a Nintendo platform was Call of Duty: Ghost, which launched on Nintendo WiiU way back in 2013.\nhttps://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1600342335845724160?s=20&t=lmFEpvwbJ0_eB6GIR5b7tA\nAs we have previously reported, Call of Duty remains both the Golden Goose and the ultimate lynchpin in Microsoft's efforts to close out its $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard — an industry-shaking maneuver that was announced one year ago, but is yet to find global approval from a variety of trading standards bodies. Both The European Trade Commission and U.S. FTC regulators are still to confirm the findings of their respective antitrust regulations, though some territories — such as Brazil and Saudi Arabia — have already offered their unconditional approval.\nMeanwhile, Sony continues in its efforts to put a halt to the deal, which appears almost entirely based on the concern of losing the Call of Duty franchise on PlayStation platforms. Global news outlet Reuters has suggested that Microsoft might be forced to make a commitment concession to Sony in order to secure global approval and move forward with the purchase.\nThe regulatory bodies must come to a final decision on the sale in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe post Call of Duty to return to Nintendo platforms if Microsoft/Activision merger approved appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's got an elegant, watercolor-esque art style, and what the gameplay lacks in hardcore, traditional mechanics it makes up for in emotionally resonant, albeit vague, storytelling vignettes -- just how I like it. To boot, the game actually has some nice platforming sections, which absolutely gave me trouble as someone who is horrible at platformers. Gris certainly isn't a game everyone will enjoy, but I do think it's a game everyone should at least try. If you haven't played it yet, now you won't have any excuse, because Gris is finally getting ported to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on December 13.\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1600173231360466945\nThe game follows the titular character Gris, a \"hopeful young girl lost in her own world, dealing with a painful experience in her life. Her journey through sorrow is manifested in her dress, which grants new abilities to better navigate her faded reality.\" The Steam description also bills Gris as a game \"free of danger, frustration or death,\" which is true in terms of it not having a fail state, but I have to admit that the aforementioned platforming sections did frustrate me a bit. That's more of a me problem, though.\nGris ended up winning a ton of well-deserved awards back in 2019 after its release, including Best Visual Art at the Game Developers Choice Awards and Games for Impact at the Game Awards. It's a short game, too, so you could finish it in an afternoon if you wanted to. Personally, I played on the Switch, and it made for a great lazing-on-the-couch-during-a-rainy-day game. I'll have no problems at all running on the most recent gen consoles, and I'll be interested to see if they use the DualSense to add some extra haptics to enhance the experience.\nThe post Gris is coming to PlayStation and Xbox this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, if you're a Nintendo Switch owner and need a little bit of schoolgal sluggin' to tide you over, then you're in luck, as WayForward's cartoonish brawler is now available to play for \"free\" as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Game Trial service.\nFrom today until December 12, all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can download and play the 2019 scrapper in its entirety, guiding Kyoko and Misako through the avenues and alleyways of River City on a mission to discover the truth behind the disappearance of boyfriends Kunio and Riki. Should you decide to bag the full game for yourself, then RCG is currently available on the eShop for a discounted price for the duration of the trial.\nAs for River City Girls 2, well, Japan already has the long-awaited sequel, though seemingly not in its complete and fully featured form. WayForward announced earlier today that the western release will be blessing us on December 15. That's next week! So while the fist-throwing sequel might be hitting these shores a little later than expected, at least we can expect to receive the title as nature intended — complete with its roster of cool characters and its wild 'n' chaotic four-player mode.\nRiver City Girls 2 launches December 15 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Players will still be able to play and exchange in-game currencies for items up until Monster Slayer's closure. Then, on June 30, 2023, the servers will be shut down.\nThe team also made a statement, thanking fans for sharing in the Monster Slayer journey.\n\"We are proud that we were able to create a location-based AR experience that captured what it was like to be a witcher in real life and gave the community a chance to battle Witcher-world monsters up close and in person,\" the statement reads. \"This is what made The Witcher: Monster Slayer such a unique experience in The Witcher franchise.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhtWqIFydfo\nSomething ends, something begins\nAccording to Spokko's statement, Monster Slayer did not reach its business expectations. Spokko will be rolled into CD Projekt Red, with part of its staff given the chance to join core CD Projket Red projects. However, there will be some staff let go.\nWhile Monster Slayer was a bit strange, as a Pokemon GO approach to the world of The Witcher, it's still a shame to see the project's closure result in departures.

Newcomers Marian (of Double Dragon fame) and Provie (from River City Ransom: Underground) also join the cast, rounding it out to six playable characters. And they'll need all that extra help to take on the Sanwakai syndicate that's turning River City upside down.\nRiver City Girls 2 has already launched in Japan and Asia, but the western version saw a bit of a delay.

You have the people who got into video games because they played Ocarina of Time as a kid. You also have the people who say Zelda has never been good since it went 3D. Even the games someone didn’t play can be revealing. For example, I considered whether or not I was qualified to write this list because I never touched The Minish Cap or A Link Between Worlds. Hey, don’t look at me, I skipped the 3DS game because someone gave it a 6.5.\nIn other words, an objective ranking of Zelda games is impossible. Yet by the same token, every time someone ranks th…",

          "description": "Fly me to the Moonspell\nIndie hit Vampire Survivors is getting its first big piece of DLC. Legacy of the Moonspell is a new Vampire Survivors DLC arriving next week on December 15.\nThe new content will be coming to both PC via Steam and Xbox on the 15th, and will run $1.99 USD. The Steam page is live now, with a host of info on what's to come in the Legacy of the Moonspell next week.\n\nWhat's in store for the Survivors? Well, the Legacy takes the action to a new map in the eastern lands, known as Mt. Moonspell. This locale is developer poncle's biggest stage yet, featuring several different environments include snowy mountains, a yokai-infested village, and yes, an abandoned castle.\nEight new characters join the fray, with four getting shown off today. 13 new weapons are also i nstore, including a set of season-shifting orbs and an ancestral force unleashed by a staff. Seems like a good way to blast a bunch of enemies away for experience.\nAdditionally, there are some hidden mysteries and more in store. Between the characters and weapons that poncle isn't revealing yet, it seems like there is a fair bit to discover in this new drop.\nI will survive\nIt seems like just yesterday that Vampire Survivors was a surprise hit trending up Steam's charts. Now, poncle's horde survival game is dominating Steam charts and commandeering Steam Decks. Heck, it has a Game Awards nomination.\nWhile its star is on the rise, it's nice to see the Vampire Survivors crew keeping it going. Even the DLC itself is quite reasonably priced. It'll be nice to have some more crowds to blast through for crystals during the holidays.\nVampire Survivors' Legacy of the Moonspell DLC arrives for PC and Xbox on December 15, 2022.\nThe post Vampire Survivors gets its first DLC, Legacy of the Moonspell, next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "'Gwenfinity' to see players take control of meta\nCD Projekt RED has announced that it plans to start sunsetting Gwent — the spin-off card game from mega-popular RPG franchise The Witcher — in 2023. As of 2024, no further cards will be produced for the digital tabletop title, with a total of three expansions planned before the deck closes for good.\n\"We are not planning to release new cards starting from 2024, so the cards which will release in 2023 basically will be the last brand-new ones that we will be adding to the game,\" revealed Gwent director Vladimir Tortsov in a developer video. \"It's a pretty significant change, there's no way around it.\n\n\"With the cards that we are planning to add to the game next year, we are basically planning to close the card pool with every idea that we wanted to add, every mechanic that we wanted to see, pretty much everything that we would like to see in Gwent, we will try to fit it within the year.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EsTFtuDT2k\nThis does not, however, mean that Gwent will become a dead, non-playable entity. In a motion known to the studio as \"Gwenfinity\", a skeleton crew will be assigned to routinely keep one eye on the game's infrastructure, while the players themselves will be offered the opportunity to decide upon rule changes and balance tweaks as the Gwent meta continues, post-support.\nWith this new system, CDPR hopes that the Gwent community will be able to continue enjoying, and even evolving, the fantasy tabletop title. And so, while support will officially end in 2024, there will hopefully still be many, many years of coin-tossing over tavern tables still to come.\nThe post Witcher card game Gwent to wind down support in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Funky Monky\nToday sees the launch of the second season of Activision Blizzard's arena shooter, Overwatch 2 — And in something of a minor reshuffle, the development team has announced that it will be moving its newest hero, Ramattra, to Tier 45 on the season 2 battle pass, from his initial sitting of Tier 55.\n\"Hey all! Quick update on some changes coming to Season 2,\" wrote OW2 director Aaron Miller on Twitter. \"After reviewing data for Season 1, we're moving Ramattra [to] Tier 45 of the Battle Pass and making a few more weekly challenges easier to complete. Excited for you all to see everything new in Season 2 starting tomorrow!\"\nhttps://twitter.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1599834286546644992?s=20&t=FunV3K50ZmLJkCJKMAE0Ww\nOriginally, Overwatch heroes were simply added to all players' rosters as they were released. But with the arrival of Overwatch 2 and its free-to-play structure, the new heroes now reside within the debuting, (and hugely divisive), battle pass system. By moving the new heroes to Tier 45, it is hoped that players will unlock the characters faster, though it is, admittedly, still a pretty meaty grind to get there.\nThe addition of the battle pass mechanic has been met with much grumbling from the Overwatch faithful. A common complaint, (echoed by this writer), is that it is simply a dull and excitement-free way to unlock goodies, and pales in comparison to the box of goodies players would receive for popping a new level. Of course, loot boxes come with their own highly negative ramifications, but, personally, I'll take the loot box animation and fistful of varied treats over grinding through endless drab avatar images... while paying for the privilege.\nOverwatch 2 season 2 kicks off today on all platforms. You can check out our hands-on look at its newest hero, Ramattra, in our previous report.\nThe post Overwatch 2 shifts new heroes to Tier 45 on Battle Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.\nAfter raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this video game documentary, please consider sharing the link on your favorite social media site or share it with a friend.

          "description": "Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. \nIGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that \"This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.\" First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” \nGiven the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. \"I do think at some point we'll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.\" \nSony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.\nAs a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation. \n[Source: IGN]\nWhat do you think of Microsoft adopting the $70 price? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.\nMeet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. \n\n\nPalworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you're catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we're still not entirely convinced it's a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. \nThankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we'll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.",

          "description": "Since its reveal in 2016, Lost Soul Aside has been one of the most promising and mysterious projects on the horizon. Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. \nLost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. \n\n\nDespite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. \nLost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

There's a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 \"A New Beginning\" trailer, which you can watch below: \n\n\nHere's another look at the Chapter 4 map: \nElsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. \nBefore all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 \"Fracture\" finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. \nPlayers were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. \n\nFortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed. \nDid you participate in the Chapter 3 finale? What did you think of it?

We've seen Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in previous footage, but today's trailer gives us our longest look yet at the duo. Both continue to embody the spirit of Joel and Ellie in the games well and you can watch new footage of their scenes in the newest trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the trailer features a lot more of Joel and Ellie, but it also gives us new looks at clickers, a bloater, and possibly even David (although it could be someone else, like one of David's henchmen). We also see Bill and Frank, and this trailer seems to tease that we'll be getting a lot more of their relationship in the show than we did in the game. In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it couple of moments, we even see Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the games (shout-out to SlashFilm for catching that):\n#TheLastOfUs voice actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson appear in the new trailer for the HBO series. pic.twitter.com/z2oY51PFei\nDecember 3, 2022\nThe Last of Us premieres on HBO Max on January 15. \nFor more, check out this teaser trailer from September.\nWhat do you think of today's trailer?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Its recent expansion, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, will follow suit sometime next Spring. \nThe latest entry in the uber-popular series comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 20. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console, PC, and cloud at launch. The current-gen versions specifically boast 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay, and 3D audio, among other customizable options. However, a disclaimer on a new trailer states that 3D Audio will come to the Xbox One version in a Spring update. The PS5 port also supports DualSense haptic feedback for ranged and shielded weapons. The game is priced at $39.99 across all platforms. \n\n\nMonster Hunter Rise first launched in March 2021 for Switch before migrating to PC in January of this year. Sunbreak made its way to both platforms this past June. In addition to this news, Capcom reveals that Rise has sold over 11 million units since its launch. \nTo learn more, check out our reviews for Monster Hunter Rise here and the Sunbreak expansion here.",

The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.\nGoodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. \n\n\nKO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. \nGoodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.",

Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was on hand to introduce the new trailer; Anya Taylor-Joy (who is playing Princess Peach) and Seth Rogan (who voices Donkey Kong) also shared selfie videos of themselves sharing their contractually obligated excitement about participating in the film.\nThe trailer showed more of the Mushroom Kingdom and primarily focused on Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. We also heard more from Chris Pratt's Mario, Charlie Day's Luigi, and Jack Black's Bowser (who explicitly refers to Mario as being a human). The trailer shows Mario training, fighting Donkey Kong, driving a kart on a rainbow road, traveling with Peach, and there was also one quick moment where we saw the human world.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7, 2023. You can see our live reaction to the trailer below.",

It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to \"please be patient\" because \"it's gonna be a while until we can share more details\" when the company announced this game last month. \nThe Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename \"Hadar.\" \n[Source: VG247]\nAre you excited that The Witcher Remake will be open-world or do you wish it was more like the original?

Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review.

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. \nEven more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…",

According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
