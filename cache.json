One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an \"Indigenous cybernoir detective game\" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe \"in the works\" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.\nThe trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s ‚Äî complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with \"crime, conflict, and propaganda\".

Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you'll be on the right lines.\nThe trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma's whole retro futuristic vibe. It's got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the '90s, which of course means that it's much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: ¬£46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.\nRead more",

          "description": "One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? \"No,\" I said. \"No way. Not a chance. I wouldn't like it.\" People were shocked at my refusal. \"But nothing will go wrong!\" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.\nHonestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.\nRead more",

Slotting in snugly right after Geoff regaled us with the Summer Game Fest stream, this year‚Äôs Day Of The Devs showcase marked the tenth anniversary. Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso‚Äôs beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there‚Äôs nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it ‚Äì and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.\nIt‚Äôs a strategic evolution I‚Äôll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn‚Äôt the only part of Midnight Suns story that‚Äôs been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos' fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight‚Äôs Summer Game Fest).

The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it's actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). \nDiablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it's all right to play! However, I don't know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it's a bad decision and we've already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.\nRead more",

Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It's an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.\n\"About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it,\" says producer Swann Martin-Raget. \"We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we've adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us.\"\nRead more",

It's an interactive story you control with split-second decisions and quick time events; it is mostly plot.

After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare ‚Äì an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry‚Äôs multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.\nIt turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner‚Äôs reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2‚Äôs impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.\nRead more",

Most of the games at the show might look niche to those whose definition of \"an average and normal videogame\" is a AAA shooter, but for the majority of people in the world (most of whom have never played The Last of Us or Halo in their lives), stuff like skateboarding birds wearing funny hats is a lot more inviting.\nThat's probably why, despite middling initial reviews and a lack of big publisher support, SkateBIRD is \"on the cusp of making a million bucks\" in profit. It's fun too! A few patches after launch, the game plays better than ever, and if you still find any of the controls to be frustrating, most of them can be adjusted in accessibility settings. Those options, plus the universal appeal of becoming a double-jumping swallow who can freestyle (and fumble) across a series of duct-taped skate parks, have done a lot to help the game make numbers.\nSome of those dollars have been spent on making the game even better. Announced at the Wholesome Direct, the game will be getting an update today that adds a new pool-themed park, a playable crewmate from Among Us, and new Pride-themed outfits, though SkateBIRD creator Megan Fox tells us she \"...just wanted gay clothes anyways and I'd added them a while ago, and then it accidentally lined up...\" with both the month-long LGBTQ+ celebration and its coinciding Wholesome Direct.\nThis content is headed to¬†SkateBIRD on consoles as well, so if you want to whip out your Switch and kickflip with an owl while wearing rainbow beenie, you won't have to wait long.\nThe post SkateBIRD gets a new park, new birds, Among Us content, and gay clothes appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if you too want to flip mysterious space bee, you can, as retro publisher Hamster has now added the forgotten title to its mammoth Arcade Archives on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased in arcades in 1985, before later finding its way to the home computer market, Motos is a very early entry in the car battler genre and sees vehicular carnage located against the backdrop of a bizarre platform floating adrift in outer space. The player pilots the titular \"Moto\" and is tasked with running each of their opponents off of the stage, while avoiding taking a tumble into the void themselves.\nA whopping 62 stages of bumper-to-bumper action awaits, featuring increasingly nasty hordes of enemies, as well as vehicle upgrades such as the momentum-boosting \"Power Bumps\" and even \"Jump Parts\", which afford our Moto the ability to leap through the air, Knight Rider-style. You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber spaceharrier80. Be sure to check out the game's cute beep-boop score, powered by Namco's formative Super Pac-Man hardware.\nMotos is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFvFGV_HjL4\n¬†\nThe post Namco‚Äôs sci-fi bumper car classic Motos joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Along the way, she encounters nightmarish monsters and has to struggle to survive, while discovering her own lost dreams.\nCosmic horror\nIt's got some definite cosmic horror vibes, mixed with tech and sci-fi themes around seemingly artificial life. It all feels very space horror, which granted, there's been a decent amount of in the summer showcases so far.\nWhat struck me about¬†Signalis¬†when I demoed it for last year's Tribeca Games showcase was not just the aesthetic, though. (Granted, the aesthetic is fantastic.)\nIt's got some classic¬†Resident Evil¬†feel to it, with isometric viewpoints and carefully placing shots in slowly approaching monsters. It had a real \"every bullet counts\" approach that I dug. And the puzzle segments that dove into first-person kept things moving between the survival horror sections.\nRose-engine's space-based scare fest has been one of my most-anticipated indies for this year, and that hasn't changed yet. I'm looking forward to seeing the cosmic mysteries and horrors collide later this year.\nSignalis¬†will launch for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on October 27, 2022.\nThe post Signalis brings the sci-fi survival horror this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Grammys are singing their praises\nEven to those who don't regularly play video games, their music is iconic, and in many cases instantly recognizable. There are a ton of different factors that can make a game stand out as one of the greats, and a great soundtrack alone is enough to make a title stick in our heads for years to come. The Grammys are the most prestigious awards in music, and now they're finally giving video game music the credit that it's due.\nThe Recording Academy actually added five new categories that will be honored at the awards ceremony next year, including \"Songwriter of the Year,\" \"Best Spoken Word Poetry Album,\" \"Alternative Music Performance,\" \"Americana Music Performance,\" and of course, \"Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Interactive Media.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_329238\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1280\"] [Image Source: Nintendo Life][/caption]While this will be the first time that video game music will be honored in its own category, this is not the first time that score from a game has won a Grammy.\nMost recently, The 8-Bit Band took home \"Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Capella\" for their cover of Kirby Super Star's \"Meta Knight's Revenge\" earlier this year. Civilization IV composer Christopher Tin won the \"Best Instrumental Arrangement with a Vocalist\" award for the track \"Baba Yetu\" in 2010. Journey¬†composer Austin Wintory was nominated for the \"Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media\" award, but unfortunately didn't take home the win.\nHopefully now that games have an entire category of their own, the incredible work that game composers do will be recognized on a larger scale. Game composers have a whole new set of challenges to face when writing for interactive media, which, in my eyes at least, is really what makes it stand out from other types of scores.\nVideo games will always have awards for music within the industry, but taking home a Grammy award just hits different, I imagine.\nThe post The Grammy Awards just added a video game category appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's the allure of something new from Ojiro Fumoto, the creator of Downwell. The designer's last game was about strategically plummeting, and this new one, Poinpy, is about going up, up, up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDA33JqHIjE\nIf this is your first time, here's how it works: you can download Poinpy as a standalone app on Android or iOS, but to play it, you'll need a Netflix subscription (or someone's login). After launching the game, it'll ask you to sign into Netflix ‚Äî and even choose your individual profile if you're sharing your sub ‚Äî before playing. In other words, it's a self-contained experience and you don't even need the main Netflix app on your mobile device.\nAs the trailer shows, the idea is to flick your character upwards with a bit of a time crunch to keep the pressure on. You'll try to avoid accidentally colliding with foes while collecting certain combinations of fruit and climbing ever higher until your run comes crashing down and you go again. Much like Downwell, this quick-on-your-feet game is about being in the right place at the right time to keep your momentum flowing seamlessly without snags.\nIt's super vibrant, and while they look pretty different aesthetically speaking, Poinpy and Downwell feel like they belong on the same family tree. It's tricky! I'm not great at it.\nFumoto partnered with Netflix Games and Devolver Digital, and maybe if we're lucky we'll see Poinpy eventually land on other platforms. For now, though, this really feels like a game that was designed for touch controls. I'm sure it could work elsewhere just fine ‚Äî and that'd be cool ‚Äî but if you've got a Netflix account handy, give it a shot.\nHeh, \"Poinpy.\" Cute lil name.\nThe post Downwell creator teams up with Netflix for Poinpy, a game about going up appeared first on Destructoid.",

As you plunge deeper, both rocks and enemies will stand in your way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J19CpadX-Zk\nWhat appeals to me about¬†Ground Divers¬†is how it's adding some new ideas to the standard dig-action game.

The conference will be the occasion to announce several major projects, reveal new trailers and exclusive gameplay, and introduce new accessories that will delight all gamers.\"\nWhile Nacon is expected to reveal the show's itinerary at a later date, we can snugly assume that we'll be seeing updates on the cyber revolution RPG Steelrising, Daedalic's action-adventure title The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, and Teyon's previously teased RoboCop: Rogue City. Nacon promises new trailers, exclusive gameplay footage, and the debut of several new accessories from the company's hardware division.\nNacon Connect 2022 will go live on July 7 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST and can be watched on the official Nacon YouTube and Twitch channels. I may not be a \"renowned influencer\", but I'll also do my best to bring you any pertinent news from the stream right here on Destructoid.\nThe post Nacon Connect 2022 live stream will take place on July 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, he's here, in full Belmont garb and whip in tow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONqNEPTPyqU\nRichter is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, so that should make for an interesting continuation of the show. And longtime¬†Castlevania¬†fans are probably already very excited about¬†Nocturne¬†tackling Richter, considering his source material. Video game Richter means both¬†Rondo of Blood¬†and¬†Symphony of the Night¬†could be fodder for adaptation.\nThe series will be led by showrunner Kevin Kolde and creator/writer Clive Bradley, and produced by Project 51 Productions with production services from Powerhouse Animation.\nRondo round the world\nConsidering the¬†Castlevania¬†Netflix series has traditionally been a looser adaptation of the source material, I wouldn't expect¬†Castlevania: Nocturne¬†to be a full-on retelling of¬†Rondo of Blood¬†or¬†Symphony of the Night. That said, Richter alone provides a lot of fodder for potential story beats between those two games. Plus, having Richter here means we could see the return of Alucard. Who doesn't want that?\nWe got a tease of this last year, but it's excellent to see the¬†Castlevania¬†adaptations are carrying on. While the streaming service has had some standouts in the adaptation department,¬†Castelvania¬†remains one of my favorites. The storming-the-castle finale of Season 2 is forever seared in my brain.

          "description": "Coming to the Epic Games Store on PC\nDid you know there's an Epic Games Store showcase going on right now? Me neither!¬†More¬†Lord of the Rings-licensed games are on the way beyond that vague EA mobile project and the Gollum title; as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was just announced today.\nThe trailer opens up at the Doors of Durin, before showcasing a group of dwarves (players) quite literally heading back into Moria. Social elements (group drinking), survival moments (evading orcs that are still skulking about the halls), crafting, and building seem to be in play. Development is handled by Free Range Games, who has worked as an external developer on several titles, and handled primary development for Spelldrifter.\nHere's a quick description that sums up the vibe:\n\"To survive the treacherous mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain.\"\n\nEight-player co-op is on the table, which is likely one of the bigger selling points of Return to Moria for the studio. A spring 2023 window for the Epic Games Store is teased. The copyright is with Middle-earth Enterprises (not the Tolkien Estate), so like other similar projects, they'll be limited in what they can cover from The Legendarium (as is customary for the vast majority of Tolkien-related media). But given that the core book series pretty much gives them free rein on Moria, they should be good there.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75nbOL7GOPE\nThe post Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is a‚Ä¶Tolkien survival simulator? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Plus, with the next Dragon Age¬†game also heading Tevinter, the Netflix series could potentially set up storylines. Or it might just be a good entry point for newcomers. Either way, Tevinter is definitely an interesting place to go; it's a region full of magic, mystery, and intrigue.\nThe Dread Wolf nears\nAs for the¬†Dragon Age series in the gaming realm, BioWare recently announced the title for its next entry. Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be the next mainline game, with the player heading to Tevinter and dealing with a lingering threat in Solas.\nThe latest¬†Dragon Age¬†has been in development for a while, and BioWare has confirmed it won't launch in 2022. Basically, it's going to be a while before we get a new virtual adventure in Thedas. In the meantime, this streaming series will be something for fans to dig into and pick apart, at the least.\nDragon Age: Absolution¬†is another step of Netflix diving deeper into the world of video game adaptations, too. A new¬†Cyberpunk¬†anime was already announced, and its live-action¬†Resident Evil¬†adaptation arrives soon.

As a reminder, \"SP\" versions are modified editions of Switch Online NES or SNES games that essentially have a \"cheat/unlock\" save out of the box. That's really it.\nBreaking this down, here's what the Switch Online Kirby SP games do:\nKirby Super Star SP: You get Revenge of Meta Knight mode access immediately\nKirby's Dream Land 3 SP: An easier difficulty/extras are available\nKirby's Dream Course SP: Extras unlocked, including more multiplayer stages (this is probably the most useful of the three)\nSP versions started off as a cute little flight of fancy bonus, but at this point people are asking for an option to hide them entirely from the interface: which has become more unwieldy and bloated as more games have been added. Initially \"SP\" seemed like something special, like maybe an official ROM hack or a different edition of a classic game: but they turned out to just be, by and large, save-doctored retreads.\nAnother issue is that Nintendo potentially sees these as \"updates,\" which slows down future games from becoming part of the service sooner. It's tough to tell what the actual cadence of games is for the Switch Online service by any metric, as \"slow\" generally sums it up: from the launch of the NES service all the way to the current era of Nintendo 64 and Genesis.\nThe post Nintendo just added three new Kirby SP SNES games to Switch Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

The rekindling of the original Last of Us¬†was set to be the closer for Summer Game Fest.\nThe June State of Play held last week focused mainly on third-party titles, so it's no surprise people are curious about what Sony's first-party lineup looks like right now.

By redeeming 30 platinum here, you can print seven pages of stuff yourself, including \"eight invitations, four cupcake holders, six pennant flags, and six party toppers.\"\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here,¬†which has been updated with details on weekly missions:¬†bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.¬†A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that‚Äôs basically just 15 minutes with¬†Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "June 16 at 6PM ET\nSo remember when Geoff Keighly said that he thinks publishers have learned that they should probably have \"30 minutes plus\" conferences, or less micro-conferences in general? Well Square Enix has a 10 minute¬†Final Fantasy VII¬†stream planned for June 16 at 6PM ET.\nFor reference, here's the quote:\n‚ÄúThere were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren‚Äôt really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that‚Ä¶I think [they] have learned that if you‚Äôre going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that‚Äôs going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what‚Äôs coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general.‚Äù\n\nWelp!\nThe stream kicks off below at 6PM ET on June 16, with the following caveat from Tetsuya Nomura: \"At only around 10 minutes long, it will be short and sweet, but we have packed in lots of information, so I hope everyone can look forward to the unveiling.\" Add it to the pile! Less obvious candidates include a tease for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 or some new media project; more obvious candidates are mobile developments for VII-related projects.\nIf Square Enix¬†doesn't show anything related to Part 2¬† in this Final Fantasy VII stream, they're just setting themselves up for disappointment.

          "description": "Who's Bad?\nThe mysterious legacy of the Sonic 3 soundtrack has reared its head once again, as Sega has revealed that upcoming retro compilation Sonic Origins will not feature the original score from the 1994 release. Instead, Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature an \"adapted\" soundtrack, faithfully recreated by composer Jun Senoue.\nSonic fans had been awaiting news on the Sonic Origins soundtrack situation, well aware that Sonic 3 score is mired in misty red tape due to the alleged input of one Michael Jackson, who supposedly composed some of the game's tracks despite not actually being credited in-game. Since its release, both members of Michael Jackson's team and Sega executives have delivered mixed messages as to whether \"The King of Pop\" did indeed work on the best-selling Sega Mega Drive title, with no real confirmation either way.\nhttps://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1535011473218494487?s=20&t=PZcbCmTmIdkgAhJn58Zwnw\nIn a special Sonic Origins live stream held yesterday, social media manager Katie Chrzanowski clarified that the Sonic Origins edition of Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature a recomposed version of the original score, with Senoue even utilizing original Sega Mega Drive technology and his original collection of Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to truly capture that classic 16-bit feel.\nWhile the fact that Sonic 3 is not being 100% replicated in its entirety will be a disappointment to the fanbase, Senoue is one of the best in the biz, with no doubt that the tweaked score will be equally as compelling as the one that Jackson did... I mean did not... write.\nSonic Origins launches June 23 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Sonic Origins to feature an ‚Äòadapted‚Äô soundtrack for Sonic 3 & Knuckles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Welcome to Shit City (literally that's the name of the city)\nAfter a busy day of Summer Game Festing, I'm pretty much spent, but leave it to Devolver Digital (and Suda) to supercharge my brain for a bit with another chaotic showcase. On one extreme, we saw the adorable 2D-meets-3D storybook adventure The Plucky Squire ‚Äî and on the other, there was Anger Foot, a face-kicking action game for sickos.\nThe first gameplay glimpse from developer Free Lives (Broforce, GORN, Terra Nil) looks unhinged. I'm talking \"Academy Award winner Russell Crowe in Unhinged\" unhinged.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1XJv-pylk\nIt's one of the most no-bullshit, take-it-or-leave-it showings I've seen in a while, and I also appreciate the synopsis, which reinforces this game's unrelenting mood.\n\"Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies,\" as Devolver Digital and Free Lives put it. \"Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.\"\nI can already tell Anger Foot will be the kind of game where there's an ideal \"wow, that went smooth!\" way to play, and getting the flow down just right will surely take practice. In the meantime, I'm sure it'll be funny to fumble your way through these setups, too. If you've ever wondered how Hotline Miami would (or could) translate its frantic room-clearing carnage to 3D, well, this is probably the closest we're getting for now.\nGeneral mood aside, you don't need to take the reveal trailer's word for it ‚Äî there's a demo right now on Steam. Anger Foot is planning a 2023 release.\nThe post Anger Foot might be Devolver Digital‚Äôs most unhinged game yet appeared first on Destructoid.",

Skate Story¬†is a game about the latter, coming sometime in 2023.\nShown off during today's Devolver Digital summer showcase,¬†Skate Story¬†is about a deal with the devil. You, as a demon made of glass and pain, have to skate to the moon and swallow it to earn your freedom. Simple enough, right?\nSeeing it in motion, though, is something else. It's reminding me of¬†Thumper, but with chiller music and sick kickflips. I've probably watched the trailer below at least a half-dozen times already.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6j0zKSXAFE\nThe camera angle is absolutely wonderful too. Its shown in a way that reminds me of old skate videos. As you course through the underworld, you'll also get new decks, wheels, and trucks, as well as a host of tricks to really add some style to your cruising.\nSkating through it all\nSkateboarding games are always interesting to me, but even over the last couple years, skating has been reimagined in some fascinating ways.¬†The Ramp¬†put a minimalist spin on just the raw action. And¬†OlliOlli World¬†takes a level-based approach with a story and goals that really added a lot to the experience.\nThat's what excites me about¬†Skate Story¬†in this trailer. It's a whole different vibe, and one I'm really gelling with the more I see it. Developer Sam Eng has posted some great technical looks at the tricks in play, and they are just a joy to watch.\nhttps://twitter.com/skatestorygame/status/1486147388255395840\nSuffice to say, I'm looking forward to nailing some sick tricks in the surreal dream world of¬†Skate Story¬†when it arrives in 2023.

In between skits about Mecha-Suda51 and the convergence of all video games, Massive Monster's adorable roguelike-meets-management game finally locked in a release date. We also got a new animated trailer here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI6D2iYCTcU\nA demo for¬†Cult of the Lamb¬†is live on Steam today too, ahead of its August launch date. That way you can try out taking over the woods before you buy all the way in.\nBuilding up a new following\nCult of the Lamb¬†follows a little lamb, who narrowly avoids being destroyed only to become beholden to a dark spirit. Paying back your debt means assisting this spirit in taking over the woodlands and destroying the other prophets.\nAlong the way, you can recruit a following of other happy creatures to do your bidding. That means harvesting crops, building new structures, and gradually constructing a quaint home base you can visit between escapades.\n\nIt's a cool town-building twist on the usual action-roguelike formula. I got to demo a build at PAX East earlier this year, and was really own over both by its style and its compelling management.\nAs the summer showcases start to ramp up, it's nice to see a cool project get locked in for a release date, and so soon at that.

Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.\n\n\nUnlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino's body of work and other¬†classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can't let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners' street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.\nIf you're ready to aid¬†and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.\nAs Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.\nBeyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.\nBeyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you‚Äôve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.\nAs Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.\nArctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.",

Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.\nThe studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger ‚Äì all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game‚Äôs footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.\nThe studio describes a focus on ‚ÄúDavid vs. Goliath‚Äù bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the N√§cken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the N√§cken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him ‚Äì including the girl that he loved.\nBased on the description explored in the trailer, it‚Äôs clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster‚Äôs narratives as part of the unfolding game. The N√§cken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.\nThe footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.\nDimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.\nBramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.",

The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.\nThe Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair.¬†Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes¬†gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it's strangely impressive how gross some details of these¬†attacks come off in the pixel low-rez¬†art.\nFollowing a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.\nWe don't have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Join Game Informer as we chat with Maja Moldenhauer, studio director at Studio MDHR, about the exciting DLC, the new bosses players will be facing, and what the developers are planning on for the future.\n\n\nAlex Stadnik is here to ask the burning questions fans might have. The two start things off by discussing what the team brought to Summer Game Fest and chat about the ins and outs of the Mortimer Freeze boss fight. They then discuss what players can expect from the five major fights found in The Delicious Last Course and how the stages change the experience from the main game.\nThey then move to Ms. Chalice, the new character that isn't a carbon copy of the title's namesake or Mugman. One of the main additions of the DLC streamlines the experience with a new moveset and abilities but is far from an easy mode. Players will have to sacrifice some of the buffs they were used to in the main game in order to use her as she's activated as a charm.\nThe two also discuss how Studio MDHR developed the game through COVID, how the soundtrack is yet again a highlight, and whether or not players can expect new secrets when they boot up the DLC on June 30. Finally, Stadnik and Maja round out the interview and briefly discuss what's next for the studio.\nIf you enjoyed this look at Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, be sure to check out our recent preview impressions, our talk about the DLC on this week's GI Show, and our fresh episode of New Gameplay Today showing off the Mortimer Freeze boss fight!

Today, during the Netflix Geeked livestream, we got our first look at a successor series called Castlevania: Nocturne. Set hundreds of years after the original series, Richter Belmont takes up the whip and will continue the fight of his ancestors. Richter is the protagonist of the 1993 video game, Castlevania Rondo of Blood (also known as Dracula X). He is also of the same bloodline as the Sypha and Trevor from Netflix's first series.\nNocturne is executive produced by Kevin Kolde, with Sam Deats in the director's chair with assistant director Adam Deats. In the show, Richter will be searching for vampires in 1792 in the midst of the French Revolution. He won't be alone in his journey: Maria Renard is also along for this dark ride.\nAre you a fan of Netflix's Castlevania work?

Furthermore, the publication reports that two of those three people expect PlayStation to announce an exact release date later this month.¬†\n\n\nRagnarok was originally due out in 2021, according to its 2020 reveal, but Sony delayed it to 2022 in June of last year.

As for what to expect, the answer is simple: Final Fantasy VII. This could be a stream specifically about the original release, which hit store shelves 25 years ago. But, as any Final Fantasy fan knows (and if you‚Äôre like me, hopes), we might hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake, or rather, its sequel.¬†\nJoin us next week for around 10 minutes to celebrate 25 years of @FinalFantasy VII: https://t.co/y074ldZMhg\n#FFVII25th.

I‚Äôm betting the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Of course, the company could just reveal some new Final Fantasy VII merch or even more about the upcoming Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, a mobile take on the beloved game, so it‚Äôs best to keep your expectations in check. Only time will tell for now, though.¬†\nIn the meantime, read Game Informer‚Äôs Final Fantasy VII Remake review, and then check out this story about Nomura promising ‚Äúeven more new FFVII projects‚Äù in the future.¬†\nAre you excited about this broadcast?

Since 2020, developer Sam Eng has been slowly revealing the game on their own personal Twitter and the official Skate Story account. For the most part, these have been small gameplay videos. But today's trailer finally gives us a peek at the game's story ‚Äì or at least its general premise. That being, per the trailer, \"You are a demon made of glass and pain and yet you must skate.\" What more could you need? More than that, we got extended looks at gameplay, including the unique art style. The camera angle¬†and shake also look about as close to a real skate video as any video game's gotten thus far.\nI don't mean to gush over a game I haven't played yet, but I can't wait to get my hands on Skate Story.

          "description": "Today‚Äôs Summer Game Fest presentation brought several small but important details coming to The Last of Us universe, including some details about what is now a standalone multiplayer title set within the post-apocalyptic setting.\nOriginally, a multiplayer component was planned for inclusion in the release of The Last of Us Part 2. But before that game released, Naughty Dog opted to cut that portion of the game and instead focus on the campaign. At the time, it was also clear that the multiplayer experience was likely still in the works, and was expanding in scope. Today‚Äôs reveal makes clear that expansion has broadened out to be its own full game.\nThe game has been in the works for roughly two years as of now. It includes a new cast of characters, though many of the tools those characters are using seem to be similar to those we saw in the campaign of The Last of Us Part 2; the characters¬†wield rifles and Molotov cocktails even as chaos unfolds on the overgrown streets below them.\nNaughty Dog‚Äôs Neil Druckmann was open in admitting that they would not be sharing extensive details on the project at this time, but did share a piece of concept art that showed survivors overlooking what appears to be the city of San Francisco.\nWe still have something of a wait before we‚Äôll be able to play the game, as Druckmann implied we‚Äôd be seeing more of the project sometime next year in 2023.\nEarlier today, a leak helped confirm that The Last of Us Remake is on the way, and today's Summer Game Fest also confirmed that progress is continuing with The Last of Us TV show, starring Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, as well as news that the game's vocal stars, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, would be taking on some meaningful roles in the TV project.",

This lengthy look showed off traversal, combat, and a brief taste of what we could expect from the upgrade system. At today's Summer Game Fest, a new trailer debuted, giving us a deeper look at Nightwing's gameplay.\nWith Batman supposedly dead, Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood have banded together to keep Gotham's streets safe. Nightwing was long an understudy of Batman and also trained as a trapeze artist as a child.¬† In the new footage, we see both of these influences in his fighting style. He's brutal at close range, can create distance with his acrobatic flexibility, and has gadgets galore at his disposal.\nIn most of the gameplay, he's in his traditional black and blue garb, but we also get a brief look at him in a different ninja-like suit, which you'll be able to craft by gathering specific components.\nGotham Knights is slated to release on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and also PC. I hope it lives up the Arkham series' legacy, but also hope the inclusion of cooperative play gives it a new identity that is every bit as enthralling.",

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks ‚Äì and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students!
