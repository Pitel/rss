As an adult, \"sandbox\" either means \"a game that lets you choose most of your goals\" or \"ant-filled nightmare that gets your child all gritty\", depending on whether or not you have kids.\nDon't worry. Today, we're focusing on sandbox-as-in-video-game, a genre of entertainment in which most of the enjoyment is derived from setting your own targets. Sandboxes range from the no-direction-at-all end of the spectrum, like Garry's Mod (a PC-only asset toybox), through the some-direction games like Minecraft and Astroneer, all the way to games that hold your hand or guide you a lot more towards goals, like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Probably not, honestly.\nMore than five years after its initial launch, the Switch has amassed a vast library of first-party games from Nintendo, including the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. What's apparent with these titles, however (and indeed the entire first-party catalogue), is that none of them have been granted a permanent price drop. It's no surprise either, since all of them are still selling pretty well for the most part, which ultimately begs the question: does Nintendo even need to drop the price on their games?\nThe short answer is no, probably not. But you're not here for the short answer! In the below video, the delightful Zion, Alex, and Felix spend a good 36 minutes discussing this very topic, exploring the reasoning for and against price drops, the value that games provide in comparison to films or TV shows, and regional price conversions.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This time it's a reimagining of the original 1992 game, where you'll delve into Derceto Manor as returning characters Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby in an attempt to figure out what's happened to Hartwood's missing uncle. As you'd expect, it does not go terribly well. But hey, it looks like it makes for a pretty good time.\nRead more",

          "description": "As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is landing on PC, and it’s pretty good! Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port's development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.\nRead more",

I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. \nIt tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.\nRead more",

          "description": "We'll soon return to the weird and wonderful world of Cosmo D's Off-Peak City, with the next game in the series today announcing a shiny release date of September 9th. Betrayal At Club Low is the name, and an RPG infiltrating a former coffin factory-turned-nightclub is its game. This time, Cosmo D says he's inspired by one-shot indie RPGs as we roll dice, bake pizzas, and try to help an undercover agent escape.\nRead more",

All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

I've crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that's now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds.

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.\nIn fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question \"what games would you play for the first time again?\" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory?

Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

          "description": "Hopefully it lives up to the series' potential\nAvatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most beloved TV series of all time (and for good reason), and it's about damn time it got another video game adaptation. This week Square Enix and Navigator Games announced that they're collaborating on an Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game for Android and iOS, which is launching in Canada, South Africa, and Sweden this month ahead of a wider release.\nThe game, titled Avatar: Generations, will be a free-to-play RPG that will include squad-based battles and in-game adventure sequences (whatever that means), according to GameSpot. Players will be able to explore an open world, as well as relive iconic story moments from the show as well. We can also expect to see all of our favorite characters like Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa, and Momo. Future updates will give players access to Avatar Kyoshi, Korra, Roku, and explore all four of the nations.\n\nSquare Enix and Navigator put up an official website for the Avatar: Generations, although it's basically empty as of now, so it's worth coming back to in a bit when they release more information. There's also no hint as to when the full release of Generations might be, but considering it's a mobile launch, odds are it won't take as long as the typical game releases we're used to.\nI'm honestly shocked that the games industry hasn't given ATLA more love up until this point, considering how big and enthusiastic the fanbase is. I'm sure most of us would prefer a full AAA treatment over an Avatar mobile game, but it's a good place to start.\nThere have certainly been some good mobile games based on bigger franchises in the past few years — Fallout Shelter being chief among them. Hopefully if Generations does well, some of the bigger studios will catch on to the potential that this franchise has to make some really kickass games.\nThe post An Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game is launching this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s not a sequel, but the aesthetics, the characters, and even the UI call back to their first title. It reminds me of Maxis in the ‘90s before and directly after EA got their evil all over them. A lot of the games sprung up around SimCity, and while not all of them were as directly related as the ones from Two Point Studios, some were tied together, even if it was just in a reference.\nI’ve been eagerly waiting for the next step in the Two Point experience.

Some big Twitch stream requests recently have been Cult of the Lamb, Lamentum, a few horror sequels, and horror-adjacent games like Martha is Dead.\nI decided to go with Martha today because if we're lucky, we can get through most if not all of it, whereas the other ones will take at least two streams. I'm still interested in Cult of the Lamb, though, so we'll likely see that soon.\n\nSome of you described Martha is Dead as a gripping and atmospheric psychological thriller, which is exactly a part of what we like here, so I'll see you tonight to check it out!\nDrop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 7:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.\nThe post We’re streaming Martha is Dead tonight appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hybrid Heaven is metallic corridors from eyebrows to toe-hairs. But something about the way he was enjoying it was infectious.\nAfter he completed it, he told me that “he probably wouldn’t have tolerated it without save states.” That is not glowing praise, but the experience was enough to keep Hybrid Heaven rolling around in my head for years until I finally found it for a reasonable price.

          "description": "A late start to the new term\nThe start to a new year at Hogwarts will be slightly delayed. Open-world magic RPG Hogwarts Legacy has hit a new delay, and is now aiming for a February 10, 2023 launch.\nIt's the latest 2022 game to get hit with a delay into next year, and it comes with an addendum too. While the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions of Hogwarts Legacy are set for February 10, 2023, the Nintendo Switch version has no date. News about the Switch's date will be revealed soon, the Hogwarts team says.\nhttps://twitter.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1558121248814759939\nIt's the latest delay for Avalanche Software's game, which had already been pushed out of 2021 and into this year. We did get a gameplay deep dive earlier this year, where we saw a bit of what wizards and witches can get up to in the wizarding world. But it looks like players will be waiting a bit longer to get their owl.\nBack to school\nThe delay isn't totally out of the ordinary, as several major 2022 games have been moving out and into later dates. Earlier this week, Firaxis and 2K confirmed that Marvel's Midnight Suns has been delayed out of its October date, only specifying that it will launch sometime before the end of March '23.\nEven Metal Slug Tactics is taking a little extra time. Only a few, like God of War Ragnarok, are standing firm in this coming holiday window.\nA little extra time will hopefully at least be good for the team, in helping them deliver the experience they want to. I'm admittedly not too keen on Hogwarts Legacy, especially as it's based on a series whose author seems determined to keep chipping away at any goodwill the books garnered. WB Games did note in 2020 that Rowling isn't directly involved in the game. But hey. There's always Witchbrook.\nThe post Hogwarts Legacy has been pushed back to February 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Revealed at today's THQ Nordic showcase, the goal of Space for Sale is to land on distant planets, spot good plots for new estates, and flip them for massive profit.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36zqJyOBCqA\nOf course, the local wildlife is not too keen on you turning their natural habitat into a trendy downtown district. As you build up, it looks like you'll need to also keep an eye out for danger. The local flora and fauna can be tamed and researched though, eventually leading to breakthroughs on how to thrive in these biomes.\nBuilding a new neighborhood\nSpace for Sale will let you explore procedurally generated landscapes, discovering natural resources to harvest and turn into estates. Establishing power lines and construction areas is important, as is satisfying the customers.\nDrop-in, drop-out multiplayer will also make it easy for a friend to hop and help construct that new living area alongside you. Everything's a bit easier to do with more hands, right?\n\nHonestly, Space for Sale looks like a really fun time.

The 2001 role-playing game is coming back on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and whether you're in or not will likely depend on your connection to the original back in the day — or maybe a fascination with of-their-time games returning with glossed-up remasters or remakes.\nHere's a cinematic trailer to (re)introduce the mining colony and the Minecrawlers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf4Wd29mRqw\nPlayers will \"manage the fate of a lifetime convicted prisoner who must survive in a world of wild animals, creatures, and convicts of dangerous reputation.\"\nGame developer Alkimia Interactive promises a \"modernized combat system\" for Gothic 1 Remake, though it hopes to retain an overall \"faithful\" vibe. That's a tricky balancing act for any revival, especially one with a cult following. 20 years can be an eternity in gaming.\nIn December 2019, THQ Nordic released a Gothic Playable Teaser on Steam, which generated no shortage of fan feedback to take into consideration. As a first introduction, it arguably missed the mark. But as a public test, I think it served its purpose.\nDespite this latest promotional push, Gothic 1 Remake doesn't have a release date. It's still tagged with a vague \"coming soon\" on Steam, and will also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S — when it's ready.

Pieces Interactive is heading up development, as part of THQ Nordic under the Embracer Group umbrella.\nAlone in the Dark will return to the Derceto Manor, with an original story that will still feature some characters and themes from the '90s trilogy.\nPlayers can once again play as either Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood. Levels and cutscenes will change, depending on which character you're controlling at that moment in time.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acch6-3QEWs\nPieces Interactive will try to capture a gothic American South look, mixed in with noir, the Roaring '20s, and Lovecraftian horror. Mikael Hedberg, the writer behind Soma and Amnesia, is on board to pen the story for Alone in the Dark.\nYou are not alone (in the dark)\nDetails about the new game leaked out early today, ahead of the official reveal. While some of the wind was taken out of the sails there, it does seem like people are eager to see what Alone in the Dark will do with this second wind.\n\nRemakes and reimaginings have gone pretty well for the survival horror genre as well. At least, they have for Resident Evil, which has been seeing steady remakes of many of its numbered games, with Resident Evil 4 due up next.\nAlone in the Dark, meanwhile, has toiled in the shadows for a while. It hasn't seen a new entry since 2015's Alone in the Dark: Illumination, which was not very well-received. Even the entry before it didn't go quite so well.\nA return to the roots of the series might be what Alone in the Dark needs.

          "description": "Dana Carvey isn't the only Master of Disguise\nAfter encountering hundreds of Yiga clan members in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I never really thought twice about them. Well, justlookingfordragon did!\nAmazingly, the entire exercise is framed as a self-imposed mission, as many Breath of the Wild activities often are. In this case, they opted to take photos of the Yiga clan imposters they find out on their travels, then track them down based on those photos. As they point out, \"none of the Yiga impersonate 'important' characters: most are just wandering people with a couple lines of random dialogue.\" This actually kind of fits with the theme of just blinding in by taking an ordinary person's identity.\n\nZelda: Breath of the Wild Yiga clan mystery solved\nIt turns out justlookingfordragons also seemingly figured out better ways to spot the Yiga imposters. They actually only double as Hylians or Hylian-adjacent races (which might be something you already noticed, but is nice to get confirmation on after all this research), and never take the identity of a child or an older resident (or any other race).\nThey even provided a helpful map (above) for spotting stationary Breath of the Wild Yiga clan members — and you can save and load using a campfire to reset them. If you're remotely interested in how the Yiga clan operates, the breakdown is worth the full read. Hopefully they return in the sequel!\nThe post Someone cracked the code on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Yiga imposters and it’s fascinating appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kobayashi shared the news with friends, fans, and followers on Twitter earlier today, which just so happens to be the producer's 50th birthday.\n\"I would like to share something very special with everyone,\" began Kobayashi. \"After serving 27 years with gratitude, I have departed from Capcom on March 31st and will officially be joining NetEase Games as a producer. I will strive to continuously create more enjoyable entertainment experiences for everyone at this new company, in this new era. Thank you for your continued support.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/HiroKobaP/status/1557895229021118464?s=20&t=JvBOIN8mOUhnj9NNktzWaQ\nIn the near-three decades spent with Capcom, Kobayashi has worked alongside some of the company's most successful and recognizable brands. Kobayashi started out as a key coder for the groundbreaking survival horror title Resident Evil, with the following years seeing him rise through Capcom's ranks as a planner, associate producer, and eventually executive producer on titles such as Dino Crisis, killer7, Devil May Cry, and the Sengoku Basara franchise.\nKobayashi's move to NetEase Games can be seen as another step in the studio's desire to become a bigger play both within the games industry and on the global stage. NetEase already works as a China-based partner to Activision Blizzard, and recently announced the opening of its first U.S.-based studio, Jackalope Games. NetEase Games has been searching for notable staff members over the past year, which included courting Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi. Nagoshi now operates his own studio as a NetEase subsidiary.\nThe post Legendary Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi leaves studio for NetEase appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before that though, fans who are attending the 2022 Pokemon World Championships in London will be able to see it at a screening event at 6PM BST on August 19.\nHere's the synopsis:\n\"A visit to the Sinnoh region turns into a high-stakes adventure when Ash, Pikachu, and friends join forces with powerful Pokemon to confront a looming threat! When Ash, Goh, and Dawn receive a mysterious message from the Mythical Pokemon Arceus, they meet up with Brock and head to Mount Coronet to investigate. There, they find a rampaging Heatran and the commanders of Team Galactic, who are determined to find their missing leader by opening a gate between dimensions.\"\n\nI kind of love the idea of mining a previous region/generation for more story, just like the Pokemon Legends game did before. Given the immense success of Legends, I think there are more of those types of games in the pipeline as we speak. As for the animated tie-in, while I haven't kept up on every single episode of the long, long, long-running Pokemon series proper, I do generally watch all the films and specials — particularly the ones that are on YouTube for free.

It's the first code that highlights Ash's team, and more codes will come later for Dragonite (August 26), Gengar (September 2), Sirfetch'd (September 9), and Lucario (September 16). It's a neat little promo that also hits a little close to the anime, which is cool. The code is \"GANJ0UAG0882,\" and you'll enter it via the mystery gift system.\nWith that in mind, I hope Nintendo and Game Freak step things up with Scarlet and Violet. These sorts of themed distribution events are really easy to do and should happen way more often. Ideally, none of them will require anyone to step foot in a GameStop! Currently, we're 1/1 on that, with the aforementioned Pikachu event serving as a basic incentive to just pick the game up before the end of February.\nWith a lot of the innovations from Pokemon Legends already in everyone's collective mindset, Scarlet and Violet have a lot to prove; especially when it comes to open-world exploration.\n\nThe post You can get Ash’s Dracovish in a Pokemon Sword and Shield distribution appeared first on Destructoid.",

The fun is universal, as each character below is shown being attacked by ink in real life, and fights back with some weapon at their immediate disposal. That includes an umbrella (Brella), bow and arrow (Tri-Stringer), bucket (Slosher), and a brush (Octobrush).\nThey really nail the vibe of Splatoon, and have made me more excited for the next entry than a lot of the official announcements so far. There's something special about hearing the Splatoon soundtrack, listening to that ink noise, and seeing the actual ink color that hits that nostalgia center. I mean Splatoon is \"only\" seven years old, but that's nearly a decade folks! Pretty soon that'll enter \"retro\" territory, depending on where you draw the line.\nEither way, I'm just happy that Splatoon survived, and wasn't a casualty of the Wii U's fantastic fireball of a death.\nSplatoon 3 Brella commercial:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKsWdGeBDYI\nSplatoon 3 Tri-Stringer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1F2N6ihdEk\nSplatoon 3 Slosher:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNBudJb79PY\nSplatoon 3 Octobrush:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYurKPptDm4\nThe post Once again Japan gets the coolest commercials, this time for Splatoon 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the early '90s, Sunsoft began developing and publishing titles for the 16-bit market, creating a slew of, frankly, exceedingly middling platformers, brawlers, and adventure games for the Sega Genesis and SNES. Perhaps Sunsoft's best-known character is the platforming star Aero the Acro-Bat.\nSunsoft would enter a period of bankruptcy in 1995, but has always remained in the industry, albeit in an incredibly scaled-down capacity. Just last year, the company asked fans which of its classic IPs they would like to see receive a remaster or remake, so it's quite possible that next week's presentation will see the company announce several comebacks for the studio's portfolio of titles.\nThe Sunsoft digital event will take place on Thursday, August 18 at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST and can be watched on the official Sunsoft YouTube channel. We will, of course, be sure to bring you all of the details right here on Destructoid.\nThe post Old-school studio Sunsoft to announce new titles next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio's had a fair bit of experience working on fighting games, and it shows in Rumbleverse.\nThe 40-person grappler royale has players rush throughout a city, grabbing special magazines full of moves to then employ against other players. Melee weapons like bats and chairs are also in the mix, of course.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOmxeeyRsI\nThere's a standard battle royale mode, or Solo Mode, as well as a recently revealed Duos Mode where players can team up. There's also a Playground Mode, which will let users explore Grapital City at their own place. It's kind of like the training room equivalent, for this wide world of wrestling.\nTotal knockout\nRumbleverse is free-to-play as well, and it has crossplay enabled. You can also form cross-platform parties for Duos, though you'll need to add each other through the Epic Games Launcher to make that happen. The FAQ on Iron Galaxy's site has an easy-to-follow rundown for how to make that happen.\nWhile the game launches today, its first season kicks off next week on August 18, with a Battle Pass available for purchase then. There are also special bundles for Rumbleverse, if you want to start out with some extra cosmetics and shop bucks.\nFortnite may potentially be getting Goku, but for those who really want to brawl, seems like Rumbleverse is a solid option.

While Super Smash Con (or \"SSC\") is primarily a tournament-based event, there's some other activities on offer that people can enjoy separately, or while waiting for the next match to start. Here's a look at Super Smash Con 2022.\n\nSo one of my favorite elements of Smash Con (or any con really) is the dealer area, and that hasn't changed.

          "description": "Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. \nDevil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.\nCheck it out for yourself below: \nWelcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD\nAugust 11, 2022\nAs you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18. \nFor more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, check out the game’s first extended gameplay reveal from earlier this summer, and then read our preview of the game after checking it out in June. Read about the ways to get into the early access betas for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 after that. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nWhat do you think of this map? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). \nNightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. \nSo far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.",

Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.\nYour role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.\nNo More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.\nSoccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.\nLet us know what you think of this surprising game announcement in the comments section below!",

Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. \n\n\nSnow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge.

          "description": "Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery.

The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we'll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.\nThe official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine's Day and the second arriving in April. \nRunning faster, flying higher, and punching harder. #SonicMovie3 hits theatres on December 20, 2024. pic.twitter.com/DcFGbaKUao\nAugust 9, 2022\nThe tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. \nDecember 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega's mascot. \nYou can read our review of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 here.",

We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. \nThe new level is called \"Bean Hill Zone\" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a \"Bean Hill Zone\" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.\nThose aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.\nThis isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.\nFall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.",

A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it.

The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period.

If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. \nHowever, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. \nWhile waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack.

Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions.

Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing.

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",

My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.\nMMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. \nI’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. \nIf you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.\nHere are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: \nMonster Hunter World: 18.3 million \nResident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million\nMonster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million\nResident Evil 2: 9.8 million\nMonster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million \nResident Evil 5: 8.3 million\nResident Evil 6: 8.3 million\nStreet Fighter V: 6.6 million\nResident Evil Village: 6.4 million\nStreet Fighter II: 6.3 million\nAs you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. \nNow that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March. \n[Source: MyNintendoNews]\nAre you surprised by this list? Let us know in the comments below!",

It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. \nSince the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: \nGet ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!\nhttps://t.co/kbnwKv1n5m pic.twitter.com/NoVvqUzSTp\nAugust 4, 2022\nAs you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II.
