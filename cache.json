          "description": "Press 'X' to Neva.\nIn the first of couple years of the Switch, one of the standout indie games was an artsy little platformer called GRIS, which combined simple gameplay with incredible visuals to make for a memorable and touching experience. It feels fitting, then, that developer Nomada Studio has managed to produce and release a spiritual successor called Neva in the twilight of the Switch’s lifespan, bookending its time in the spotlight with another artistic experience that very much carries on the essence of Gris and expands upon it in some notable ways. Though it won’t last you terribly long, Neva is a memorable, emotional, and beautiful adventure that we’d suggest you pick up as soon as you can.\nThe game follows the story of a lone swordswoman named Alba and her titular wolf companion, Neva. Their journey begins when the wolf is just a pup with the two of them and Neva’s mother exploring a beautiful landscape, only for the group to be accosted by a furious storm of shadow demons. They bravely hold their own, but the Neva’s mother is killed in the onslaught. Mourning the loss, Alba and Neva make it out relatively unscathed, and the two then set out on a long journey to fight back against the encroaching corruption that the shadow demons bring to the land.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After a decent follow-up a few years ago with Ys IX, Falcom has now opted to squeeze out one more new entry for the Switch before its much-awaited successor inevitably steals the spotlight. Ys X: Nordics provides yet another strong, enjoyable adventure for Adol and Dogi, effortlessly demonstrating that there’s still a lot of life left in this long-running franchise.\nYs X places you once again in the shoes of the famed red-haired adventurer Adol Christin, who’s travelling with his friends Dogi and Dr. Flair to Celceta to help the doctor with some restorative flowers research. The group is travelling by boat through the Obelia Gulf, but are soon accosted by some Normans—a seafaring group of local enforcers who both maintain order and bully locals. Adol and his party end up landbound after the conflict, but his woes worsen when a Norman leader named Karja attempts to duel Adol on the beach and the two become inseparably bound together by a pair of magical ‘Mana Cuffs’ that they can’t remove.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The port never materialised, but it seems developer Psychose Interactive has pivoted to the modern market as it has announced that Forgotten Memories: Remastered Edition will be coming to Switch on 28th October.\nThis remaster takes the base mobile game and gives it what appears to be a pretty substantial facelift. The upcoming release is treated to updated visuals, new advanced lighting effects, a revamped score, gameplay improvements and a new 'Insane' game mode, amongst other tweaks. In short, if you were waiting for it on Wii U, this certainly seems like it'll be the best way to play.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Because, let's not forget, the OG Switch reveal kicked off with a strange photo of Mario peeking around a curtain — something former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang were keen to unpack on the latest episode of their podcast (thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything).\nAccording to the pair's answer, the photo was \"very controversial\", with Nintendo worrying the image wouldn't adequately manage people's expectations. According to Kit, \"You always need more assets than you think you do\" with a big announcement like a console reveal, but Nintendo didn't have anything fitting for this occasion so had to turn to a \"last-second\" photoshoot.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country.

It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure.

          "description": "Paradox Interactive delayed jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.\nSpeaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have \"higher expectations\" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.\n Read more",

But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been \"mythologised\" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply \"wouldn't fly today\".\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\".

While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.\nAnd then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also free from Itch here.\nRead more",

You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.\nRead more",

Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.\nMetaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.\nRead more",

I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.\nAt the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.\nRead more",

I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.\nLurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. \r\n \nRead more",

It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary.

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun. \r\n \nRead more",

Here are all the ways in which you can unlock Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.\n\n\nHow to Unlock Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero\n\n\nSimilarly to Goku Black, you can unlock Fused Zamasu in Sparking Zero by either purchasing him from the game's shop for 120,000 Zeni (only after reaching Player Level 20) or by summoning Super Shenron, heading to ”I want more characters” and then selecting him. For those looking to prioritize Goku Black when making their wish, it's important to point out that not having Fused Zamasu as an unlocked character won't stop you from performing his fusion. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nUnlike your player level, which will be raised after each battle, those who purchased the game's standard and Collector's editions will be able to unlock Super Shenron in Sparking Zero by completing the main path of Goku's storyline (or Episode Battle). Those who purchased the game's Ultimate Edition, on the other hand, will be able to perform one summon from the get-go. You will also get free summons by completing both the Future Trunks and Jiren Episode Battles. \n\n\nCan you unlock the Gohan Black variant of Fused Zamasu?\n\n\nSeen during Gohan's The Strongest Warrior Sparking! Episode, it is currently impossible to unlock the Gohan Black variant of Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, although the only difference between the two seems to be in the character's voice and hairstyle. \n\nThe post How to Unlock Fused Zamasu in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero appeared first on Destructoid.",
