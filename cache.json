Sometimes you get a drone-type companion who helps break down fences, though it also gets eaten by certain monsters. Then there are the orbs – Cocoon’s point of difference. Each contains a world you can carry around with you, both forming part of puzzles and containing puzzles within. One orb’s land is filled with prismatic crystals, another contains puddles and reeds, another is a gooey membranous underworld.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.\r\n\n\r\nThe new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In The Lamplighters League, three evil factions are gathering the power to seize an apocalyptic tower, and you must stop them by finding and trashing their power bases. They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That's a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.\nRead more",

Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.\nIt also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.\nRead more",

It's a question I've been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. \nHappily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.\nRead more",

          "description": "After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.\nStill, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.\nRead more",

It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.\nAssassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.\nRead more",

My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.\nIf I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.\nRead more",

          "description": "Larian have released a new Baldur's Gate 3 update which - in news that will surely lead to V-Day-style mass celebrations throughout the forts and dungeons of Faerûn - removes the loathed shared stash system introduced by Patch 3, which caused companions to dump their entire inventories on you when dismissed. The new patch reverts companion behaviour to their pre-Patch 3 behaviour, for a less frustrating RPG experience. In even more momentous tidings, it re-shaves that cat everybody loves. Ah, videogames.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Designed by Volker Wertich, one of the original creators of The Settlers, the new village 'em up puts you in charge of medieval tribes scattered around an almost eerily scenic island chain. \r\n\n\r\nIt's all about the little touches: check out those azure windmill blades, flickering in the breeze! And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god. But let's not do that. Let's play the demo instead. It gives you three maps, and lands ahead of the game's early access launch on 13th December.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with \"what happens when you survive the un-survivable,\" as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.\n\"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room,\" says Stokalski. \"And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

          "description": "FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. \nRegardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.\nRead more",

It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. \nI was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.\nRead more",

Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. \r\n\n\r\nI've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: \"Totally Fucked\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

These 2.0 bookshelf speakers normally go for $199, but today you can apply a $40 coupon on the product page to bring these speakers down to... $159, if my maths are correct. That's a solid deal for speakers that come with a litany of positive critic and user reviews.\nRead more",

I felt that way about Detective Pikachu Returns this week, and I'm one of the few who actually played the original (that's just how 2023 is going! It's an onslaught, folks). But even if you don't partake in the recently-released digital follow-up, you can still order a Pokemon-branded coffee cup cozy soon.\n\n\nMy Nintendo just posted a hype blog for Detective Pikachu Returns, which includes details for Switch Online icons (which include a few general-purpose Pokemon avatars) and printable stationary/wallpapers, as well as a new My Nintendo physical reward: the aforementioned coffee cozy. It's yellow, it's cute, and it'll fit around a cup. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that it's not random big box store Pikachu merch, because this rat even has a hat; and there's magnifying glass/lightbulb imagery to let you know that the cozy is from Detective Pikachu.\n\n\nHere are all the details we have from Nintendo:\n\n\n\n\"Everyone knows that Detective Pikachu loves coffee—now he can keep yours warm (or cold!) with this adorable Detective Pikachu Returns Cup Cozy. This physical reward is coming. Stay Tuned!\"\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the My Nintendo storefront is concerned, \"stay tuned\" could mean anywhere from 1-7 days for the actual listing to pop up. While a Platinum Point price hasn't popped up yet, the lowest-cost comparable item in the store currently is 400p, so expect it to be in the 400-1000 range when it arrives.\n\n\nIf you need more platinum, we got you covered!\n\nThe post My Nintendo will be stocking a Pikachu Returns coffee cozy soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Get ready to lose even more time in the game’s character creator, as Hotfix #9 introduces name changes to Baldur's Gate 3 and lets you adjust the appearance of Hirelings now, too.\n\n\n\n\nMirror, mirror on the wall\n\n\nThe Magic Mirror has always been a useful camp item in Baldur’s Gate 3. If you get tired of your Tav’s current look, the Magic Mirror will let you change things up. Now, though, the Mirror will let you adjust arguably the most important aspect of your character: their name. That’s right, no more bemoaning the fact that you weren’t feeling creative when you started your campaign. Tav can finally get a truly unique name, like Frank or Jane. \n\n\nEven if you’re fully satisfied with your current character, this latest hotfix will still give you a reason to check out the Magic Mirror. You can finally use it to adjust the look of any hirelings that you decided to bring along on your journey. Anyone who didn’t get their character create itch satisfied at the beginning of the game can now dive back into the creator with a new character all over again. \n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is the gift that keeps on giving. Larian Studios blew everyone away when it released the game in August, and since then a steady stream of updates and hotfixes have been addressing fan concerns and cleaning up minor bugs throughout the game’s massive world.\n\n\nThose Mirror changes are the highlights of Larian’s latest hotfix, but you can read all nitty-gritty details on the Baldur’s Gate 3 Steam page. \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 Hotfix 9 adds name changes and more to the Magic Mirror appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer IronOak Games and publisher Curve Games revealed the sequel will be released worldwide via Steam on November 2 at a price point of $24.99. Pre-orders are live now with a 10% discount as well as some pre-purchase goodies for those who choose to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a small studio of thirteen, we’re so proud of the work we’ve put into For The King II. We’ve worked hard developing new gameplay innovations, features and systems that have built on the successful For The King experience to make it even more enjoyable. We can’t wait for players and friends to party up and start their adventure on November 2nd!\"\n-Sterling Andverson, Studio Directors of Iron Oak Games\n\n\n\nFor the King II builds upon the formula of the successful original. It blends strategic gameplay, JRPG turn-based combat, and roguelite elements that parallel a tabletop adventure. Also, players will now be able to co-op with up to four players as opposed to three.\n\n\nBased on the trailer, it looks like this is just more For the King. Which in my opinion is not a bad thing at all. I have dozens of hours in the original. If you can find a friend or two to play with it's a good time. However, I'll admit, itt can be a bit frustrating at times when bad RNG can cause the end of a run out of nowhere.

I’d say it’s an equally funny thing when you live in ignorance throughout an indie game’s development, only finding out about it when a release trailer is posted. In the case of Knuckle Sandwich, developed by Andy Brophy, I think there will be a fair amount of both column ‘A’ and column ‘B’ when the game drops in November.\n\n\n\n\nIf the game looks or sounds familiar to you, it’s been in development for a while. In fact, we’ve been reporting on it since as early as January 2016 — the flow of time isn’t real and it cannot hurt us. I belong to the camp of folks who are only finding out about this indie darling now, so when I say I am excited to learn that Knuckle Sandwich is set for release on November 23 — I mean it. \n\n\nIn the short release date trailer, we’re welcomed by a nameless, faceless entity who says “I know it’s been a while, but I think we’re ready,” and “It’s time for one last trip to Bright City” before a wormhole opens and consumes small video clips of the game, replacing them with the Knuckle Sandwich logo.\n\n\nIf you’re anything like me and are actively learning about this game now that there’s a release date, its page on Steam says Knuckle Sandwich is a turn-based RPG where battles are conducted via minigames such as “rhythm games, shoot-em-ups, memory puzzles, and quick-time events.”\n\n\nIt follows “a young man through his first day in Bright City – a bustling island paradise with a horrible secret. Find a new job, make new friends, and attempt to solve a mystery revolving around a ludicrous gang and a fanatical cult.” I don’t know about you, but they had me at ‘rhythm games.’\n\nThe post Indie RPG Knuckle Sandwich finally has a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Console ports are expected to follow soon after.\n\n\nThere’s way too much coming out in October. Laika: Aged Through Blood is described as Excitebike meets Metroid, as you explore a non-linear sidescroller world with a dirtbike betwixt your legs and a gun in your hand. I previewed it back in June and really enjoyed what I had played. I would love to review it, but it seems that every small and indie developer on the planet has chosen October to release their game. Maybe I can circle back for a console review when the ports follow.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have the time to try it, I suggest you do. It’s a nice mix of whimsical and brutal, featuring a tonne of violence and death. You play as a badass mom who is out for vengeance when birds decide to attack her village. Be warned, though. Aiming a gun and driving a dirtbike takes a pretty heavy amount of concentration. In my preview, I was concerned that having to stay focused for such a long period of time might become really uncomfortable and difficult.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the art style is terrific, the soundtrack by Beicoli is my new jam, and the premise is incredibly unique. Maybe check out the demo of Laika: Aged Through Blood and see if you dig it.\n\n\nLaika: Aged Through Blood releases on PC October 19, 2023.

          "description": "Atari has revealed that they're bringing Save Mary to their Atari XP cartridge line. This one is a bit more special because it was an unreleased title by Tod Frye, who would go on to program the N64 cult classic Battletanx. He uh… also programmed the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man, which is attributed as a major contributor to the 1983 crash of the video game market.\n\n\nIt’s honestly a pretty fantastic Atari 2600 title. Or, at least, I like it. Your goal is to use a crane to drop bricks on a platform that is slowly being submerged in water. Mary is stuck on this platform and is relying on you to stack these bricks so she can escape. Also, don’t drop them on her because she’ll die a lot quicker from that than she would from drowning.\n\n\nImage via Atari\n\n\nSave Mary was apparently in development for a very long time and eventually canceled when Atari discontinued the 2600 in 1990. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell was quoted in Atarian saying that he was eagerly anticipating the title. Years later, eight of the prototype cartridges were unearthed and dumped onto the internet. Homebrew cartridges would later be sold using the prototype ROM. However, this will be the first time it has been officially released\n\n\nThe Limited Edition version is available for pre-order right now and is only having a 500-cartridge production run. It comes in a box based on the silver box format of 2600 packaging. It also comes with a manual. Neither the site nor the press release states if there will be a standard edition of Save Mary.\n\n\nSave Mary Limited Edition is up for pre-order right now. It’s estimated to ship 3 to 4 months from now.\n\nThe post Atari unearths Save Mary and slaps it on a 2600 cartridge appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is true of Payday 3, which saw matchmaking errors and a lack of offline features resulting in less-than-favorable scores for the game. Fortunately, developer Starbreeze is on the case, though its next update will take a bit longer than expected.\n\n\nOriginally intending to start rolling out this week, a Twitter post from the studio says the team is having to delay the sorely needed Payday 3 patch. The reason cited is the update \"needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again.\" That, and the team wants to \"ensure its stability.\" \n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we now have no release date for it, but the post goes on to say the developer should be able to send it out mid-October.\n\n\nTuning the heist\n\n\nStarbreeze did apologize for having to delay the update, with a second post underneath saying that the PS5 bonus content \"will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready.\"\n\n\nOn the plus side, there's going to be some additional server maintenance, so soon after the ones that occurred last weekend. An additional tweet from the official Payday 3 account says this maintenance will be going ahead between \"8am-11am CEST on the 6th and 10th of October,\" and will hopefully \"not be noticeable.\"\n\n\nWhile it's very easy to blame the studios themselves when games are released in poor states, there are always greater factors to consider. From what Starbreeze has said, it sounds like the team is scrambling to get things sorted. It's a shame we're having to wait a bit longer for the update, but hopefully it just means a more substantial and stable patch.\n\nThe post Payday 3 update delayed, studio issues apology appeared first on Destructoid.",

Recently, developer Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone returned to give us another tease as to what we might be getting in the hit farming simulator.\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter, the creative mind behind Stardew Valley has suggested that the game is going to be getting cats and dogs...wearing hats.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, many commenting under the post are positively giddy with cuteness overload, with one user referring to it as \"the greatest moment in gaming history.\" While we don't yet know whether these headgear-dawning animals will appear in the next update, it's possible we could see them in version 1.6.\n\n\nONE'S EVEN WEARING A BOW!\n\n\nThe Twitter post has even prompted a reply from Whitney \"Cenx\" Spinks, the producer behind Re-Logic's Terraria. The message asks Barone to confide in a private message about the next patch's release date. In return, Cenx says they'll spill the beans on the release date for 1.4.5 of Terraria.\n\n\nWho knows whether such an exchange will take place. In any case, a lot of people seem excited about the possibility of seeing a fedora-wearing canine walking about in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nBarone has said that update 1.6 will only  be releasing once they deem it ready (which is novel for this modern gaming industry). Whenever it does roll out, look forward to a new festival, more dialogue, winter outfits for villagers, new secrets, and more.\n\nThe post Cats in hats could be coming to Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It has not been a good run for Redfall, the vampire FPS from the Austin branch of Arkane Studios, and Bethesda doesn't appear to be giving up on it. Having said that, so few people are playing the game that it's tough to imagine how it will ever recover.\n\n\nAs spotted by PCGamesN, the number of players logged into Redfall has dropped so much, that it's down to double digits. In fact, at the time of writing, only six people were playing according to SteamDB, so we're now into single figures.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe numbers are going down all the time, and the game's Steam page currently shows it has a \"Mostly Negative\" review score, with little hope of that changing any time soon.\n\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\n\nLike a lot of AAA releases these days, Redfall was plagued with bugs from the moment it was released. Things don't seem to have gotten much better since then. Microsoft's own Phil Spencer was said to be disappointed with the reception.\n\n\nBut it wasn't just a case of it feeling incomplete in terms of polish. To many, the game itself felt empty, devoid of life, and even repetitive. Considering this has the Arkane stamp on it, the same studio that brought us Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop (though that one did have its detractors), many were hoping for so much more.\n\n\nRedfall seems to have done the genre a great disservice. If these recent player count numbers are anything to go by, it's likely the game will be quickly forgotten in the annals of time.\n\nThe post Redfall’s player count is so bad, it’s apparently registering single figures appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "KarmaZoo, a cooperative platformer party game developed by Pastagames and published by Devolver Digital has set a release date for November 14. In this unorthodox multiplayer experience, players seem to be encouraged to diminish the ego and prioritize their friends — or, in some cases, perfect strangers.\n\n\n\n\nIn the release date announcement trailer, it looks like this game is predominantly speed-based in the sense that players will be put into a course where they must make it to the finish line. But unlike most games of this archetype, KarmaZoo encourages selfless actions that benefit the collective over the self. \n\n\nFor example, one scenario might be a large ravine that is impossible to cross, with spikes at the bottom. If you were to jump into the ravine, your demise would trigger a tombstone to fall, providing your fellow players a stepping stone to cross it. In exchange for your noble sacrifice, you’d earn extra rewards at the end of the round. But, it’s not all about self-sacrifice — any positive action that benefits the team can be recognized and rewarded. So, it’s not a competition. It’s more a collaboration than anything else.\n\n\nI say all that, but for those readers who’re itching to beat their friends in Karma-based minigames, there will be a competitive mode added to the final release. So, no matter if you’re feeling like working with a group of friends (or strangers), or if you want some brutal competition, KarmaZoo has you covered.\n\n\nBased on the trailer, the game adopts this nostalgic, pixel-based art style that reminds me of indie games such as VVVVVV. I do worry that, thanks to the incredibly small sprite size for these characters, it’ll be a difficult one for those of us with poor eyesight. But, it might not be as big a deal in the game itself.\n\n\nKarmaZoo is set for release on November 14, and will be available for the Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. \n\nThe post Co-op party platformer KarmaZoo launches on November 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's also a Japanese TV series on the way, but don't expect to see more CG-animated Pokémon waltzing about in this one. Per Crunchyroll news, Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde — Pack Your Pockets with Adventure, or PokéTsume for short —is a Pokemon-inspired drama that aims to mine a very specific type of nostalgia. In particular, nostalgia aimed at folks who grew up on the original Game Boy and the first Pokemon games. \n\n\nMadoka Akagi is one such person, and she's about to rediscover the adventures she loved as a child. She's currently moving to Tokyo to pursue her ambitions as a creator, and receives something very special during the move. Her family gives her a Game Boy Pocket and Pokemon Red as a parting gift. Since she grew up playing Pokemon, she's immediately ready to dive back into its world. You can hear those familiar sounds and watch as her work life intermingles with her rekindled love for 'Mon in the first trailer for the drama. \n\n\n\n\nOnce a game freak\n\n\nThe actor in the role of Madoka is Nanase Nishino. She's played roles like Hiromi in Shin Kamen Rider, but she has an even better qualification for PokéTsume. She's a Pokémon fan in real life, so playing someone like Madoka should come naturally. \n\n\nPokéTsume was created as a collaboration between Pokémon Inc. and TV Tokyo. Its premiere is right around the corner as part of the network's MokuDora24 slot on October 19. \n\n\nBeyond this, there's also that live-action Pokemon series in the works at Netflix and a Detective Pikachu sequel. It's been a while since we heard anything about either, so maybe we're better off firing up our Game Boys like Madoka in the meantime. \n\nThe post Live-action Pokémon drama PokéTsume mines Game Boy nostalgia in its debut trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Blizzard hosted the first of their two Devstreams regarding the upcoming Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of the Blood, yesterday. And, I have to say...it was actually pretty good. In the trove of quality-of-life changes and enhancements coming to the ARPG, a buff to the drop rate of Uber Uniques was mentioned. Diablo Designer Joe Shely followed up on Twitter afterward confirming the buffed drop rate.\n\n\n\n\nPromising changes coming to Season of Blood\n\n\nIn the slide, Shely references, it mentions that players will have \"Greater access to Uber Uniques via Uber Duriel\". Duriel is the final of the five new bosses coming in Season 2. Players will need to farm materials from earlier bosses in order to spawn him. In the tweet, Shely states that Uber Uniques will still be rare. But players who farm Uber Duriel are going to see them eventually. In its current form, there's no way to farm Uber Uniques and even players who spend hundreds of hours farming a season aren't likely to see them drop.\n\n\nThis is an immensely positive change for Diablo 4, and makes me hopeful about future development. The ability to actually target farm Uber Uniques, even if they still have a rare drop, at least gives players a goal. Blizzard has a history of refusing to change their philosophy on certain mechanics like drop rates. But the decision to make a big change like this is a big improvement over previous Blizzard titles.\n\n\nI'm still reserving my overall judgment for the fate of Season 2 because that will depend a lot on the new content of the season. But a lot of the changes that were announced simply make the game better. Blizzard plans to support Diablo 4 for years, so we're still very early on its lifecycle. If it plans to stand with other long-lasting ARPG's like Diablo 2: Resurrected, Diablo 3, and Path of Exile, updates like this are a big part of it.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, launches on October 17 on all platforms.\n\nThe post Uber Uniques getting a buff to drop rate in Diablo 4 Season 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

CD Projekt Red announced this today along with some interesting statistics regarding the IP and the studio's other games. \n\n\n\n\nAn image reveals what platforms players are enjoying the game's latest DLC, Phantom Liberty, on. The majority of Phantom Liberty's units have been sold on PC. Of the 86% on the platform, 10% are playing on GOG.com. There are 13% on Xbox Series X/S, and the remaining 20% are on PS5. These are all excellent numbers for CD Projekt Red, especially when one remembers the rocky launch the game had which eventually led to it being pulled off the PS Store. \n\n\nSome of the stats reveal what a mammoth task it was to resurrect the game. Phantom Liberty required 275 million PLN (almost $63 million) for direct production expenditure and 95 million PLN in marketing costs (almost $22 million). It took 360 developers from CD Projekt Red, and there were 3,600 people engaged in the project. \n\n\nLooking more widely, the studio also reveals that it has sold 100 million copies across its franchises, including The Witcher. This puts the studio in a good position as it prepares to expand its franchises with a new The Witcher game. \n\n\nCD Projekt Red's continued investment into Cyberpunk has clearly paid off, and although the studio has stated that Phantom Liberty is the last major DLC, it is not done with the IP just yet. It has also been announced that a live-action project is in the works in collaboration with Anonymous Content.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 has sold 25 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Pale Reach will have sailors exploring a frozen a new “icy expanse.”\n\n\nThe Pale Reach adds a new arctic biome. You’re tasked with following in the footsteps of a doomed expedition. I’ve read At the Mountain of Madness. I know exactly how this is going to turn out. In this new region is 11 new species of aquatic life, as well as their twisted aberrant alternatives.\n\n\nThat’s all I got. It’s more Dredge. Here’s the trailer:\n\n\n\n\nI reviewed Dredge when it launched back in March. I wasn’t too impressed. I summed it up by saying, “It’s hardly condemning to say, ‘this fishing game is about fishing.’ I’m mostly trying to stress that, ‘No, this is really about fishing.’” Because, like, it looks like a horror game – and it is – but it’s less unraveling a mystery and more selling the catch of the day. I felt that the fishing got a bit repetitive over time, and everything around it was a bit shallow.\n\n\nI'm not really certain if The Pale Reach expansion is going to do anything to fix that, but a lot of people enjoyed Dredge for what it was, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\nThe Pale Reach is coming to Dredge on November 16, 2023.

          "description": "CD Projekt Red, the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, has announced the studio will be partnering with Anonymous Content to produce a live-action “project” set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Anonymous Content is most known for producing works such as True Detective and Mr. Robot, but its catalog is overflowing with series such as Saint X, Shantaram, and The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.\n\n\nIt is currently unknown what form this live-action Cyberpunk story would take, but considering CD Projekt Red is working closely with Anonymous Content Studios’ head of television Garret Kemble, director of development Ryan Schwartz, and CCO David Levine, it would make sense to be a series, rather than a film on the big screen.\n\n\nWhat we do know is that this will be a brand new story in the Cyberpunk universe, not an adaptation. The announcement by CD Projekt Red says “the new project is at an early development stage and has currently commenced searching for a screenwriter to tell a brand-new story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.” While Kemble, Schwartz, Levine, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully will be producing, “the project will be developed in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.”\n\n\nIf this series or film or whatever this project manifests as can be as well made as the anime adaptation, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, it could be an exceptional experience. Because it’s a new story and not a direct adaptation, the project already sounds like a winner. Though it’d be nice if they were able to offer Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba a spot on the cast, even if they’re just walk-on cameos. \n\nThe post A live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project is in development appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Upcoming gothic-themed title The Last Faith will release worldwide on November 15. The dark and visceral Metroidvania and Soulslike hybrid from developer Kumi Souls focuses on methodical combat in a dark yet beautiful 2D world. As has become standard in the genre, The Last Faith will feature intense boss fights that are challenging yet rewarding. Of course you can draw parallels to games like Dark Souls. But, with the 2D art style, it actually reminds me a lot of Salt and Sanctuary or Blasphemous 2.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Mythringal\n\n\nWow, what a trailer. It looks like it will be a pretty intense venture through the city of Mythringal. As seen in the trailer, The Last Faith gives players access to an arsenal of melee weapons, spells, and even firearms. The bosses look diverse and intricate in their attack patterns. It's par for the course for these kind of games, but I already know I'll be getting frustrated during some of these fights. In a good way, of course.\n\n\nThose wanting to check out The Last Faith beforehand can access an extended demo that is available now on Steam. In the demo, players can experience early parts of The Last Faith.\n\n\nThe last Faith releases digitally worldwide on November 15 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe post Metroidvania and Soulslike hybrid The Last Faith releases November 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A PC version is in the works for a later date.\n\n\nA Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia was released on the NES in 1990, and it’s an odd one for the time period. In a lot of ways, it feels more like an early home computer game than a late NES title. It’s very freeform, and the world itself is like a very big puzzle. It takes a while to acclimate to it, and then you’ll likely need a few attempts at the game to finally see the end. It’s not impossible. It’s just a little overwhelming and unforgiving.\n\n\nThe collection also includes The Rescue of Blobette (also known as David Crane’s The Rescue of Blobette Starring a Boy and His Blob) is very similar but with smaller flipscreens and fewer colors.\n\n\n\n\nBoth games were developed by the legendary David Crane, who is best known for his work in Pitfall. The two games have their charm, but I don’t think they’re the best from the developer. Nonetheless, they’re unique, which counts for something.\n\n\nBoth games have been converted to Limited Run Games’ proprietary Carbon Engine. The Collection was available physically on PS4, PS5, and Switch, as well as separately as NES and GameBoy reissues, but those sold out. If you missed them, here’s your chance to get them digitally.\n\n\nA Boy and His Blob Retro Collection releases digitally on Switch, PS4, and PS5 on October 17, 2023. Release for the PC version is unannounced.\n\nThe post A Boy and His Blob Retro Collection brings back the jellybeans October 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has revealed that another one of its franchises will be getting a Lego theme. This time around it's Animal Crossing, and we've gotten a sneak peek that's criminally cute. It appears that the set will feature at least eight figurines, and all the fan favorites are there including Rosie, Bunnie, Marshal, Kappa, Fauna, Julian, Isabella, and Tom Nook.\n\n\n\n\nThere's been no release date or prices yet, and we haven't gotten a look at what sets will be coming our way. However, Lego leaker @Falconbricks, who had made a post predicting an Animal Crossing Lego theme in August, also claims that 5 sets will be released in March 2024. \n\n\nAs of June 2023, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has sold over 42 million copies, so there's no shortage of fans to ensure these fly off shelves. This isn't the only reason Animal Crossing fans can get excited, as this month brings New Horizons' Halloween event that is held every year. \n\n\nIs Animal Crossing not your thing? There have been plenty of Lego Super Mario sets released since 2020, including the Larry's and Morton’s Airships Expansion Set which hit stores this year. \n\nThe post Lego Animal Crossing is too adorable appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nSet in icy waters, the DLC will include \"1-3 hours of content\" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. \nFor more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show.

From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.",

Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. \nThe original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, \"bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.\" \nCheck out Berzerk: Recharged for yourself in the announcement trailer below: \n\n\n\"Though he sports an ominous grin…",

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.\nThe tweet accompanying the teaser says, \"Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!\" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. \nCheck out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below: \nWelcome to…LEGO Animal Crossing!#AnimalCrossing #LEGO #Nintendo pic.twitter.com/un3R7QwlRC\nOctober 5, 2023\nThis Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos.

It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. \nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston.

After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late.

They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. \nFor the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is \"a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring.\" \nYou can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players \"will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.\" \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the \"Little Man\" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.\nThe Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam.

          "description": "Last week ended with a dire flood of layoffs in the games industry, including Sega, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and Epic games. Unfortunately, this week seems to be following the trend – Team17, developer of the Worms series, and publisher of games like Blasphemous, Dredge, and more, has announced layoffs as well, according to Eurogamer.\nThe job losses, which are due to a \"company restructure,\" will eliminate about 50 positions from the company, and the majority of those positions will be in the publisher's QA department. Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.\nIn addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.\nFor more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.\n[Source: Eurogamer, VG247]\nWhat do you think about this year's massive amount of layoffs?",

It's a game that's been on my radar since earlier this year: both because I love most anything related to pirates and because, well, Bilkins' Folly looks great. Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!\nI spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email. We discussed the game's inspiration, the challenges of the adventure genre, the game's gibberish language, how the idea of it came from a missing wedding ring, and much more. \nYou can read our full interview below…",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
