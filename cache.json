You wear clothes that expose your unchristian knees and you eat a lot of ice cream, for which you should self-flagellate, and so on. Fittingly, sequel to unabashedly Catholic-y Metroidvania Blasphemous is out on August 24th, as revealed in a trailer at tonight's Summer Game Fest. Blasphemous 2, which was only revealed back in April, looks to be similar to the fist game, i.e. it's a side-scrolling Soulslike drenched in the most bloody and grim Christian imagery you can think of.

And that's thanks to the folks over at Double Fine Productions, iam8bit, and PlayStation's indie champion Greg Rice who put all of this together for us to enjoy each year.

I got to see a sneak peak of it back in March at GDC, but I've been sworn to secrecy ever since. But at long last, Saltsea Chronicles has made its debut at tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, and I can finally unburden myself and let out 90 days' worth of fizz pop excitement for this gorgeous new adventure game. \nSet on a flooded, post-apocalyptic Earth, creative director Hannah Nicklin described it to me like this: \"What if you were watching Star Trek, but you get to choose where they go, who's on the adventure and what they get to say?\" It's a tantalising premise, especially when it's all packaged up in the same crisp, pastel colour palette as the perpetually stunning Mutazione. The Star Trek reference isn't just for show, either. You might only be visiting different islands rather than whole planets during the course of Saltsea Chronicles, but it does have a natty, Alexander Courage-grade theme tune that plays between its chapters. The most exciting thing about this oceanic trek, however, is its incredibly cool save system that lets you dip in and out of different story branches to explore different paths and opportunities as you see fit. Let me tell you all about it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Seems like there'll be plenty more bloodthirsty creatures and god-like monsters to get a'brawling with in Remnant 2 - that's the case from the looks of the new trailer revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest, at least. We've already seen a teaser of Gearbox Publishing's upcoming action-survival sequel, but this one seriously pulls out all the stops.

          "description": "Some time back I made fun of the preview for Immortals Of Aveum because a) it was quite a silly hands-off preview and b) Immortals Of Aveum is very clearly a game that needs to be played to properly get to grips with it. It's out on July 20th, so not too far away. Have I played it yet? No! Of course not! But we're getting closer to a hands on, and after a six-minute video of the magic FPS in action last month, tonight's Summer Game Fest threw us a big, bombastic boss fight on top of a steampunk Jaeger, or something. I dunno, it was hard to tell over the light show. Those sure are a lot of magical fireworks going off. I like it. Jangle some more keys in front of me, games man.\n\nThe video itself is, uh, well, it's not long, and it's quite choppy. While I enjoy a good setpiece, my concerns remain the same as before, i.e. the magic shooting, despite the different flavours of magic broadly corresponding to a different kind of gun, looks pretty weightless, and the enemies look bullet spongey. I do like the colours and the traversal, though.\n Read more",

Lake told us a little bit more about said agent Saga Anderson, leading into a first glimpse of \"raw gameplay\" (as opposed to cooked?) that showed her in action. I have to say, my first impression is that Saga is a terrible FBI agent who is going to ruin the chain of evidence if this ever goes to court because this woman will not put on gloves to handle a goddamn thing.\nRead more",

She seems like the kind of gal who would eat a bunch of babies and puppies as a snack, and I love that for her.

Things will happen to characters during the story, you say? No kidding! \nBut thanks to some clever internet sleuthing, eager Final Fantasy fans are quickly realising that there's a lot more to these comments than meets the eye. Well, at least there is in the original Japanese versions of them. The English translation team clearly didn't get the same memo... \nRead more",

I mean, I assume you can, they’re one of ten characters you’re able to romantically pursue in the delicious depths of this Eldritch dating sim. But in actuality, I simply don't know, because after ten-plus hours and multiple playthroughs, that all-important question remains unanswered. It’s not something unique to my dashing, tentacled suitor, either. Many of my romantic pursuits in the Neath totally fizzled out. It's giving Berocca when I wanted Coke and Mentos.\nMask Of The Rose is Failbetter’s visual novel dating sim set in the Fallen London universe, an already established alt-history Victorian London that the studio has been building over a decade as a quite excellent browser game. In this alternative history,  London has been dragged through the Earth’s crust by bats and now resides in a vast underground cavern called the Neath. With the economy literally in the pits and Queen Vicky refusing to leave her cushy palace, London has become somewhat unruly, turning into a lasciviously gothic underworld home to a whole parade of monsters, devils, living statues, cloaked beings with red eyes... basically the entire cast of the Goosebumps books.\nRead more",

Largely because this was my first experience of it with gamepad controls, and using thumbsticks and face buttons to move and toss out spells just feels more... I don't know, direct? Like I’m actually controlling my Necromancer and her boney bodyguards, not just clicking a unit and watching their animations.\nIt helps that Diablo IV’s Steam Deck performance is surprisingly spry, with fast 45-60fps framerates within reach even when leaving the majority of graphics settings on Ultra quality. Unlike all of the other best Steam Deck games, there’s no native support for its Battle.net launcher, but with some resourcefulness, that needs only be a temporary barrier.\nRead more",

          "description": "Some games adapt to VR more naturally than others. Games that take place primarily in a cockpit, like Elite Dangerous or Euro Truck Simulator 2, need relatively little adjustment to make them enjoyable in VR. They don't require the player to move around much, and their whole shtick about providing an authentic, immersive experience. \r\n\n\r\nGames that require a lot of fast movement, or require the player to keep track of a lot of different objects, are generally harder to make work through VR Goggles. Hence why Amid Evil VR caught my attention. Shooters are common VR fodder, but they're typically built as VR experiences from the ground up. Amid Evil, on the other hand, is a flatscreen retro shooter designed to be reactive, surreal, and above all, fast. It's a game where you zip around arcane dimensions like a magic missile, splattering weird little armoured guys with enchanted swords and a staff that fires planets. It's a brilliant game, one of the best old-skool shooters to emerge from the genre's revival. But on paper, it's about as VR friendly as Morpheus.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Tickets are on sale now, and RPS supporters can also get a special code to nab themselves a free drink. Details below.   \nRead more",

          "description": "With the arrival of Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics cards in gaming laptops, models with previous-gen RTX 30-series cards are becoming super-affordable. Now you can get even high-models for less than £1000, including this HP Omen machine which includes a 16.1-inch 1440p 165Hz display, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and Ryzen 7 6800H CPU for £972 on Amazon. \nThe same machine retailed for £1629 in March this year, so this is a huge bargain - especially given that this is still hugely a powerful machine for 1440p gaming. The spec even includes a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so it's a convincing machine from top to bottom. \nRead more",

Like your bus arriving on time, a minute after watching the previous, late-arriving one flip onto its roof attempting a handbrake turn.  \nIt’s not perfect, but Diablo IV does run smoothly for the most part (also sorry Google, but I'm going back to Roman numberals), and its system requirements on PC are as likely to involve museum pieces as they are the latest and priciest graphics cards. I’ve put some hours into the early access build and have come up with a best settings guide, but in truth, this will likely just optimise your framerates – Diablo IV’s higher quality settings rarely trouble it, especially at 1080p.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm unsure whether to call Raid On Taihoku a \"historical game\", since it's an adventure game with enough daftness to feel a bit unlike what that phrase brings to mind. But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.\nTaxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.\nRead more",

          "description": "Take one good look at the upcoming Catch & Cook: Fishing Adventure and you might just mistake it for 2023’s other third-person cartoony fishing sim: Dredge. The big-toothed mutants and otherworldly horrors in Dredge can get quite overwhelming though, especially when they start to chomp at your ship beneath the surface. After playing Catch & Cook’s recently released demo, I’m happy to report that it’s the ideal fishing sim for people who find Dredge’s spooky undercurrents, erm, too spooky. Just a very chill, very good time. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "David Brevik, now the president of Skystone Games, did not expect to encounter a doppelganger when he arrived at Chicago’s Consumer Electronic Show in the summer of 1994. He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.\r\n\n\r\nWithout their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It looks to be a remaster in the strictest sense, as those shots certainly smell of the Unreal 3 Engine.\nhttps://youtu.be/xMnx6H91pqg\nBeyond that, there isn’t much to see, but more is promised for June 14 at 21:00 PST.\nI’m curious to see if Suda51 and Shinji Mikami will be doing anything in terms of “director’s cut” content. Its development was reportedly wrought with corporate interference from EA. But then, I’m not sure if EA is even going to be involved here.\nI suppose a straight port to new hardware would be something worthwhile. I wasn’t a huge fan of Shadows of the Damned, even as a fan of Suda51. However, I would probably give it another chance with a remastered version. So, bring it on.\nWe’ll find out more about it on Wednesday, but for now, we just know that the Shadows of the Damned Remastered is “coming soon.”\nThe post Shadows of the Damned Remastered coming from Grasshopper Manufacture appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Someone is in trouble\nNot only was a Persona 3 remake entitled Persona 3 Reload leaked on Atlus' Instagram, but also a strategy title called Persona 5 Tactica.\nhttps://twitter.com/junoharuto/status/1666934463199059978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1666934463199059978%7Ctwgr%5E1484ee3139010faa9330d607bdb86b9281ddc96c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F06%2Fpersona-5-tactica-launches-17th-november-persona-3-reload-early-2024\nAs the name implies, Persona 5 Tactica takes the cast of the fifth Persona to the world of tactical RPGs. The trailer makes it sound as though the gang has been transported to another world. A world of tactics, I'm guessing.\nThe title briefly popped up on Atlus' Instagram page, and the trailer for it was quickly seized and disseminated across the vast expanses of the internet. This occurred simultaneously with Persona 3 Reload which we covered in a previous post. There's no jamming this sleeping bag back in its sack.\nWhile Persona 3 Reload has a much more vague release date, Persona 5 Tactica is slated for November 17, 2023. Currently, only Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC have been announced. However, keep in mind that this looks to have been meant for a Microsoft stream, and they don't typically advertise when a game is also going to be on other platforms.\nThe post Double whoops!

Some have speculated that it was partially the reason that we got Persona 3 Portable remastered for modern consoles instead of Persona 3 FES. There were even further leaks later on, but their credibility was somewhat in question. Not totally unbelievable, but not proof positive.\nHowever, it looks like someone on Atlus' Instagram account hit post instead of schedule, and the cat got out of the bag. Not only is Persona 3 Reload on the docket, but there is also another spin-off title headed our way called Persona 5 Tactica.\nPersona 3 Reload looks to be a top-to-bottom remake of the classic PS2 title. Currently, it's slated for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in early 2024. Since this looks like it was going to be part of a Microsoft stream, I wouldn't take that as the gospel. They just wouldn't advertise it being on anyone else's platform.\nThe post Whoops! Persona 3 Reload announcement was leaked appeared first on Destructoid.",

It starts off showing the aftermath of the first game before showing off the world you'll be exploring. There are a number of re-imagined scenes that will be familiar to anyone who played the original title, as well as some new surprises. There's an especially big twist that I don't want to spoil in case you don't want to watch the trailer and prefer to go in blind. I respect that.\nPerhaps the most exciting information here is that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is slated for early 2024. But most excitingly is that it's coming on two discs. In this economy? I can't remember the last time I saw a game come on two discs without it actually being two separate titles.

          "description": "Insane Clown Poopy\nWe now have our first in-episode footage of Peacock's upcoming live-action adaptation, Twisted Metal. As debuted during this afternoon's Summer Game Fest, the clip featured our ragtag protagonist (Anthony Mackie) squaring off against serial killer clown and poster villain Sweet Tooth (Samoa Joe).\nAnd honestly... it was pretty fucking rough.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mn4RBWv03A\nFor some reason, the decision was made to showcase a clip from the show that doesn't actually feature any cars whatsoever. It does, however, feature some daylight-bad punches, sub-MCU comedy, and Sisqo's 1999 hit, The Thong Song. I'm a big Twisted Metal fan, and I absolutely do not mind when other media plays with, rearranges, or even reinvents popular worlds and characters in new and exciting ways.\nBut this clip was... not good. It wasn't funny, it looked kinda cheap, the displaced Sweet Tooth voice is distracting, and the sense of humor seemed tonally lost both within its own universe and on the silent, slow-clapping Summer Game Fest audience.\nBeing generous, we'll put this down to a bad choice of clip and see how it all goes down on July 27, when Twisted Metal premieres exclusively on Peacock...\n...Imagine the producers: \"One rule for the Twisted Metal show reveal.

In this case, it's Lysfanga from Sand Door Studio, which brings its own twist to the formula.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDRfAVyW0aw\nWhat will hopefully separate Lysfanga from the competition is a time traveling mechanic. By rewinding time, Lysfangha's protagonist will create specters of her past self that fight alongside her. While we've seen similar mechanics in other games, it's still a neat concept to see pop up across different genres.\nWhile a release date was not nailed down, we did get a reveal that the title would arrive later this year on PC via Steam and Epic Games.\nThe post Indie time traveling ARPG Lysfanga coming in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

But for Marvel's Spider Man 2, it needs no such fanfare. They simply had game director Bryan Intihar come on stage, talk about a few details, and then the bombshell drops. Marvel's Spider Man 2 launches on October 20, 2023. The crowd goes wild.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI9ym7wYf28\nWhile a simple release date could stand on its own as a major reveal, we also gleaned some juicy new details about the upcoming PS5 exclusive. For example, Venom is \"not Eddie Brock,\" as Intihar asserts that the team wanted to tell an original story with this title. Additionally, we also received news that the city \"pretty much doubled in size.\" Pretty exciting!\nFollowing the show, a post on the PlayStation blog confirms that pre-orders for the game will open on June 16. As has become common for major game releases, we have a few editions of the game to choose from. There's of course the standalone game for $69.99. For $79.99, we also have the Digital Deluxe edition, which comes with \"2 additional skill points\" and a handful of cosmetics.\n[caption id=\"attachment_385338\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Insomniac Games[/caption]\nThat said, hardcore fans can sling for the $229.99 Collector's Edition, which contains a Steelbook case and a 19 inch statue of Venom fending off the Spider Men. Only a digital voucher for the game in this one though, which tickles my funny bone.\nIt's a tough act to follow a huge critical hit like the original Marvel's Spider Man, but it seems the team at Insomniac Games wants to surpass all expectations.

While en masse zombie shooters are not exactly few and far between, Toxic Commando is being produced by director (and passionate video game fan) John Carpenter, who is behind such movies as Halloween, The Thing, and Prince of Darkness.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqY8YoOkmIo\nIt will be interesting to see how Carpenter's influence instills itself in the final product, and hopefully helps Toxic Commando to break away from the typical first-person chaos of the many previous co-op zombie shooters that have come before. We still have a while to wait, as Toxic Commando will not be with us until some point in 2024, but given its Gen9 exclusivity and pedigree producer, it's an exciting prospect, guaranteeing a somewhat splatteriffic release.\nToxic Commando launches next year on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Toxic Commando is a new zombie masher produced by John Carpenter appeared first on Destructoid.",

They have also revealed that it will be free to try out as part of Steam Next Fest.\nThe trailer sure is a lot. A guy gets clobbered and dies. Then he’s revived. Then things get all explodey, and a bunch of dudes get knocked around. Oh, man. It sure looks like a thing.\nhttps://youtu.be/hiJjooA4Vlc\nI had to actually turn to its now-live Steam page to really figure out what I was supposed to be seeing. Warhaven touts 36-player battles and gives emphasis to its tactical side. It looks like a MOBA, and sure enough, in the steam tags, it says MOBA. Its art style reminds me of a less grim Souls game.\nWarhaven will be free-to-play, and you’ll have a chance to try it out as part of Steam Next Fest (coming next week). The full release is planned for Fall.\nThe post Warhaven will be playable as part of Steam Next Fest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alan Wake 2 looks fantastic so far, but at the very least, we got an actual look at gameplay today. On stage, Keighty reminds Lake that the game was teased at The Game Awards in 2021 for a \"2023\" release. Well, it's 2023, and it already has a date: now we know what it actually looks like.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOr5gh2Kkqw\nThis is \"early on\" in the game, Lake confirms (in case you were worried about spoilers!), and Keighley calls it \"raw unedited\" footage. Saga (who has a pistol with a capacity of 12 rounds in the trailer sequence) is the core focus, as they walk up and enter an extremely creepy house, fighting off enemies in the process. There will be a \"50/50 split\" between the two main characters (Alan Wake and Saga Anderson), Lake says, and you can swap between them at \"given points\" in the story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hm0AmdB9AM\nAlan Wake 2 is still due out on October 17, 2023 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.\nThe post Alan Wake 2 footage debuts at Summer Game Fest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since we covered the multimedia adaptation of Akira Toriyama's cult hit manga Sand Land late last year, Geoff Keighley's show's reveal of the game wasn't totally news. However, we did receive confirmation that this upcoming action RPG would launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-h48hdeoEM\nThe footage we did see showed a lot of creatures, vehicles, and creatures in vehicles. A blog post by Bandai Namco Europe confirms that the Sand Land game comes to us via ILCA, who recently gave us One Piece Odyssey and Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Sand Land will focus on vehicular and character combat, which I imagine makes sense for readers of the manga.\nI never as much as saw the source material for Sand Land until I conducted research for this article. However, since the game coincides with a \"visual adaptation,\" it looks like Bandai Namco hopes to broaden the work's appeal. Will it work? Who knows! Even with this reveal, details remain scarce about the project.\nKeighley noted \"we're excited to see more of it soon\" following the trailer. In other words, we'll hopefully learn more details about Project Sand Land soon.\nThe post Project Sand Land is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Instead of just asking players to buy Diablo IV, she's asking them to die — in the game.\nShe begins the video by saying \"If there's one thing I love, it's the sight of blood. And in Diablo IV, there are rivers of it\". This alludes to Blizzard's new campaign where Fox herself will be eulogizing the deaths of some players who use the hashtag #DiabloDeaths. The idea might sound cool, but remember that she also states that it might not be a good eulogy. It's Megan and Blizzard who will ultimately decide whether players died as heroes — or total chumps.

          "description": "The magnetism of a giant lady in a big ol' hat\nTwo years on from its initial release, (yep, two years), Capcom's gothic-horror title Resident Evil Village is still selling copies and scaring players worldwide — This morning, the publisher announced that the latest, (well, chronologically latest), entry in the survival horror series has surpassed eight million sales.\nResident Evil Village sees returning protagonist Ethan Winters journey into a grim European village, searching for answers following a violent attack on his home and family. There, he will encounter creatures and citizens beyond his darkest nightmare, coming face-to-face with a menagerie of monsters and demons, as well as the four lords of the land — namely Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, Donna Beneviento & Angie, and the iconic Lady Dimitrescu, whose impact on the title's marketing, and therefore sales, cannot be overstated.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKocYiRHYlI\nFollowing the game's initial release in May 2021, an expansion pack, Winters' Expansion, was released in October of last year, which added new features and an additional campaign, Shadows of Rose. While the switch from \"classic\" Resi to the modern, first-person Resi has not been to everybody's taste, it cannot be denied that the evolution of the series has been incredibly impressive, borne out in both the critical and praise heaped upon the titles, as well as the titles' respective sales figures — A VR edition of Resident Evil Village was also developed to launch alongside the PlayStation VR2 hardware.\nResident Evil Village is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (via cloud)\nThe post Resident Evil Village hits 8 million sales milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

A lenghty trailer gave us some good looks at its gameplay, story, as well as a much-anticipated release window. \nThe story sees Cloud and the gang explore beyond Midgar to stop Sephiroth’s plans, and we see looks at the grander Final Fantasy VII story, likely to be laden with new twists. In terms of new faces, get to see Elena join Reno and Rude in the Turks, and Yuffie, the fiery Wutai ninja introduced in the Intermission story expansion, officially joins the party. \n\n\nPerhaps the most surprising revelation is that Rebirth will come on two discs. Given how much storage a single Blu-ray can hold, that suggests that Rebirth could be a mammoth-sized experience, which is wild given that it’s only Part 2 of a planned trilogy of games. We also now know that Rebirth is coming in early 2024 exclusively to PlayStation 5.",

As you might expect, this mainly means he's beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. The trailer shows a variety of large-scale fights, as well as Kiryu's new fighting abilities, which include a rope-type weapon he can use to bring items and people closer to him.\nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nAs pointed out by Gematsu, Gaiden gameplay details actually leaked yesterday on the PlayStation Store. Here are some of the key details:\n\"Dynamically switch between the Yakuza and Agent fighting styles in visceral melee combat.\n\"With the Yakuza style, strike fear into enemies by unleashing wildly aggressive moves powered by Kiryu’s unparalleled strength and flair.\n\"Or up the ante with the Agent style by delivering blows with absolute speed and precision, while using an array of high-tech gadgets like electrified bind wires to stun enemies then send them flying.\n\"Strategically adapt to the situation and leverage both styles to dominate and destroy hordes of enemies.\"\n\"Whether you’re brawling in the secret Castle arena, singing a new karaoke song, enjoying a drink at the live-action cabaret club, or racing in the pocket circuit, the world offers a variety of immersive experiences.\n\"An intriguing informant named Akame also provides thrilling sub-missions, drawing you into an epic showdown that unfolds the more you explore and enjoy Sotenbori, Yokohama and the mysterious Castle.\"\nLike A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released on November 9, 2023.",

          "description": "Sick of losing cubes in Marvel Snap? This newest game mode might be the solution to your problems. Today during Summer Game Fest, Second Dinner's Chief Development Officer Ben Brode took to the stage to announce that Conquest, Marvel Snap's newest mode, will launch on June 13. The news was accompanied by a promotional skit featuring SungWon Cho, who you might recognize as Ratatoskr from God of War: Ragnarök. You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nConquest Mode works similarly to Marvel Snap's Battle Mode. Two players are matched up for a series of games, each with ten units of health. Instead of wagering cubes, the currency players use to gain levels in the standard ranked mode, Conquest will have players wagering health. Unlike Battle Mode, which ends as soon as one player runs out of health, Conquest has players progress through tiers of competition, requiring longer winning streaks the higher they get. As a reward for making it to the top, players will receive exclusive cosmetics.\n“It’s just insane how good players have gotten at Marvel Snap since we launched in the fall,\" Brode said in a press release. \"For our most competitive, high-skilled players, we wanted to give them the ultimate challenge with Conquest. Players can now find out who truly is the best of the best and worthy of ultimate Marvel Snap glory!! What’s also super cool about Conquest is that the Proving Grounds can double as a great way to try out new decks, as Conquest has no impact on a player's Marvel Snap season rank.\"\nMarvel Snap recently started its \"Spider-Versus\" season, which will introduce new cards such as Ghost-Spider, Spider-Ham, and Silk. The game is currently available on PC and Mobile devices and made it onto the list of our top ten games of 2022.",

Isaacs will take the role of Lord Enver Gortash, designer of the Steel Watchers, magical warriors tasked with protecting Baldur’s Gate after Duke Ravengard vanishes. Players will bump heads with this powerful enforcer as they find themselves in the middle of a power struggle engulfing the city. You can see his introduction in the trailer below. \n\n\n\"It was a thrill to join the Baldur’s Gate universe but I fear that the magnificent Lord Enver Gortash is being mischaracterized as a villain,\" says Isaacs in a press release. \"In a brutal world of betrayals and butchery, he’s learned to lie better and backstab first. The joy in voicing him - apart from the obvious pleasure in getting to look so glorious - was that the creative team and I got to play loose enough to find ways that he could enjoy the ride and make the players hate him more!\"\nIsaac isn’t the only famous name players will encounter.

After a long wait, fans will finally get to try it for themselves early next year.\nDeveloper Pocketpair revealed during Summer Game Fest that Palworld is launching in Steam Early Access in January. A long wait to be sure (especially since the game was last slated to enter Early Access this year), but we'll take any proof that this game is a real thing because it continues to look bonkers. \n\n\nPalworld takes place in a world where players can catch and befriend cute, legally-distinct monsters called Pals. The game features an open world that supports multiplayer (up to 8 players) where you can have Pals give a helping hand in battles or in exploration, put them to work making resources in your factories, sell them off, or just eat them. Combat unfolds as a third-person shooter with players wielding assault weapons and other guns to blast enemy Pals and other threats, or you can use Pal’s unique abilities to get the job done. In multiplayer, you can explore together, trade Pals, or steal each other's monsters and items in battle. \nWhat do you think of this latest look at Palworld? Let us know in the comments!",

The game lets you play as Alan and newcomer FBI agent Saga, who each sport separate but connected campaigns. Players can switch between the two at any time, with Saga exploring the pacific northwest while Alan tries to escape the Dark Place. Since players can change characters freely, this opens up a plethora of storytelling differences; you can even play the full game as one character if you choose. \nThe sequel’s shift to pure survival horror is shown off with the game’s heavy Resident Evil vibes as Saga riddles a terrifying killer with bullets while dodging his attacks. The trailer ends with some investigative gameplay, but we don’t get a long look at this part of the experience.\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 launches on October 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via The Epic Game Store.",

          "description": "Today’s Summer Game Fest gave us a first look at Sand Land, the new game from Bandai Namco, based on a manga by celebrated artist, Akira Toriyama.\nThe new game boasts a gorgeous art style that is unmistakably rooted in Toriyama’s style, and seems to mix action, vehicles, and fighting game mechanics together to tell a story set in a mysterious desert world.\nIt’s unknown at this point if the game will follow the same thread as the original manga. If it does, the story will follow a former general named Sheriff Rao as he tries to overcome a corrupt king with the help of the demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief. The three work together (including stealing a tank) to bring water back to a parched world.\nThere’s still much to learn about the video game adaptation, but the announcement trailer looked beautiful. Sand Land is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but no word yet on release date.",

          "description": "Sega and Sonic Team have announced Sonic Superstars, a new 2D adventure starring the company's Blue Blur. Though Sonic is the star, as the name implies, there are plenty of supporting cast members. In this reveal trailer, we also see Tails, Knuckles, and Amy appear as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities.\nFor the first time since Sonic Adventure, original Sonic the Hedgehog designer and artist Naoto Ohshima returns to the franchise. As the original designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman characters, he will bring an all-new character to the franchise through Sonic Superstars. \nSonic Superstars also introduces seven different Emerald Powers. In the trailer, we see Sonic create clones of himself and climb waterfalls, but the press release also teases \"powering up.\" \nTaking place on the North Star Islands, Sonic Superstars purports to deliver never-before-seen environments, hinting that, despite the compilation-style name, we will be speeding through all new levels instead of the usual suspects like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. The press release teases enormous creatures and evil plans from Dr. Eggman, while Fang the Sniper (AKA Nack the Weasel) from Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic the Fighters, and other games seems to appear as a secondary enemy.\nIn the trailer, we also see what look to be Special Stages that borrow from the rotating Special Stages from Sonic 1, plus a 3D Special Stage. The modernized HD graphics look great in motion, but the proof will be in how it plays, particularly following how disappointed many in the community were by Sonic the Hedgehog 4. If Sonic Team is able to nail the physics, momentum, and overall feel, Sonic Superstars could do for the 2D Sonic series what New Super Mario Bros. did for the 2D Mario series.\nSonic Superstars releases both digitally and physically for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC this fall, and will start at $60.",

          "description": "Today, over four years since the last entry in the series, we finally got a clear look at Mortal Kombat 1. Shown at Summer Game Fest, the trailer shows off a lot of gameplay, confirming a number of fighters: Scorpion, Sub Zero, Liu Kang, Kenshi, Kitana, Mileena, Raiden, and Kung Lao. You can watch the full reveal trailer below.\n\n\nThe ending of Mortal Kombat 11 allowed NetherRealm to rework the series a little bit, so this newest entry serves as a reboot of sorts. Classic characters have been put into new scenarios and have new relationships. For example, long-time rivals Scorpion and Sub-Zero are brothers now, and Liu Kang is a god of fire. Additionally, Johnny Cage is now being played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, an actor that inspired the creation of the original Mortal Kombat games.\nKameo fighters put an additional spin on the series' canon, with classic versions of characters like Kano, Sonia, and Jax jumping in to fight by your side. The new mechanic acts as an additional way to customize your characters, with a second roster available to choose as a Kameo after selecting your main fighter. While some fighters will likely be exclusive to the Kameo selection, Ed Boon has clarified that there will be some overlap – Sub-Zero can serve as both a Kameo and a normal fighter.\nMortal Kombat 1 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 19.",

The gameplay blends first-person shooting with supernatural abilities bestowed by the church.

We also catch a glimpse of Ryu fighting dinosaurs. Ostensibly, all of this takes place within Exorpimal. It's to be determined if any of the crossover content will come to Street Fighter 6.

The remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is still in development, but Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a wholly new title that feels a bit closer to Prince's original 2D roots.\n\n\nThe gameplay showed an impressive mix of flashy combat and high-speed platforming – much faster then the methodical platforming that inspired it. The protagonist, who has historically always just been called the Prince, looks a bit like his Sands of Time iteration, but otherwise appears to be a totally new character named Sargon. Regarding the story a press release for the game reads, \"In this brand-new adventure, players will embody Sargon, a young, gifted warrior, member of an elite group called The Immortals. As they are sent to rescue Prince Ghassan, they will explore Mount Qaf, a once wondrous place, now cursed and hostile. Sargon and his brothers-in-arms will soon discover that time itself will be a treacherous foe and that the world balance must be restored.\" The press release also says the game is inspired by \"the Metroidvania structure\".\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown releases January 16 on Switch, PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Amazon Luna and PC through the Epic Games Store and the Ubisoft Store. Ubisoft promises to reveal more during its Monday stream event.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy art is some of my favorite in all of games. The series' visuals fall somewhere between realism and fantasy, and it’s always fun to see how Square Enix studios leverage more powerful hardware to bring worlds to life. These settings, characters, and monsters are memorable, and a large reason for that is the art. It’s striking and unique – you know it’s Final Fantasy when you see it. \nWith each new Final Fantasy, Square Enix has a chance to solidify characters and worlds into the zeitgeist of gaming, like the company has done in the past with Final Fantasy VII’s Cloud Strife, Final Fantasy X’s Zanarkand, and more. During my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I spoke to Final Fantasy XVI art director Hiroshi Minagawa about how developer Creative Business Uni…",

On day one, we learned Rebirth is \"progressing smoothly.\" Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a \"high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories\" and that players \"will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story.\" \nFor Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: \"No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n#FF7R pic.twitter.com/vsmJZvDljw\nJune 5, 2023\nIf I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.\nRebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy \"7,\" many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.\nFor more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second chapter of the planned Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy of games, received a brief but welcomed progress report from producer Yoshinori Kitase. Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. \nIn a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.” \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\npic.twitter.com/O4KdGlh4gy\nJune 2, 2023\nWhile not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. \nFor more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

With Final Fantasy, that’s doubly the case because for me, and I imagine for so many others, the music of this series is one of its best parts. Be it lo-fi channels, new arrangements, compilations, piano versions, or something else, Final Fantasy music makes its way into many of my playlists. \nThat’s why I was so excited to chat with composer Masayoshi Soken about his score for Final Fantasy XVI. You might recognize his name as he’s also the composer of Final Fantasy XIV. Still, if you don’t, there’s a chance it’s a name you come to remember following the release of FFXVI, because after more than three hours of hands-on time with the game in Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, …",

Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams \"and see which group can win a certain number of games first,\" while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. \nEverybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. \nWhile this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. \nIt's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch. \nAre you picking up Everybody 1-2-Switch?

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",
