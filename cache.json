Sunshine is famously not as polished as other mainline 3D Marios, but it's got some great bits, too.

I'll try to do the same!\".\nIt's impossible to overstate the impact of Akira Toriyama, the legendary manga artist and character designer who has been working in the manga industry since 1978. His death at 68 years old has thousands around the world mourning his loss.\nToriyama was, to me, comfort on sick days or after school. I'd watch episodes of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z on Toonami. His art in the manga and on the show captured a sort of electric energy that felt entirely unique to him; big hair, sharp lines, expressive eyes, and bold colours — sometimes blended softly, other times (particularly in his later work) big blocks of green, gold, and orange.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you.

Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. \r\n\n\r\nThe game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it?

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

This is a step away from the studio's mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let's peer through the weeds a bit further.\nRead more",

The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. \r\n\n\r\nOr at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described \"professional fraudster\" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.\nRead more",

          "description": "As the video games industry violently contracts to ensure shareholder satisfaction at the cost of making thousands upon thousands of people unemployed, Skylanders studio Toys For Bob have announced they're splitting from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft to go independent. Good for them, but maybe too late for some. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that it seemed Activision Blizzard were closing Toys For Bob's California headquarters and laying off 86 people. Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they're working on something new and \"exploring a possible partnership\" with Microsoft.\nRead more",

We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. \nThe subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024. \nRead more",

          "description": "Interrogating enemies in Call of Duty: Warzone is a useful tactic to locate the enemy team. Like using Caveira in Rainbow Six: Siege, a downed player can be interrogated to reveal their teammates' location. However, right now, the mechanic is causing a game-breaking bug that's probably not worth the risk. Better to hold off and find those enemy locations the old fashioned way.\n\n\nInterrogating in Warzone can prevent you from swapping weapons\n\n\nAccording to a recent post from Call of Duty Updates on Twitter, an issue is under investigation where interrogating downed enemy players can prevent you from swapping weapons. The developer Trello board says the bug is active in Battle Royale, Resurgence, Plunder, and Lockdown game modes. The investigation began on Thursday, March 7.\n\n\n\n\nUntil the developers provide an update on the status of this bug, it might be worth not interrogating anyone. Swapping weapons is a rather important ability for many reasons. As such, the few seconds of locating an enemy's teammates probably isn't worth the risk. Especially in Battle Royale, where you can't exactly just die and reset very easily. \n\n\nIn other game modes, like Resurgence, there are better methods of pinging enemies on your radar. For those unaware, killing an enemy in Resurgence game modes automatically pings the rest of their team on your radar for a few seconds. As such, it's incredibly useful for players who move around and hunt for kills a lot. Flying around Fortune's Keep in the castle or another close-quarters map is much easier to survive if you know where your dead enemies' friends are.\n\nThe post Warzone players may want to avoid interrogating until a known bug is fixed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since news of Toriyama's passing broke, players have gathered outside the Pugilist’s guild in Ul’dah, many dressed as some of the creator's most beloved characters.\n\n\nAlthough best known for creating the foundational world of Dragon Ball Z, Toriyama was also renowned for his work on much-loved RPGs. From his character designs in Chrono Trigger to striking designs in Dragon Quest, Toriyama touched artists and fans within the world of anime, manga, and video games. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter which server you play on, it’s hard to miss the gathering of players in Ul’dah, decked out in cosplay in homages to the life’s works of Toriyama. There’s no end to the Goku outfits, and hundreds of people donning the Slime Crown and Thug’s Mug glamour items, inspired by Dragon Quest, and rewarded during the Breaking Brick Mountains event last held in 2021. \n\n\nAs they always do in sad times like these, players are utilising the Wanderer’s Campfire minion to light the streets of Ul’dah, and they’re likely to remain in their chosen spot for hours, or even days, in remembrance of Toriyama and all he gave to the world during his life. \n\n\n\n\nIt’s not the first time Final Fantasy XIV players have come together in honor of a treasured artist; back in 2021, the community came together after the death of Kentaro Miura, creator of the infamous Manga Berserk. Thousands of Dark Knights on every server lined the streets of Ul’dah in his memory, just as we’re seeing them do today. The community also gathered again for one of their own, Stephen Critchlow, who voiced Count Edmont de Fortemps in the Heavensward expansion. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV community pays tribute to Akira Toriyama with in-game vigils appeared first on Destructoid.",

Infogrames became Atari, which has links to Ziggurat Games, which works with publisher Tommo. So, the rights have been swirling around this big bucket.\n\n\nThat’s maybe not important. What is important is that someone at Ziggurat or Poppy Works identified it as fertile ground for a revival, even though the original wasn’t entirely acclaimed. Then, Poppy Works discarded basically everything about Slave Zero and somehow created something that pays respect to the original but is a completely original concept.\n\n\nThe result is fascinating.

          "description": "Various outlets are reporting that the influential creator of Dragon Ball and character designer for games like the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger, Akira Toriyama, died on March 1 of a subdural hematoma.\n\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a game developer in Japan who wasn’t influenced by Toriyama in some way. His work on Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball has pervaded the culture there and even found popularity in the West. Because of this recognition, he was tapped to design the characters for Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior in North America) which itself became a cultural phenomenon in its home country.\n\n\nAs Streets of Rage and Actraiser composer Yuzo Koshiro put it on Twitter, “Toriyama’s work, with its unique art style, captivating characters, and warm, comforting stories, really made an impact on us kids.”\n\n\nFrom there, Toriyama continued to work on the Dragon Quest series throughout his life. He later assisted with the creation of Chrono Trigger, often cited as one of the best RPGs ever made. He also lent his character design to the Tobal series and Blue Dragon. April will see the release of the adaptation of his manga, Sand Land.\n\n\nThis comes as quite a shock. Many people, including myself and the rest of Destructoid, are deeply saddened by this. But while Akira Toriyama may have passed too soon, his influence and his works will live on for a long, long time.\n\n\nLead image via Yahoo News.\n\nThe post Famed storyteller and artist Akira Toriyama dies at 68 appeared first on Destructoid.",

From the beginning, there was discourse among players due to the price of items, but it has gone on to become a popular addition to the game. \n\n\nHowever, the Premium Store is now a year old and it's still missing one much-desired feature — the ability to preview items before purchasing. While clothing items are displayed on a mannequin, wings aren’t. This is the main issue that has caused the latest controversy.\n\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley Small Pink Wings controversy\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThere have been four different varieties of wings that have been featured as possible purchases in the Premium Store (shown above). Judging from the photos and the price of the latest set, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the Small Pink Wings would be a similar size to the other three. \n\n\nSadly, you’d be wrong and it’s this fact that has caused upset within the Dreamlight Valley community. \n\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the wings are absolutely tiny and players feel as though they’ve been misled with the Premium Shop image, understandably, and the argument for some form of preview function has become all the stronger as a result.\n\n\nImage via Disney Pixar\n\n\nOn the plus side, these wings have sparked a slew of jokes involving Heimlich from A Bug’s Life, after he gains his rather tiny wings and turns into a ‘beautiful butterfly’. Reddit comments are filled with people sharing images and gifs of the underrated character, causing others to state that they now actually want the wings in light of the comparison.\n\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley players are upset about ‘misleading’ Premium Store item appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Since releasing to early access over ten years ago, Rust has become one of the most famous online survival games in the current era. I say \"famous\" when I really mean \"infamous\" because, as anyone who's played the game knows, it's hard as frick. What we really need is a tutorial.\n\n\nTa-da! As of now, the latest patch for Rust has started rolling out which, low and behold, implements a Tutorial Island, perfect for getting to grips with the fundamentals. According to a post over on Steam, the island offers a way of adding a \"safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of Rust before being set loose in the main game with other players.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt also says that all players will be prompted to run through the tutorial \"when they first spawn this month,\" but you can decline the offer. Here's what you'll learn:\n\n\n\nBasic movement\n\n\nCrafting\n\n\nBuilding bases\n\n\nUpgrading bases\n\n\nRespawning\n\n\nBasic combat\n\n\nResources\n\n\nLooting containers\n\n\nCooking\n\n\nUsing Furnaces\n\n\nWorkbenches\n\n\nUsing a vehicle\n\n\n\nNo mention of how to cope with being screamed at by aggressive teens\n\n\nThat's probably one of the biggest things to come out of this update. But there's also another huge improvement that's been made to Rust in the guise of better night lighting.\n\n\nThe update notes go on to say that to combat \"gamma hacking\" from players, the studio has added a \"Nightlight feature.\" Essentially, this is a shader that illuminates the immediate area in front of you at nighttime, \"mimicking the effect of natural moon light.\"\n\n\nIn short: you should now be able to see much better in the dark. It's still going to be pretty dark, though, so don't expect to be able to confidently run through the inky blackness with nary a care in the world. This is Rust, after all.\n\nThe post New Rust update adds a tutorial island for new players appeared first on Destructoid.",

It comes in two flavors as well: Priority and Ultimate, similar to the monthly memberships.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what you get, well, you'll be entitled to 24-hour access to Team Green's cloud, which includes all the usual benefits of a typical subscription, but without actually having to subscribe for a month or beyond.\n\n\nBut not 24-hour gaming\n\n\nIt should be said that you won't get to play your games through GeForce NOW for the full 24 hours. Depending on which tier you opt for, you'll get either six or eight hours of actual game time, but you'll have access to the servers for the entire day.\n\n\nAccording to the sign-up page on Nvidia's website, you can pay $3.99 for the Priority Day Pass or $7.99 for Ultimate. The latter is said to have \"exclusive access\" to the RTX 4080 servers. You'll also benefit from up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS.\n\n\nOh, but if you want to try before you buy, the report from Videocardz says there's an option to get a free hour-long session, but I couldn't see where you would sign up for that.

          "description": "With reports that Embracer Group allegedly cancelled an upcoming Deus Ex game, hopes of a return to the series have been fading. The industry is in a sad state now, so if you want to cheer yourself up with a dose of Adam Jensen, you can pick up Mankind Divided for free next week.\n\n\nThat's one of the titles being given away over on Epic Games Store. The other is an indie puzzle from 2013 called The Bridge. Both will be available between March 14 and March 21. They will be replacing the sci-fi combat game Astro Duel 2.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it may not be the most lauded Deus Ex entry out there, it's still a nice little freebie for those who have yet to play it.\n\n\nYou can't resist all that sincere moping\n\n\nThings are so up in the air for Eidos-Montreal's celebrated series. With voice actor Elias Toufexis being told to stop talking so much about Adam Jensen, there's definitely a sense that we won't ever get to see a follow-up to Mankind Divided.\n\n\nIt's a story we're all getting sick of hearing, no doubt. The video game industry is in dire straits at the moment, as huge publishers issue redundancies and studio closures. Eidos was one of those recently, which effectively put a nail in the Deus Ex coffin. Honestly, it's hard to keep up with the amount of job losses that have occurred these past 12 months or so.\n\n\nWhile we won't likely get to see a new Deus Ex entry, maybe take some comfort in being able to get a copy of the latest installment for free. Sorry, didn't mean to bring the mood down there.\n\nThe post Deus Ex: Mankind Divided will be free to keep from Epic Games Store next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

He was 68.\nThe news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry.

          "description": "No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of \"the greatest of all time\" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.\nAs Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. \nPrepare thyselves, mere mortals!\npic.twitter.com/0d91p34hCu\nMarch 7, 2024\nUnfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.\nOnly time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. \nIn the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month.

          "description": "Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new \"Cutting Edge\" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with \"high-voltage vibes,\" giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. \nWarbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new \"Acquisitions\" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. \nCheck out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWithin this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with \"wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.\" The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the \"end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'\"\nIn terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. \nYou can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. \n\nElsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. \nCutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war. \nAre you excited for Warbond – Cutting Edge in Helldivers 2?

And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. \nThe trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: \n\n\n\"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have,\" a press release reads. \"200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.\" \nAmazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. \nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. \nFor more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December.

After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. \nThis news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. \n\n\nThe timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. \nBefore Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you'll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer's ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game. \nAre you going to play Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox later this month? Let us know in the comments below!",

The game's official website has the following synopsis: \nThat includes, from what we can tell, sucking people's souls out of their bodies and telepathically blasting enemies through destructible environments. Haroona can also pull enemies, control their minds, and more. The game also features parkour-style platforming across an Indian city. \nUnknown 9: Awakening is coming this summer to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by \"himself,\" I mean multiple versions of himself.\nJan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the \"what if\" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. \n\n\nThe Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.",

The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. \nIn terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. \n\n\nDeveloper Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.\nPer the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” \nGhost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. \nGhost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.",

Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nThe 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.\nPlayers take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. \nThat's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.\n\n\nAs you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. \nIt's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series.

You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.\nI had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.\nPremiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. \n\n\nSpiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: \n\n\nOnce its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.\n\n\nThe game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. \nCataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.",

In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",

Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.",
