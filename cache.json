Indeed, it’s quite telling that, of all the possible games to revisit, this is the one that Team17 and Digital Eclipse have decided to spruce up for the Nintendo Switch.\nWe’re almost certain that those who played the original, extensively or otherwise, will already have an inkling of how this Anniversary Edition turned out. In short, it’s flippin’ great. This is the Worms Armageddon you know and love, with every mode included from the original release alongside a generous selection of documentary features detailing the creation and development of the franchise. If that’s not enough, you also get immediate access to the emulated Game Boy Color release, rounding out a clean, extensive presentation of a turn-based strategy classic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?\nRead more",

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as \"a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars\". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.\n Read more",

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges. \nRead more",

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\".

For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\".

Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers!

In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.\nFFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.\nRead more",

But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Menace, their upcoming turn-based tactical RPG, will also put the wellbeing of your chosen fighters at the forefront of your mind – along with a dramatic shift from 2D medieval sprites to the fully 3D battlefields of a unruly space frontier.\nRead more",

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its \"trunk loads of atmosphere\" but called the constant need to craft stuff \"laborious\". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.\nBuuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.\nRead more",

Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.\nIt's \"a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order\". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.\nIf monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”.

I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.\nSomething is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry.

          "description": "The Legendary Brawler, Kenji, has sliced his way over to Brawl Stars, expanding the dynamic Assassin class. While he's already a formidable fighter, the potential of a well-crafted build can elevate his performance to new heights. Here's how to create the best Kenji build in Brawl Stars.\n\n\nWhat is the best build for Kenji in Brawl Stars?\n\n\nThe premium store lets you unlock Kenji early, ahead of his free-to-play launch around Oct. 3. Equip the following items to get the best Kenji build in Brawl Stars:\n\n\n\nGadget: Hosomaki Healing\n\n\nStar Power: Nigiri Nemesis\n\n\nGear: Damage\n\n\nGear 2: Gadget Charge \n\n\n\nWhen comparing Kenji's two Gadgets, the Hosomaki Healing is the clear choice. It'll provide you with 75 percent healing for over three seconds, giving you a second chance even if your health is low. You'll improve his survivability further using the Nigiri Nemesis. The Star Power offers a 90 percent damage reduction with the next enemy attack. But, you must avoid damage for five seconds in exchange for the ability.\n\n\nThe Gadget and Star Power almost make Kenji feel like an unstoppable force. And it'll get even better once you place some Gear on him. Since we've mainly tackled Kenji's defensive capacity, it's time to enhance his attacks.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUse the Damage Gear to gain 15 percent extra damage any time his health is 50 percent. Last but not least is the Gadget Charge, increasing the usage of the Hosomaki Healing during a match. You could also go for Speed instead to make him run faster. Of course, the choice is entirely up to you, so utilize the Gear items that better suit your playstyle.\n\n\nBefore you step onto the battlefield, test out this Brawl Stars Kenji build in the Practice Match or Training Grounds. Then, you can start dominating the leaderboards with his trusty sword. If you want to try out more characters, be sure to check out our builds for Moe and Frank. \n\nThe post Best Kenji build in Brawl Stars appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a recent talk with director Alex Garland for Famitsu that got caught by Automaton Media, Hideo Kojima spilled a few interesting details about the upcoming Death Stranding movie adaptation.\n\n\n“Many of the offers I received [for Death Stranding’s movie adaptation] from other film companies proposed big-budget adaptations with extravagant explosions, but I didn’t want that. Together with A24, I want to make a slightly different film,” Kojima stated.\n\n\nDeath Stranding is being co-produced by A24, an entertainment company with a varied filmography under its belt. So far, it has been behind titles including Ex Machina, The VVitch, Pearl, Hereditary, and Best Picture Oscar winner Everything Everywhere All At Once. \n\n\nOn top of the studio's eclecticism that Kojima will surely use to let his imagination go wild, A24 is also a company known for doing a lot with little.\n\n\n\n\nStill, Kojima had some apprehensions. “With Civil War becoming a huge hit, I have a feeling that A24 is raising the budget and scale [of Death Stranding], so I’m thinking about how to suppress that.”\n\n\nEither way, Kojima stated that A24 has a unique presence in the industry, one that aligns with the vision of Kojima Productions, saying, “it will take time, but it will turn out well.” He also joked that A24 is probably the right choice, as his birthday is on August 24.\n\n\nKojima wanted to make it in movies before pivoting to the video game industry, and while he could have used this opportunity to finally jump in the director's seat, he decided to stick to a producer role. We still don't know who'll direct Death Stranding or when it'll come out, but, funnily enough, it'll likely see the light of day before the Metal Gear Solid movie adaptation. \n\n\nAs for the game sequel, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, is set to release sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Death Stranding movie won’t be an explosion-filled blockbuster appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, it already has some cute animations and you can kind of see what they're going for in the video below. \n\n\n\n\nThis is Fine: Maximum Cope has players traversing worlds based on very real anxieties, including Humiliation, Fear, Failure, Loss, and Regret. In addition to taking on enemies that embody everyday worries, you'll have to face off against larger Anxiety Bosses. Defeating them and capturing their essence in a Worry-Box will net you new abilities that help Question Hound head into new areas.\n\n\nSpeaking of the dog at the center of it all, most of his abilities so far have to do with his trusty hat. He can toss it, shrink it small enough to fit inside it, and even use it as a boat. He can also use his tail as a helicopter and fire off a bark blast. \n\n\nNo really, this is fine! \n\n\nScreenshot via Kickstarter Campaign\n\n\nKC Green is working with Numskull Games on this one. Reward tiers include a digital copy of the game, the physical release, a collector's edition, t-shirt bundle, and so on. The \"Big One\" is a $1,500 tier that includes everything else plus an in-game cameo featuring Green's illustration of you. \n\n\nThis will probably be fully funded in the coming hours. When This is Fine: Maximum Cope eventually launches — it's currently eyeing a March 2026 delivery — it should be available on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. \n\nThe post ‘This is Fine’ dog gets his own platformer from original creator KC Green appeared first on Destructoid.",

Doing so gets you a free pack and a set of coin boosts. At the start of a new game, it's always beneficial to grind as many packs as possible. Let's take a look at how you can complete the latest mystery objective and the rewards you'll earn.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Early Access Mystery Nations objective\n\n\nThe Early Access Mystery Nations objective is pretty simple to look at. There's only one task, and here's the condition.\n\n\n\nWin a game using at least one player in your starting lineup from each of the three Mystery Nations in any game mode. The names of the nations will be hinted at during the Early Access Broadcast.\n\n\n\nTo complete this objective, you'll need to win at least one match with one player from England, Belgium, and Spain. Make sure to use at least one player from each of these three nations. You can use more if you want, and the match can be from any Ultimate Team mode.\n\n\n\n\nI always prefer the Squad Battles mode to complete such objectives, but the Friendly mode is fine as well. You can play with your friend to complete the objective, and the results won't matter as well. By completing the objective, you'll earn one Premium Gold Players Pack and a set of coin boosts. Both rewards are beneficial. With the RTTK promo coming up soon, you can also choose to save your pack and open it once unique cards have been added to the packs.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete Early Access Mystery Nations objective? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Despite being released, you may experience a bug where the Grey Play Button on Steam is unclickable, and therefore you cannot play. Here is how to fix the Throne and Liberty 'Grey Play Button' bug.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat to do if you can't click the Play button\n\n\nFor some players, the play button for Throne and Liberty is grayed out and not clickable. Furthermore, if you check in the Downloads section on Steam, it shows the MMORPG as Unscheduled but when you try to click to manually download, it says Game Not Released. Unfortunately, this appears to be a launch-time bug that is affecting a small set of players. Amazon has confirmed the issue is a bug and that they are currently working to get a fix out ASAP for the issue.\n\n\nWhile awaiting the bug fix, some players have had success by trying the following fixes for the 'Grey Play Button' bug on Throne and Liberty:\n\n\n\nGo Offline then back Online on Steam. Do this by clicking the Steam menu button in the top left and then going to 'Go Offline...'.\n\n\nRestart Steam. Make sure you close out of Steam completely, then relaunch it in Administrator Mode.\n\n\nVerify File Integrity. Right-click on Throne and Liberty in your Library then go to Properties. Next, click Installed Files on the left, then Verify Integrity of Game Files.\n\n\nUninstall and Reinstall Throne and Liberty. Make sure the game is completely uninstalled before reinstalling it via Steam.\n\n\n\nThe main issue with this bug is that it does not allow you to unpack the Throne and Liberty game files, therefore you can't launch or even create a shortcut for the game. If you're able to get to the step of unpacking, the play button will become clickable.\n\nThe post How to fix Throne and Liberty ‘Grey Play Button’ bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

Keep trying if you don't find Topaz in your first run of mining. Wait five minutes, and then the rocks should reappear. I had to do this four or five times before one emerged. You may find Garnet, which is red, as well.

Výborní herci, výborná atmosféra jednotlivých scén, ale velmi brzy jsem se přestal snažit chápat, co si z toho mám vlastně odnést.
