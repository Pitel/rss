And, boy, does Nintendo know it.\nYes, as flagged by Games Radar, Nintendo of America has filed an opposition to the attempt to trademark the term 'PokeZoo'. This 'new' IP was set to be a trading card game which boasts, according to its website description, \"groundbreaking mechanics that break the 4th Wall\".

          "description": "\"At the initial idea stage, we collected over 1,000 ideas\".\n\nWhile the Super Mario series can get quite weird with its lore, world design, and general concepts, nothing comes close to the sheer absurdity of the WarioWare franchise. How many games out there let you pick someone's nose, perform dental work, and have a back-scratching competition with Mario? While on paper these activities may sound like the last things you'd want to spend your coveted game time on, they're executed masterfully and delightful to play.\nFor decades, we've been puzzled as to how the folks over at Intelligent Systems and Nintendo come up with the microgames that make up the WarioWare series. Where do these ideas come from? How many are left on the drawing board? Where does one even begin to develop so many different micro projects? To get some answers, we recently had the chance to chat with Goro Abe, who was not only the Chief Director on the latest game WarioWare: Move It!, but has been with the series almost exclusively as a programmer, designer, and director since the very beginning.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Designed to represent the WarioWare, Inc. company, it showcases information on the main man himself, his employees, and the franchise's history.

I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.\nSo where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.\nRead more",

Because let's face it. Everything PlayStation comes to PC eventually. We just have a wait a couple of years for it. Just look at former exclusive Horizon Forbidden West, which is hitting PC on March 21st. That wasn't in tonight's showcase, of course, so let's take a look at everything that was.

Set in 19th century Japan's Bakumatsu era, the game is a mixture of open-ended exploration, sneaking and agile traversal that puts me heavily in mind of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series. Unlike most Assassin's Creeds, however, this one has a pretty in-depth, rigorous melee combat system, with bosses that look like they're going to grind my gears no end. Will it be as vicious as Nioh 2? I'd better start stocking up on comfort food.\r\n \nRead more",

It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build.

It taps into the same checklist clearing compulsion that saw me spend over 100 hours in both Odyssey's Ancient Greek archipelago and the Viking open world of Valhalla - only instead of chasing map icons that take you down weird sidequest rabbit holes that riff on Fenton the (sheep)dog, or gobbling up story events just so you can make googly eyes at every warm-blooded human in a ten mile radius, Palworld hooks you in with its enormous catalogue of base building tasks. Not catching the 100+ Pal monsters roaming around its mysterious islands, but crafting the perfect sweatshop to put them to work in. It's one of those, \"I'll just add this furnace so I can craft some ingots that will let me make a cooking pot to level up my base, but wait, now I need some ore to make those ingots, and oh god, I've just spent seven hours doing not very much at all, have I?\"\nRead more",

For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.   \nRead more",

It's murder on the old kneecaps, but as any shrewd parental tactician knows, Horsey is a game with a sting in its tail (making this a kind of scorpion Horsey, I guess). The horse in the game of Horsey is free to choose the direction of travel, even if it's somewhere the rider would rather not go. Towards the bath or dinner table, for instance. Towards the dentist, if needed. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Not only had we cleared out the 42nd floor of the cursed extra-dimensional horror house that was our school’s midnight alter-ego, I’d also just aced my midterms. I spent the afternoon helping my french foreign exchange friend sew a kimono for his estranged uncle, then killed some time before bed by consoling the small child I’d been hanging out with lately about her parent’s divorce.\r\n\n\r\nSo goes an average day in one of the very, very many days stuffed into Persona 3 Reload’s year long taste of demon-slaying high school life. A charming fantasy? Perhaps! There's plenty here for fans who don’t mind an old-school approach to grinding while exploring heartfelt, albeit cheesy, friendships. Those who don't get on with anime tropes, though, might find it exhaustingly written and repetitive. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.\nAs a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.\n \nRead more",

It's a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either.

          "description": "Who'd have thought toilet plungers would make for such good jumping assistants when it comes to propelling yourself over big, thorny brambles and angry animals? Well, clearly the trio of developers at Phoenix Blasters did, as their upcoming platformer Telmari puts them front and centre as its main form of traversal. Your titular tiny heroine can't jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she'll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem. I've been playing its Steam demo this morning, and while it's a little rough around the edges, there's definitely something here for those trained in the Super Meat Boy school of pixel perfect platforming.   \nRead more",

          "description": "Friends, it is finally time for me to discourse unto you about my great love of balls. The roots of my enthusiasm go back to pinball machines - both the fancier, arcade variety that transmogrify into e.g. screaming robot skulls when you achieve a high-enough multiplier, and the crappy, play-at-home variety that are basically a canted wooden sheet with some numbers drawn on it. But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. \r\n\n\r\nInitiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.\n  \nRead more",

The closest we've come to a \"Dinn-like\" is probably 2022's outstanding The Case Of The Golden Idol, though as I said in my review, its fill-in-the-blanks murder tableaus felt just about distinct enough to be their own separate thing. \nHappily, the \"Golden Idol-like\" appears to be having a bit of a moment of its own right now, as Playstack, the publishers of Golden Idol, have just announced the delightful-looking Little Problems, a detective game that turns its word-shuffling problem-solving to the altogether more relatable conundrums of everyday life.

I got an early look at the demo, and it’s a pretty bland taste, but it’s not necessarily indicative of a problem.\n\n\nI think it’s difficult to build a demo of any narrative-centric game. Usually, these sorts of titles have a slow build with character introductions, and they may not begin any meaty twisting until later in the game.

However, as Pocketpair sends out another patch to fix a variety of bugs, the game continues to experience more popularity than...well, a very very popular thing.\n\n\nVersion 0.1.4.0 has been rolling out on Steam, with a lot of fixes being implemented. For starters, there's been an issue where players have been receiving damage twice. This has now been patched out. Also, players will \"no longer pass through walls when dismounting.\" That was a thing, it seems.\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward, expect a lot more Palworld updates. The developer says it's going to continue development, \"placing top priority on fixing major problems and issues.\" Given the current state of the game, fans would probably expect nothing less than bug fixes. Oh, also the update for the Xbox version is expected soon.\n\n\nNot enough people in Ecuador to play\n\n\nAlong with the recent patch, Pocketpair also gave the good word on Twitter/X that the game has experienced more than 19 million players. That's 12 million on PC and seven million on Xbox. That's about as much as...a very very large thing (I'm not good at analogies today, it seems).\n\n\nA few days ago, Palworld smashed through the two million concurrent player mark, according to SteamDB. It's become one of – if not the – fastest-selling game in recent memory. Two weeks. It came out just two weeks ago.\n\n\nWe're still waiting to hear what Nintendo/The Pokémon Company will turn up in its investigation. For now, Palworld continues to be as huge as...you know what...you can take it from here.\n\nThe post Palworld v0.1.4.0 out now on Steam, also game hits 19 million players appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, you aren't there to enjoy the countryside, so a lot of time was given to illustrating the combat which features blades and even a flamethrower. \n\n\n\n\nTaking place during the final years of the 19th century, the game depicts the Boshin War. you'll be able to create your own character and engage in combat with various weapons.

          "description": "There's something comforting in not only Death Stranding getting a sequel, but its trailers not getting any less strange. In fact, today's State of Play trailer was maybe the most bizarre look yet, spotlighting an entire new region for Sam to connect, and a release window of 2025.\n\n\nNow apparently dubbed Death Stranding 2 On The Beach, I'm not sure where to start with all this. Sam \"Porter\" Bridges, portrayed again by Norman Reedus, is back in the lead. Fragile is back too, with a hand-based neck apparatus that can act as both a mask and as just, uh, hands.\n\n\n\n\nSam and pals are back on a new journey to save humanity from extinction amidst the Death Stranding, where enemies are still around every corner. We see packages being delivered, people floating in the air, and plenty of familiar iconography. But there are plenty of twists and turns.\n\n\nHiggs looks to be back, as a Joker-fied version of himself, shredding a guitar while fighting a robot samurai with a baby voice. Still processing that one. There's also a puppet companion, almost like a Jiminy Cricket-style character? Who can do vampire eyes? It's wild.\n\n\nHonestly, bring it on. I'd always rather have something weird and outside my expectations run headfirst into walls than something that feels too safe. And while Death Stranding 2 certainly seems like it's iterating on the original, there's plenty of new and weird here to keep me interested.\n\n\nDeath Stranding 2 is planned for 2025.\n\nThe post Death Stranding 2 is coming in 2025, just as long as it takes to digest the trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Metro Awakening serves as a prequel to the original Metro games that has been built from the ground up for VR as a story-driven first-person adventure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This origins story is so essential to me,\" said Dmitry Glukhovsky, who is also serving as a lore consultant for Metro Awakening. \"It feels like returning to the foundations and roots of the series - now at the level that VR technology can bring.\"\n- Dmitry Glukhovsy, Author and Creator of Metro and Lore Consultant on Metro Awakening\n\n\n\nSurvivors of Nuclear Armageddon cling to life in buried subways of the Moscow Metro where ghosts and spirits haunt the living. Players will quite literally—via VR—step into the role of Serdar, a doctor and rationalist. Players have to brave the darkness, crippling radiation, and deadly threats of Metro in search of Serdar's wife and the medication she desperately needs.\n\n\nI'm still not 100% sold on VR but Metro is a pretty creepily immersive series, so I think this could turn out to be a good experience if done right. It's promising that rather than doing some sort of port, Vertigo Games is developing Metro Awakening with the features of the PlayStation 5 and PS VR2 in mind from the start.\n\n\nMetro Awakening is set to release on PS VR2, Meta Quest 2 and 3, and PC VR in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe post Metro getting the VR treatment with Metro Awakening appeared first on Destructoid.",

As we had seen before, Stellar Blade has a lot of sci-fi and action in store. Following the protagonist's fight to reclaim Earth from a malevolent force, it certainly looks like it's got some spectacle in store.\n\n\n\n\nReally, Stellar Blade seems to wear its inspirations on its sleeve, at least to me. There's a lot of NieR: Automata here, and maybe some light Xenoblade and other sci-fi too. But I like the blend. It's got some identity of its own too, with some gorgeous graphics and an almost Scarlet Nexus-style brand of cyberpunk around it.\n\n\nI could certainly go for sci-fi action, and this looks like it could be a bit of a surprise in April.

          "description": "Cygames is really pushing the Granblue Fantasy IP to all-new heights. The first game from the franchise launched almost a decade ago exclusively in Japan as a mobile and browser-based JRPG. Over 35 million people played this iteration of the game, but it never really made it to the West other than an English patch.\n\n\nGranblue Fantasy: Relink is somewhat of a reimagination of the original game, but as a full-fledged action RPG. Instead of waiting out timers or saving up for gacha pulls, you'll progress through a series of missions unlocking new quests and characters along the way. More importantly, you'll engage in real-time action RPG as opposed to tapping buttons when it's your turn to attack.\n\n\nThe best way to describe how Granblue Fantasy: Relink plays is this: Fast-paced action combat …",

          "description": "Kiss kiss, it's February  — or close enough, at least. That means Final Fantasy XIV is wrapping up January's festivities and moving on to the next big thing with its 2024 Valentine-themed celebrations, Valentione's Day. More importantly, did you see the new emote?\n\n\nStarting on February 7, 2024, at 12 am PST (until February 21), you can begin the FFXIV Valentione's Day seasonal event and add the Love Heart emote to your collection. Dote, my once go-to emote for greeting friends, is now out. Love Heart is in. It probably doesn't need to be a competition, but it's too cute to miss or ignore.\n\n\n\nThere's also a chair, I guess. (Image via Square Enix)\n\n\n\nThe Symbol of Love quest begins with Astrid in Old Gridania (X:10.2, Y:9.4), and awaits locked behind the usual Level 15 requirement. My guess, barring any wild unforeseen surprises deviating from a decade of FFXIV events, is that Astrid's quest lands you the Love Heart emote, while the nearby House Valentione maid sells the Valentione's Heart Chair.\n\n\nCan't tell you what I'll do with the chair yet, but I'll certainly buy dozens and forget them on a retainer  —  just in case I have need for a room of heart chairs. It's not the first gaudy, love-dovey furniture I've turned my nose up at, but all is forgiven for the emote that makes my miqo'te look as cute as a K-pop star.\n\n\nFor now, that's all we know of this year's Valentione celebrations, but you can watch the Lodestone explainer for updates. Until then, check out our handy FFXIV seasonal event calendar, and get your glamour goodies from The Maiden's Rhapsody.  \n\nThe post Goodbye Dote, I’m only using the new Valentione heart emote in FFXIV now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We last got a look at the latest project from Onion Games, Stray Children, back in September during the Japanese Nintendo Direct. At the time it was set for winter 2024 in Japan, but those plans have changed and the RPG has now been moved to a general 2024 release window (via Gematsu). \n\n\nThe official Onion Games Twitter account shared the news about the delay. They said the entire staff is working on Stray Children every day, and they would appreciate it if everyone could give them a little more time.\n\n\n\n\nWith the future of Stray Children in mind, the official website is also hosting a survey. It includes questions and answers in both English and Japanese, and asks everything from basic demographics to Switch game format preference, language options, merchandise, additional platforms, and crowdfunding. They also want to know your favorite RPG and which Onion Games you've played before, so if you're a fan who's looking forward to Stray Children you might want to take a moment to fire off some responses.\n\n\nOnion Games has a handful of very interesting games to its name, including Million Onion Hotel, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and Black Bird. Stray Children is a new RPG from the studio that has some of the Moon staff on board, so there's a lot of promise there already. Here's the previous trailer for those who missed it:\n\n\n\n\nHopefully we'll find out a more concrete release date soon, but if it means a stronger showing, we don't mind the wait at all. \n\nThe post Onion Games’ latest RPG Stray Children delayed from winter to just ‘2024’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

No release date has been announced, but it's intended for both Rock Band and Fornite Festival through instrument support that's coming sometime this year.\n\n\n\n\nThe Riffmaster is wireless and will have two versions, each compatible with either the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

          "description": "It appears that developer Tokyo RPG Factory will be merging into Square Enix. According to Gematsu, as part of an absorption-type merger, Square Enix will inherit all assets and liabilities of Tokyo RPG Factory and the subsidiary will be dissolved and cease to exist. The company was established back in June 2015 as a Square Enix subsidiary to develop I am Setsuna and would go on to also develop Lost Sphear and Oninaki.\n\n\n\n\nJRPG Developer since 2015\n\n\nTokyo RPG Factory released all three of its titles in a roughly three-year span between 2016-2019. That means it's been almost five years since we've heard or seen anything from Tokyo RPG Factory, which is a big difference compared to its nearly annual releases.\n\n\nAll three releases were highly anticipated for their classic JRPG style, but never quite hit the level of success the company surely was hoping for. I am Setuna currently has a 7.4/10 on Metacritic while Lost Sphear and Oninaki are both just under 7/10 at 6.8 and 6.9 respectively. Destructoid's Chris \"The Legend\" Carter gave Oninaki a 6.5/10 back in 2019 stating \"Maybe Tokyo RPG Factory should look at changing their formula and scaling down to tighter 10 hour adventures.\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like we might not get to see that possibility.\n\nThe post Square Enix absorbs I am Setsuna developer Tokyo RPG Factory appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'm talking a little more fashion-forward; fewer shades of black and white or gamer green.\n\n\nFolks looking for the latter, Xbox is adding a little more variety to your collection. A new line of Xbox Vapor controllers is rolling out. The best part is that you can choose the one that Microsoft has already cooked up. Or, you can concoct one for yourself in the Xbox Design Lab. \n\n\n\n\nXbox started the vapor look with the Stormcloud Vapor Wireless Controller that debuted in August. It must have been pretty popular, as we're getting an entire line of custom controller options based on the vapor look. \n\n\nThe Xbox team did create a new iteration of the Vapor series that will retail separately from the Xbox Design Lab choices. Dubbed the Dream Vapor Special Edition controller, it sports a cool-looking pink and purple tone that, of course, features all the swirlies. The controller is listed for $69.99 on the Xbox Store and will be released on February 6.\n\n\nXbox Series X|S Dream Vapor controller\n\n\nAs for your options in the Xbox Design Lab, Microsoft revealed that there will be six top-case options to choose from. Styles include Electric Vapor, Noctural Vapor, Fire Vapor, and Cyber Vapor. As well as the OG Stormcloud Vapor and new Dream Vapor styles that you can customize more to your liking. \n\n\nLike most Series X|S official controllers, the Vapor series comes with up to 40 hours of battery life, Bluetooth and Xbox Wireless connectivity, a hybrid D-Pad, textured bumper, trigger, and side cap grips, as well as diamond-patterned grips for a comfortable feel on the back. \n\n\nChoosing a Vapor series look within the Xbox Design Lab adds a $9.99 upcharge to your custom Xbox Series X|S controller. You can begin workshopping ideas as of today.\n\nThe post Sick looking Vapor series controllers coming to Xbox Design Lab and retail appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mojang and Microsoft released the Godzilla-themed DLC by Japanese studio Team-KYO on the Minecraft Marketplace today. According to the Minecraft blog, players will start in movie theater screening rooms before picking one of four adventures from the iconic Godzilla films.\n\n\n\n\nGodzilla!\n\n\nLook, I know Minecraft gets a ton of DLC. And honestly, I'm usually not too interested in it. But come on, it's Godzilla! Obviously, the King of Monsters himself is featured in the DLC, but based on the trailer, other monsters will be making an appearance including Gigan, King Kong, and King Ghidorah. Maybe we'll even see Mechagodzilla, right?\n\n\nIt looks like each of the four adventures in the DLC has its own gameplay modes. The blog told us about two. In the first, players have to flee from Godzilla in an escape mission. In the second, players are tasked with speed building to create walls and obstructions in an attempt to contain Godzilla and save the city. All four adventures can be played in multiplayer and have unique rewards for completing and exploring them.\n\n\nThe Minecraft Godzilla DLC is available now on the Minecraft Marketplace for 1510 Minecoins. The closest amount to that you can purchase is 1720 Minecoins for $9.99.\n\nThe post Minecraft unleashes The King of Monsters with Godzilla DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following up on the initial announcement, Ufouria: The Saga 2 has locked in a March 1, 2024 date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\n\nSunsoft shared a new trailer via the IGN YouTube channel, highlighting more of the follow-up's fantastic looking stop-motion felt style. It's got a bit of a Kirby's Epic Yarn vibe to it, and the animation really sells the diorama aesthetic. \n\n\n\n\nUfouria: The Saga was originally released for Famicom in 1991 as the first entry in Sunsoft's Hebereke series. A European release followed in 1992, but folks in North America didn't get a chance to try it out until it hit the Wii Virtual Console in 2010. If that port and its re-…",

          "description": "Blizzard revealed the next limited-time event coming to Diablo 4 as Lunar Awakening. A mysterious phenomenon is taking over the shrines throughout Sanctuary, empowering them. By activating these shrines players will earn 50% bonus XP, have their movement speed increased by 30%, and will earn Ancestor's Favor reputation. The event goes live on February 6 at 1 p.m. EST and will run for two weeks until February 20 at 1 p.m. EST. Unlike some events that have been exclusive to seasonal servers, this event will be active on the Eternal Realms as well.\n\n\n\n\nMoon, wake up!\n\n\nWith the Lunar Awakening event, players can visit a new hub in the northern section of Ked Bardu. There players will find a new NPC, Ying- Yue, and the Lunar Night Market. As players find and activate Lunar Shrines throughout Sanctuary—including in dungeons—they will gain the experience and movement speed buff while also earning Ancestor's Favor reputation for slaying enemies while under the effects of the Lunar Shrines.\n\n\nWith the new reputation, players will ascend through ten reputation levels and obtain event-exclusive Lunar-themed rewards. There are six unique rewards in total, and look to be all different types of cosmetics including a Mount, Mount Armor, weapon skins, armor, and more.\n\n\nAlso part of the event, Nightmare Dungeon Sigils can have the Ancestor's Favor affix during the event. This affix guarantees that only Lunar Shrines will spawn in the dungeon, and also gives 10% bonus Glyph XP for completing the dungeon.\n\n\nThe event sounds rather simplistic in nature, which sort of seems to be the trend so far with Diablo 4 Season 3. Of course, I'm always up for bonus XP and the ability to earn some cool free cosmetics.\n\n\nThe Diablo 4 Lunar Awakening Event goes live on February 6 across all platforms.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Lunar Awakening Event calls on the power of the moon next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Duke Nukem table appears to have been removed. I’ll get to that. However, in its place, there is the spin-off table (Devil’s Island) and two brand new tables based on Missile Command and Centipede. Not a bad deal.\n\n\nBalls of Steel was developed by Wildfire Studios (with help from Apogee/3D Realms/The Pinball Wizard) and published by GT Interactive in 1997. If we track the lineage, GT Interactive was acquired by Infogrames in 1999, which later became the modern-day Atari. That would be why it’s Atari releasing a remaster of it. That is, assuming everyone has the rights ownership figured out.\n\n\n\n\nAs for why the Duke Nukem table …",

According to the tweet, players can join the Normandy Crew with armor inspired by Commander Shepard, Garrus Vakarian, Liara T'Soni, and others from the Systems Alliance. The armor is set to drop in Destiny 2 on February 13.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely a Win\n\n\nLet's be honest, Destiny 2 fans haven't had much to be happy about lately. Not that an armor cosmetic alone is suddenly going to flip the frustrations the dedicated fanbase currently has with the game. But regardless of the impact, a Mass Effect crossover is a win in my book. I haven't played Destiny 2 in years but you bet I wanna grab that sweet Garrus armor in preparation for my return in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.\n\n\nBungie also revealed that in celebration of the collaboration with Bioware, an Enhanced Defense Ghost Shell, Alliance Scout Frigate Ship, and Alliance Drop Ship Sparrow will all be available for free as well. It seems like these are all just cosmetic skins for the various items in Destiny 2. I hope the ship and sparrow are cool.\n\n\nThe Mass Effect-inspired armor pack, called the Alliance Requisition Bundle, is set to arrivate on all platforms on February 13.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 is crossing over with some Mass Effect armor in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.\nSonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.\nIn July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. \"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced,\" Iizuka says. \"The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time.\"\nBy adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.\nSonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here. You can also visit our exclusive coverage hub by heading here.",

The news was announced during today’s State of Play.\nThe game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. \n\n\nInterestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.",

Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.\nIf that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. \n\n\nKojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. \nHe then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"",

The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, \"These days I am Fragile in name only,\" before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.\n\n\nThe trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.\n\nOther interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.\nThe trailer ended with the phrase, \"Should we have connected?\" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.",

Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new free experience that'll be available later today.\nCheck out the trailer below to see it for yourself. Though as a quick heads-up, there are brief scenes of self-harm.\n\n\nThe Short Message trailer looks conspicuously like the alleged leaked images for a new Silent Hill game we saw back in February 2022 that Konami DMCA'd. As Polygon detailed at the time, the leaker \"Dusk Golem offered some hints at its narrative, naming two characters (Anita and Maya) and hinting that SMS messages would factor into the game somehow.\" This lines up with much of what's in the trailer.\nDespite the previous leak, The Short Message was still a bit of a surprise, as it's yet another new Silent Hill project but wasn't one of the many annoucned back in 2022, which revealed the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, the maligned Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as Silent Hill f and Silent Hill: Townfall. It appears the future of Silent Hill is as bright as it is foggy.",

The title was one of the more well-liked Sonic games of the era, alongside Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed. During today's PlayStation State of Play, Sega announced a new version of Sonic Generations called Sonic x Shadow Generations.\n\n\nAs the name implies, Sonic x Shadow Generations remasters the well-liked title for modern consoles but adds various enhancements. While 60 frames-per-second performance is already attainable by playing the Xbox 360 version on an Xbox Series X console, Sonic x Shadow Generations brings much more to the table. In addition to remastering the Sonic levels, this version adds Shadow as a playable character alongside new levels for him.\nSonic x Shadow Generations will be available this fall for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Not only did we see plenty of gameplay in a new trailer, but PlayStation and developer ShiftUp revealed the game is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 26. \nPlayers will take control of Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad. Her mission is simple: save the planet. She was supposed to do this with the rest of her squad, but most were lost in the descent to Earth. However, she finds two friends in Adam, who lives on Earth, and Lily, a member of the 5th Airborne Squad who provides Eve with engineering support. Lily will help Eve unlock new abilities like Double Jump. \nCheck out that double jump and more in the Stellar Blade gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn Xion, a city built under the wasteland of Earth by the planets' last survivors, Eve is called Angel by the survivors, and seen as an object of both awe and fear. However, they'll loosen up as Eve shows commitment to building the city. Survivors will ask Eve for help with things like rescuing sisters in need or finding lost cats. These requests will send her out into the dangerous desert wasteland, where Eve will run into dangerous robots and alien-like monsters called Naytibas. \nStellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024. \nFor more, check out this gameplay trailer from 2021 when Stellar Blade was still called Project Eve. \nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.\nAn app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. \n[Warning]\nJanuary 31, 2024\nPocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. \nPalworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year.

The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.\nAs for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.\nWhat are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play?

Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation.
