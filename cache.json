Number one; aside from the spectacular Sonic Mania (which was developed by Christian Whitehead, Headcannon, and PagodaWest), this is really the first pure '2D' Sonic game since the much-maligned two episodes of Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and number two; it's primarily being developed by Arzest, a team perhaps best known for co-developing Balan Wonderworld alongside Square Enix.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Like many ports from the PS4 and Xbox One, there was always a concern that Netherrealm Studio’s cinematic fighter wouldn’t be able to cut it on Nintendo’s hybrid console. Still, with 60fps performance and all the content you could possibly want, it proved to be a more-than-competent option for Switch owners.\nIts direct sequel and semi-reboot, Mortal Kombat 1, aims to crank everything up a couple of notches, boasting stunning visuals and an expanded combat system that lets you call in additional ‘Kameo’ fighters to assist you in battle. After the gameplay reveal at Summer Game Fest, we managed to go hands-on with Netherrealm’s latest effort for roughly 30 minutes and came away utterly gobsmacked. And, honestly? It makes us worried about the Switch version.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.\nThe countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, \"five, four, three!\", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of \"Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass\". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ahead of the launch of its Steam Next Fest demo next week, I've been playing a substantial early build of Mimimi Games' latest stealth strategy game, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. \nAs you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th. \nRead more",

I didn't get to see any of Alan himself, but I did get to see a slice of horror, investigation, and action as the other playable character Saga Anderson. And without a doubt, Remedy are making a big push for this to be a detective game alongside a survival horror one. My first impressions? Yeah, strong.\nRead more",

It's the Annapurna one masterminded by Jeppe Carlsen, the lead gameplay designer for Playdead's Inside. And in the 30 minutes I spent with it, I actually sat up on the sofa and did a colossal goblin lean towards the telly in full view of everyone. I needed to commune properly with the mighty insect lad, who hoists orbs that contain entire worlds onto his back in the game's wonderful mix of puzzler and top-down action.

I'm having a decent, if mildly monotonous time so far, mostly because I haven't unlocked all my Druid's abilities just yet, but I'm keen to keep going with it, mostly because I just like turning into a bear and a wolf every three seconds to whack some evil skelly boys, innit. When I was logging off the other day, though, I had a fleeting glance at Diablo 4's shop. Not to actually buy anything, I should stress. I'm not one for cosmetics in any shape or form. But I just wanted to see what ludicrous things it was trying to sell me for real human money. And one item for sale was, of course, some fancy horse armour, and it cost six English pounds and thirty nine pence. £6.39! For a mangey rope bridle and a bone dagger on its side! (You can see it in the header image up top there). Ridiculous, I exclaimed, and promptly shut down my PC. \nThe next morning, I was talking about this daft bit of armour with the RPS Treehouse when Alice0 suddenly introduced me to the weird and wonderful world of cheap horse games on Steam. After all, why spend upwards of £6 on a pointless cosmetic item when you could feasibly put that money toward 6 whole horse games that have actually dozens of horses in them? So join me as we discover how many horse games you can buy on Steam for the same price as Diablo 4's horse armour. \nRead more",

That was no more than two years ago, and I'll throw hands if anyone suggests otherwise. But apparently enough time has passed that just about every 4X game that came out that year has now been superceded by a newer title in the series. Civilization: Beyond Earth, Galactic Civilizations 3, Age Of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend made 2014 an incredibly strong year for strategy games, but nowadays, who really still plays these older entries?\nI don't mean to sound derisive. It's a sombre truth. At 233 hours, I've put more time into Endless Legend than any other 4X strategy game in my Steam library, and loved every minute of it. To this day it's still the best in the genre when it comes to sparking the imagination of my chronically fantasy-loving brain. The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly. It's a simply splendid game. The question is whether it's still worth playing today.\n Read more",

Blasphemous 2, which was only revealed back in April, looks to be similar to the fist game, i.e. it's a side-scrolling Soulslike drenched in the most bloody and grim Christian imagery you can think of.

But at long last, Saltsea Chronicles has made its debut at tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, and I can finally unburden myself and let out 90 days' worth of fizz pop excitement for this gorgeous new adventure game. \nSet on a flooded, post-apocalyptic Earth, creative director Hannah Nicklin described it to me like this: \"What if you were watching Star Trek, but you get to choose where they go, who's on the adventure and what they get to say?\" It's a tantalising premise, especially when it's all packaged up in the same crisp, pastel colour palette as the perpetually stunning Mutazione. The Star Trek reference isn't just for show, either. You might only be visiting different islands rather than whole planets during the course of Saltsea Chronicles, but it does have a natty, Alexander Courage-grade theme tune that plays between its chapters. The most exciting thing about this oceanic trek, however, is its incredibly cool save system that lets you dip in and out of different story branches to explore different paths and opportunities as you see fit. Let me tell you all about it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Seems like there'll be plenty more bloodthirsty creatures and god-like monsters to get a'brawling with in Remnant 2 - that's the case from the looks of the new trailer revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest, at least. We've already seen a teaser of Gearbox Publishing's upcoming action-survival sequel, but this one seriously pulls out all the stops.

          "description": "Some time back I made fun of the preview for Immortals Of Aveum because a) it was quite a silly hands-off preview and b) Immortals Of Aveum is very clearly a game that needs to be played to properly get to grips with it. It's out on July 20th, so not too far away. Have I played it yet? No! Of course not! But we're getting closer to a hands on, and after a six-minute video of the magic FPS in action last month, tonight's Summer Game Fest threw us a big, bombastic boss fight on top of a steampunk Jaeger, or something. I dunno, it was hard to tell over the light show. Those sure are a lot of magical fireworks going off. I like it. Jangle some more keys in front of me, games man.\n\nThe video itself is, uh, well, it's not long, and it's quite choppy. While I enjoy a good setpiece, my concerns remain the same as before, i.e. the magic shooting, despite the different flavours of magic broadly corresponding to a different kind of gun, looks pretty weightless, and the enemies look bullet spongey. I do like the colours and the traversal, though.\n Read more",

After 13 years the sort of Twin Peaksy, sort of Stephen Kingy action adventure game is getting a much-requested sequel this October 17th, although this time it's a survival horror, and Alan is sharing screen time equally with an FBI agent co-protagonist. Lake told us a little bit more about said agent Saga Anderson, leading into a first glimpse of \"raw gameplay\" (as opposed to cooked?) that showed her in action. I have to say, my first impression is that Saga is a terrible FBI agent who is going to ruin the chain of evidence if this ever goes to court because this woman will not put on gloves to handle a goddamn thing.\nRead more",

We got to see high-performance vehicles ripping through the main streets of USA, the neon glow of Japan, and, for the very first time, the tropical paradise of Oahu. We then saw an orange Lambo which, apparently, \"you are excited about as I am\".\nYou're not the Ubiboss of me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuvaE7VhhjY\nMore importantly, it was announced that Motorfest players can import their current garages of prized vehicles into the new game absolutely free of charge.

I would have been more excited for a game, but that’s just me. This is not that. It is not a sequel to Blood Dragon. It's a show that is coming to Netflix this Fall.\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon was a standalone expansion to Far Cry 3 that, in a rare move for Ubisoft, looked like it was made by people having fun with their work. Unfortunately, it looks like Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix isn’t really… that. It’s not looking very parody ‘80s cyberpunk.\nhttps://youtu.be/LgAUYJ_gglg\nBut! Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix does look kind of fun. There are Easter eggs, butts, and speed lines. There are some rainbows. It also looks like there’s going to be some Assassin’s Creed wrapped in there. Could be good. I’ve got no reason to believe otherwise.\nI mean, I would still prefer that Ubisoft just makes another dumb-fun game, but I suppose that might be asking too much. At least they didn’t describe the show as being “semi-open world.”\nCaptain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix is coming to Netflix this Fall.\nThe post Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix is a show coming to Netflix this Fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fortunately, the second trailer demonstrates the proper gameplay of this title, which gives us a bit more to chew on. Director Mournir Radi called the world of The Lost Crown a \"semi-open-world,\" which I still can't get over.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3qsC8T42Ag\nOf course, the most intriguing part of this trailer is the showcase of time-based powers reminiscent of the original Sands of Time.

          "description": "Sony brand not booking its flight to Cologne\nAs we reach the tail-end of Summer Game Fest 2023, already developers and publishers are preparing their itineraries for the next major show of the summer, Gamescom 2023, which will take place in Cologne, Germany later this summer — But it sees that one of the biggest publishers on the block, PlayStation, will not be in attendance at Koelnmesse come August.\nAccording to a report by German news outlet GamesMarkt, (and spotted by VGC), Sony Interactive Entertainment has confirmed that it will not be showing up in either a digital or physical capacity for the show, which will be the first in-person Gamescom event since 2019, before the continuing COVID-19 brought the curtain down on the whole industry. Preparing for these shows is a hugely expensive endeavor, but it's still surprising to see Sony may not be on deck this year.\nOf course, the publisher did just roll out over an hours' worth of trailers in a recent State of Play, and there is still Paris Games Week and the Tokyo Game Show to go before the year is out, so PlayStation is sure to put in a new appearance come fall, even if it is taking time out for the remainder of the summer.\nGamescom 2023 — with or without PlayStation — takes place at Koelnmesse, Germany between August 23-27. The event will kick off with Geoff Keighley's Opening Night Live showcase on August 22.\nThe post PlayStation is reportedly not making the trip to Gamescom appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Come on, let’s go star truckin’!\nRaw Fury has announced that they’re bringing Monster and Monster’s star-hauling game, Star Trucker, to PC in 2024.\nI know what you’re thinking, “Isn’t Elite Dangerous just another name for Star Trucker?” Yes! Except Star Trucker is a more literal version of that. It’s more like if you jammed Elite Dangerous into Euro Truck Simulator 2 and then removed all the superfluous bits. For example, I see no mention of space pirates or combat of any kind within the walls of this press release. Nor in the twangy trailer.\nhttps://youtu.be/0ByyuI-azZs\nWhat I do see is the kind of approach I love. There’s this slowly building philosophy in the sub-mainstream game development community where tactile gameplay is beginning to slide in. Specifically, when it comes to driving games, there’s a push to make you feel more like a person in a vehicle rather than the vehicle itself. That means having to get out and perform maintenance or take care of your meat-vessel needs. This is in contrast to games like Euro Truck Simulator 2, where you have no real existence outside of your truck.\nWe're star truckin' round the stars\nThe trailer doesn’t show off a lot of gameplay, but it does depict things like patching holes in your truck. It looks like you activate things within your truck by actually looking at them and interacting. Moreover, during the sequence where the player fixes the exterior of their space-truck, you get a glimpse of the interior, and it seems to be more than just a cockpit.\nThat’s more-or-less just speculation. What Star Trucker does promise is hauling jobs, goods of the legal and less-than-legal variety, and customization of your space-rig. There’s also a CB Radio that allows you to “interact with a fully voiced cast of characters for an authentic trucking experience.”\nPC is the only announced platform for Star Trucker, while the release window is for the wide-open road of 2024.\nThe post Star Trucker is assembling the space convoy in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This past weekend at the Microsoft Summer Game Fest showcase/conference, we got a brief look at what's next for Fallout 76: a new adventure set in Atlantic City (New Jersey).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZR25_y5XL4&t=122s\nBilled as \"coming soon\" (which no exact date or window in mind), the clip is presented in a sing-along format, showcasing old Fallout 76 content and gameplay before getting into the new stuff at the 1:30 mark. I should point out that this footage is extremely brief, as we only get a few panned shots of what's to come in the Atlantic City update: including a shot of a casino, a bit of the boardwalk, and an enemy roaming the streets. We've collated all of those shots in the gallery below.\nInfo is very slim on the Fallout 76 Atlantic City update\nBeyond the trailer, all the info we have is from the game's official blog:\n\"Prepare for high rollers and higher stakes when Fallout 76 embarks players on an all-new Expedition to Atlantic City – coming soon for all players! With so many ways to play, you too can answer the call of 76.\"\n\nThat's it! You can expect a mid-to-late Q3 release at the earliest, given the prior cadence of major content drops. Ideally, this update/expansion isn't a repeatable Pitt style expedition: but a full-on new zone to explore.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"386155,386157,386158,386159\"]\nThe post Fallout 76 is still chugging, heading to Atlantic City next appeared first on Destructoid.",

Because had I skipped the show, I likely wouldn't have learned about Parcel Corps.\nFrom developer Billy Goat Entertainment and publisher Secret Mode, Parcel Corps puts players in the shoes of a freelance bike messenger who must make their deliveries before time runs out. The game takes place on New Island where three delivery companies are just waiting to pay you the least amount of money legally possible to do your job. That's the gig economy for you, baby!\nWhile making deliveries is the name of the game, players can also pull off some sick tricks on the halfpipes and ramps scattered across the city's nine areas, terrify rooftop pigeons, and, if they're in the mood, overthrow a totalitarian government.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sso5T3ovzmE\nCheesy trailer aside, Parcel Corps certainly has my attention with its colorful world, inviting gameplay, and anti-capitalistic messaging.

That alone makes me want to play this just so I can knock that fucker down a few notches.\nLike a lot of the games revealed today, Parcel Corps will arrive in 2024 on an unspecified date.

I've seen plenty of productions of it during my near-40 years on this Earth, but I don't think I've ever seen the story tackled in a video game.\nPerhaps that's why Ebenezer and the Invisible World was the most amusingly confounded trailer at the PC Gaming Show. From Orbit Studio and Play on Worlds, Invisible World tells the story of what happens after the ghosts helped Scrooge become a new man. I'm not sure if Dickens ever planned for a sequel, but I have to imagine if he did write one, it wouldn't have had the geezer down-kicking bad guys or using the power of the ghost of Haley Hall to pass through ethereal gates.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmo07RJg2Aw\nI'm not going to say I'm sold on the idea of reinventing one of literature's most famous tales as a metroidvania, but it's certainly a lot more interesting than just turning into a horror game. Plus, the holiday setting is charming, and the hand-drawn environments are scrumptious.\nEbenezer and the Invisible World is in development for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

          "description": "Xbox gets ready to showcase what's ahead\nIt's been a busy weekend of streams, and today was one of the big ones. Microsoft took to the stage in Los Angeles for its dual-header of the Xbox Games Showcase 2023 and its Starfield Direct. The first half is all about Xbox, between its first-party and third-party offerings, while the latter puts the lens squarely on Bethesda's impending RPG.\nThe summer may be a little off this year without E3, but today's show felt strong to me. Maybe it's the sheer variety, from new originals to first-party reveals. Or maybe it's that, even with some leaks, Xbox managed to get a few moments of surprise. As far as trailer-bonanzas go, I feel like it was a good one. A lot of the games are aimed towards 2024, though.\nStill, with a big Cyberpunk update and the massi…",

I loved the art direction, the setting, and the character design; it checked a lot of boxes for me. I told myself I'd try to keep the game in mind, but that didn't happen. I forgot about it until I saw the debut trailer for the game in today's Xbox Game Showcase.\nFree from the awful Twitter video player, the game still looks outstanding and is once again checking all those same boxes for me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-3NsH82HA\nI don't want to get myself too hyped for it as that tends to bite me in the butt with indies.

A prime example of this is Clockwork Revolution, a new game from the creators of Wasteland.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDFuhaYxeMU\nIn a blog post by InXile Studio Head Brian Fargo, we fortunately find a few details to give this world some context. As the title might imply, Clockwork Revolution will focus heavily on time travel. Fargo promises both \"dynamic time-bending combat\" and a plot centered around the gimmick. It looks like players will find themselves traveling to the past and making choices that will affect the future in substantial ways.\nThe post notes the team is \"pushing roleplaying reactivity to new heights\" with this game, so we'll have to see how much player choice impacts the final product.\nThat said, don't expect to see Clockwork Revolution anytime soon. The post clarifies that the game is \"still early in development,\" and that this is just a sneak peak. The trailer says the game will \"come in due time,\" so we'll stay tuned to learn more.\nAt the very least, some of you may wind up with Clockwork Revolution whether you like it or not.

Cities Skylines 2 has gotten an actual in-game trailer and a release date for October 24th.\nOh, yeah. This is a good trailer. It shows off the upgraded visuals of Cities Skylines 2, and a UI which is a mix of familiar and new. There are exciting features like being able to build both roads of a divided highway at the same time. I don’t know how to make that sound exciting, but trust me, it’s amazing. It shows a number of other improved traffic-related upgrades. You can just make grids of roads now, but I hope you’re not an individual who just sticks to grid designs for cities. I expect better from you.\nhttps://youtu.be/QZW39Yml3a8\nBeyond that, the engine once again looks nicer, but absolutely familiar. However, if there’s one thing that gets my blood pumping, it’s weather effects. Cities Skylines had snow, but you were essentially just picking a snow-city map, and that was about it. Your city was just a snow-city. A brief moment in the trailer shows snow accumulating. Again, this might be something that a normal person doesn’t get, but it absolutely gets me excited.\nI thankfully don’t have to wait too long. Cities Skylines 2 is coming October 24, 2024.

The DLC is available to pre-order now on all platforms, priced at $29.99 or local equivalent.\nAnyone pre-ordering the Phantom Liberty DLC will receive a bonus item in the form of a snazzy muscle car, the Quadra Vigilante. This car will unlock at the start of the expansion and ensure that V is looking pretty damn ace as they whiz their way around Night City. The new DLC will open up a brand new district in the hazardous 'berg, and will also star Idris Elba as FIA agent Soloman Reed.\nThe Phantom Liberty expansion DLC was expected to arrive a little closer to Cyberpunk 2077's 2020 launch, but production was slowed as the developer instead focused on polishing the original release, which famously received one of the most notoriously disappointing launches (at least technically) in the modern gaming sphere. Cyberpunk 2077 has since launched on Gen9 platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is generally considered to be in a far cleaner, higher-quality state.\nCyberpunk 2077 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC launches September 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As part of this afternoon's Xbox Games Showcase, Atlus revealed its long-requested remake of one of the most iconic and beloved RPGs of all-time, in the form of Persona 3 Reload, which you have never heard of before.\nPersona 3 Reload is a full remake of the classic PS2 social-sim-cum-demon-catcher, which wowed western fans in 2006 and took the Shin Megami Tensei brand practically mainstream. The story concerns a party of school students who uncover a temporal anomaly known as \"The Dark Hour\". The students in question form the \"Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad\" (SEES), with the aim of getting to the root of the anomaly and the strange creatures that lay within.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIIPXA2A6cM&ab_channel=Xbox\nPersona 3 was praised for its vivid visual style, attractive and likable cast of characters, and wild soundtrack. The marriage of dungeon-crawler with supah-anime social sim was a huge hit, and would lead to greater success in sequels Persona 4 and Persona 5, as well as an array of multi-genre spin-offs.

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.\nYou can also check out a new trailer for the game below.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.",

The game lets players control Ezio (AC II), Connor (AC III), and Kassandra (AC: Odyssey) in first-person through an original story that lets players parkour, hide in the shadows, and assassinate targets in the more immersive avenue that VR provides. Check out the CG trailer below. \n\n\nWe next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay. Jade is the first title that lets the player build their own protagonist from scratch, and you can register now to join the game’s first playable beta.",

The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.\n\n\nThe game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. \nWe also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC.

The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.\nThe new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.\nAs Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. \n\n\nIn addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).",

          "description": "After years wallowing in purgatory, 2011's Shadow of the Damned is getting another shot in the limelight via a remaster. On top of that, developer Grasshopper Manufacture is holding its own E3-style presentation next week.\nShadows of the Damned was the product of a collaboration between Grasshopper's Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), who wrote the game, and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who served as a producer. It's a third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who must rescue his girlfriend after she's abducted by the forces of the underworld with the help of his trusty phallic-joke loving demon, Johnson. The game's bombastic, supernatural action and absurd sense of humor made it generally well-liked upon release (We scored it a 9.25 out of 10 in our review), but it has never been ported beyond its original platforms on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's about to change.\n\n\nThe humorous trailer doesn't reveal any details about the remaster, but we'll likely learn more at the inaugural Grasshopper Direct on June 14. The event celebrates the studios 25th anniversary and kicks off at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET, so fans in the U.S. will have to brew an extra cup of coffee if they want to catch the event live. \nAre you a fan of Shadows of the Damned or does this remaster entice you to give it a shot?

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

However, the game will still be playable for those who own it through at least the following year, meaning up to December 31, 2024.

A lenghty trailer gave us some good looks at its gameplay, story, as well as a much-anticipated release window. \nThe story sees Cloud and the gang explore beyond Midgar to stop Sephiroth’s plans, and we see looks at the grander Final Fantasy VII story, likely to be laden with new twists. In terms of new faces, get to see Elena join Reno and Rude in the Turks, and Yuffie, the fiery Wutai ninja introduced in the Intermission story expansion, officially joins the party. \n\n\nPerhaps the most surprising revelation is that Rebirth will come on two discs. Given how much storage a single Blu-ray can hold, that suggests that Rebirth could be a mammoth-sized experience, which is wild given that it’s only Part 2 of a planned trilogy of games. We also now know that Rebirth is coming in early 2024 exclusively to PlayStation 5.",

As you might expect, this mainly means he's beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. The trailer shows a variety of large-scale fights, as well as Kiryu's new fighting abilities, which include a rope-type weapon he can use to bring items and people closer to him.\nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nAs pointed out by Gematsu, Gaiden gameplay details actually leaked yesterday on the PlayStation Store. Here are some of the key details:\n\"Dynamically switch between the Yakuza and Agent fighting styles in visceral melee combat.\n\"With the Yakuza style, strike fear into enemies by unleashing wildly aggressive moves powered by Kiryu’s unparalleled strength and flair.\n\"Or up the ante with the Agent style by delivering blows with absolute speed and precision, while using an array of high-tech gadgets like electrified bind wires to stun enemies then send them flying.\n\"Strategically adapt to the situation and leverage both styles to dominate and destroy hordes of enemies.\"\n\"Whether you’re brawling in the secret Castle arena, singing a new karaoke song, enjoying a drink at the live-action cabaret club, or racing in the pocket circuit, the world offers a variety of immersive experiences.\n\"An intriguing informant named Akame also provides thrilling sub-missions, drawing you into an epic showdown that unfolds the more you explore and enjoy Sotenbori, Yokohama and the mysterious Castle.\"\nLike A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released on November 9, 2023.",

          "description": "Sick of losing cubes in Marvel Snap? This newest game mode might be the solution to your problems. Today during Summer Game Fest, Second Dinner's Chief Development Officer Ben Brode took to the stage to announce that Conquest, Marvel Snap's newest mode, will launch on June 13. The news was accompanied by a promotional skit featuring SungWon Cho, who you might recognize as Ratatoskr from God of War: Ragnarök. You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nConquest Mode works similarly to Marvel Snap's Battle Mode. Two players are matched up for a series of games, each with ten units of health. Instead of wagering cubes, the currency players use to gain levels in the standard ranked mode, Conquest will have players wagering health. Unlike Battle Mode, which ends as soon as one player runs out of health, Conquest has players progress through tiers of competition, requiring longer winning streaks the higher they get. As a reward for making it to the top, players will receive exclusive cosmetics.\n“It’s just insane how good players have gotten at Marvel Snap since we launched in the fall,\" Brode said in a press release. \"For our most competitive, high-skilled players, we wanted to give them the ultimate challenge with Conquest. Players can now find out who truly is the best of the best and worthy of ultimate Marvel Snap glory!! What’s also super cool about Conquest is that the Proving Grounds can double as a great way to try out new decks, as Conquest has no impact on a player's Marvel Snap season rank.\"\nMarvel Snap recently started its \"Spider-Versus\" season, which will introduce new cards such as Ghost-Spider, Spider-Ham, and Silk. The game is currently available on PC and Mobile devices and made it onto the list of our top ten games of 2022.",

That means tilling the land to grow crops, gathering resources by exploring, and decorating your homesteads both inside and out. You can farm alone or enlist help by inviting friends in online multiplayer (as well as locally on Switch).

While we didn't get any new gameplay footage, we got two new pieces of concept art featuring the game's main villains, Kraven and Venom.\nVenom was revealed in the original trailer for Spider-Man 2, but we didn't see anything more than his face at the very end. This art is our first look at Insomniac's take on the character. When asked about his identity, Intihar would only say that it was not Eddie Brock, leaving the man inside the symbiote a mystery. But if you've played 2018's Spider-Man, you've probably got a good guess as to who's inside. For the full interview, check out the video below.\n\n\nAdditionally, we got an official release date.

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. PS: we made a mistake in the Windows release; a 13.2.1 was pushed to address this issue. It is fully network compatible with 13.2, so no need to update unless you want to. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
