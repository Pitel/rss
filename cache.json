Moomoo milk, sodapops, slowpoke tails, and more recently curry mixes and sandwiches – there’s no end to the edible and drinkable in the Pokéworld.\nWe’ve even covered Pokéfood before on Nintendo Life, both reviewing Japan-exclusive actual donuts and ranking the ‘mons we’d find the tastiest. Those ancient Pokémon fans among us might even recall that during Ash, Brock, and Misty’s early adventures, they often dined on what they called donuts. These white-and-black triangle-shaped pastries were actually rice balls — onigiri — dubbed 'donuts' in the English version of the show as kids presumably wouldn’t know onigiri from fried dough.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Is that such a bad thing?\nThe ongoing drama surrounding Microsoft's planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard continues to surge. For anyone who might not be aware of what's going on, the Xbox giant moved to acquire the publisher of Call of Duty, Overwatch, Crash Bandicoot, and other major IP for an astonishing $68.7 billion. Sony, meanwhile, isn't too happy about the deal, stating its ongoing concerns about potentially losing Call of Duty to its primary competitor. As such, the deal is currently under close scrutiny from several regulators, including the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nIn a recently published document, Sony Interactive Entertainment put across a series of observations to potentially assist in its efforts to block the deal between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard from going through, and one observation in particular caught our attention. In a couple of choice paragraphs, Sony effectively states that Microsoft is trying to turn it into Nintendo, arguing that the latter has proved successful without the likes of Call of Duty.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Granted, there's a predetermined layout applied to the town that you're unable to manually alter, so your agency over its creation is ultimately quite limited, but it's still nevertheless an excellent and unique side-quest.\nYouTube creator Crossing Crafts has gone one - or rather several - steps further and recreated Tarrey Town in beautiful detail by using stir sticks, glue, and - as they say - pain.

          "description": "Physical release closely follows.\nAfter having its physical release pushed back from the pre-set date of 25th November, we began to worry whether adorable looking RPG The Outbound Ghost would make it to Switch in 2022. Fortunately, an announcement from publisher Digerati and developer Conradical Games has warmed out spirits, as it confirmed that the game will be coming to Switch in digital form on 1st December, before physical copies emerge the following day.\nLaunching on Steam earlier this year to a pretty positive reception, we have been looking forward to seeing this cute little ghosty make its way to Switch for a while now. The game is a tribute to Paper Mario, with 'hand-made' locations and characters, witty writing and timing-based combat - what's not to like?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now, as we have come to expect from Hello Games, more content will be soaring our way soon, this time in the form of the year's limited-time expeditions re-appearing on our radar.\nExpeditions have been a mainstay of No Man's Sky since they started in 2021. A way to give the game a progression-based twist, the four events which ran during 2022 (Exobiology, Blighted, Leviathan, Polestar) have provided cool rewards and a closer look at just how big this game actually is. Hello Games' announcement that these will be returning to the game means that those who played and missed out on certain elements before can dive back in, while those of us on Switch will be able to experience the expeditions for the first time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In a nutshell, you'll need to be able to hightail it to a nearby open town (by \"open\", this means one that doesn't contain a loading door) after you've caught the shiny.

Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed.

          "description": "I've known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life's calling. My eyesight's terrible, for one, and I guarantee I'd be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don't think I'd even make it through the doors at NASA. They'd take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game's story.\nThere's a good reason for this, though, and it's one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she's anything but. In fact, when she's climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home's little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game's gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It's a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers. \nRead more",

It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.\nMy history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it'll last in the long run and confirms that there's still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.\nRead more",

Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems.

          "description": "When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. \"Everything was a dive bar,\" Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. \"It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was.\" His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard (\"As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard\", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.\nBack in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. \"The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it,\" Popovich says.\nRead more",

What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn.

The Warzone 2.0 Trello board listing known issues with the game doesn’t show any mention of known invisibility bugs yet, so stay frosty.\r\n\n \nRead more",

What's remarkable about Valve's team shooter is how little its fundamentals have changed over those twenty years. The AWP and M4A1? Still pretty much how they were when I was first mishandling them in the Half-Life mod. \r\n\nWhich makes yesterday's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update pretty remarkable. The AWP's magazine size has been cut in half and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long range.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Games mostly don't do it justice at all, either making \"piracy\" shorthand for \"mindless omnicide for no reason\" or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.\nBuccaneers! isn't primarily a piracy game, but they're one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I'd call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier's Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It's probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.\nRead more",

I'm saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.\nSpider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac's first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It's a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it's still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it's shorter.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they're working on during tonight's PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It's called Jumplight Odyssey (or \"J-Lo\" for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it's a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto's seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. \nIn it, you play as Princess Euphora, who's on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It's not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I've seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.\nRead more",

Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. 'Aha!' I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.\nFor those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.\nRead more",

Both are incredibly good value after today's discounts, and well worth taking a look at if you're in the market for a monitor upgrade! \nRead more",

SteelSeries' PrismCaps are an awesome upgrade over your stock keycaps, offering high-quality PBT construction, backlit legends and a beautiful two-tone 'pudding cup' design that looks great, especially with an RGB keyboard. \nNormally a full keycap set of PrismCaps will cost you $30, but as an early Black Friday deal you can find these keycaps for 50% off - just $15. At that price, these are in impulse buy territory for me, as they'll provide an immediate uplift over your existing keycaps and last for decades.  \nRead more",

We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.\r\n\n\r\nStill, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've never really graduated from storing my clothes on the floor like I did when I was 16 (every 12 weeks or so I tidy them all away and then start the process again). It is cold, so I have a pink blanket that is my work chair blanket, which I have had for at least five years and I cannot remember washing. I store things using a cunning system of my own devising i.e. the cellotape has been behind the left monitor on my desk for months, so by the transitive property that is now Where The Cellotape Goes. If I put the cellotape somewhere more logical, like in a drawer for keeping things like cellotape, then I would forget where the cellotape is. \nThe area in and around my desk is a nonsensical melange of things, a place that would probably deal you +12 psychological damage if you approached without the necessary preparation.

To start, here's a trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBT2SP21f3Q\nOn the graphics side of things, consoles will get the option for a performance or graphics mode.

A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.\nThe stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.\nhttps://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1595462356230115329\nWhat's the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of \"action, gore, and zombies.\" Hopefully we get to see some details of what's in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.\nRising from the grave\nIt's at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it's been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.\n“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”\nMore delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It's just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.\nWe'll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.\nThe post A Dead Island 2 showcase is set for December 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.\nIn a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he's asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.\n\"I don't know man, that game is big,\" said Williams. \"I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn't count on it.\"\nWhile there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn't too surprising. God of War (2018) didn't receive any extra DLC.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfJ4Km46A-0\nPatience, boy\nI haven't rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it's a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I'd be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.\nRagnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.\nWhat could those projects be?

The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.\n\"We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. \"Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development.\"\nThis \"world-class AAA game\" is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team's strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title's release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.\nNetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.\nDespite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.\nThe post NetEase Games acquires minority stake in Polish studio Rebel Wolves appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn't the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company's right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.\n\"Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve,\" said Office Create at the time. \"Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.\n\"Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create's approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create's approval.\"\nFollowing this week's legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves.

          "description": "You've got a friend in me (in a few weeks)\nThe next update to the mouse-powered isekai Disney Dreamlight Valley is arriving at the start of next month. The Toy Story realm joins Disney Dreamlight Valley on December 6, 2022.\nThe new update will arrive on all platforms on December 6, adding the new realm and Toy Story leads Woody and Buzz to the game. Plus, there are some Toy Story cosmetics in store for Disney Dreamlight Valley players to collect.\nWe got a good look at what's in store for the new area in a recent trailer. It highlights what's in store for intrepid Dreamlight Valley players who wander into Andy's Room.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lStz8KPOHl8\nBuzz Lightyear definitely looks like Buzz Lightyear, but Woody has some wild energy to him. The animations are really moving, in a way that makes me think this cowboy will definitely jump-scare at least one player on a stream.\nThat said, I've really enjoyed the way Disney Dreamlight Valley reimagines some popular Disney characters. Mickey's entire storyline of being a sad wife guy and seeing ghosts around town was a spin I did not expect, and made me like the character a lot more than just a normal Mickey storyline would have.\nVenture into the valley\nDisney Dreamlight Valley launched into an early access version this year, and it seems to have had a warm reception. It's a little bit of Animal Crossing meets famous Disney characters, but the appeal makes a ton of sense. Slowly building up a town full of Disney mainstays and seeing them interact, as well as completing some chill quests for them, is an interesting premise that seems to have worked out.\nWe'll see what kind of energy Buzz and Woody bring to the neighborhood when they arrive in the valley on December 6.\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley gets its Toy Story realm in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The compendium features a small handful of shmups that jetted out of developer Telenet Japan in the early '90s, finding an audience on Sega Mega Drive and PC Engine.\nThe new collection is the spearhead of a project by Edia to archive the works of Telenet Japan, a developer/publisher that produced a huge library of games for the console era's formative years. From arcade adventures to platformers, beat-'em-ups to shmups, Telenet Japan would develop and/or publish titles for a wide variety of platforms including Sega Mega Drive, MSX, PC Engine, Game Boy, and the Sharp X68000.\n\nThe Telenet Shooting Collection will feature four titles in total: Sega Mega Drive releases Granada (1990) and Gaiares (1990), and PC Engine titles Avenger (1990) and Psychic Storm (1992). No details have been released in regards to any new modes or additional content, nor has a western localization been announced. The collection is set to launch in Japan on Nintendo Switch in the latter half of 2023.\nAdditionally, Edia has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Makuake to help fund the development and marketing of the title. With an achievable goal of around three million yen (around $22,000 USD), Edia hopes that the money can be put toward additional features, as well as marketing materials for the title's official release. With the archiving of gaming's earliest eras now more important than ever, this project is increasingly important and could bring some long M.I.A. releases to new audiences.\nIn related news, Cosmic Fantasy Collection will launch in Japan, December 15, on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Telenet Shooting Collection compiles some forgotten ’90s shmups appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cha cha real smooth\nAh, the \"Cha Cha Slide.\" A simple, groovy party song that somehow wormed its way into every elementary school gym class in America. There's truly nothing better than a choreographed song that just yells out the moves to you, because even someone with two left feet can make that work. The song is truly a staple of organized events, but thanks to a Call of Duty streamer with a sense of humor, the \"Cha Cha Slide\" has made its way into Warzone 2.0 in the most wholesome, hilarious way.\nI had almost completely forgotten the \"Cha Cha Slide\" even existed until I saw a video of @JhbTeam playing the song over his microphone in the Warzone proximity chat. As any reasonable person would do, a crowd of enemy players formed in front of him to participate in the greatest line dance known to man. It's surprising how well the \"Cha Cha Slide\" translates to Call of Duty, although I am a bit disappointed no one actually slid when the song instructs them to slide.\nhttps://twitter.com/JhbTeam/status/1594785851242090496\nAccording to JhbTeam, it took them a bunch of tries to get enemy players to stop shooting long enough to get in on the joke. I can absolutely say that whether or not someone is willing to do the \"Cha Cha Slide\" in Warzone is a litmus test for whether or not they would be my friend. All of these players passed the vibe check. You can even see that JhbTeam is receiving friend requests from the other players while conducting the group in the classic dance, so here's hoping that this will be the start of some beautiful friendships.\nAs much as I love CoD, I sometimes find that the series, and some of the people who play it, take themselves a bit too seriously sometimes. Seeing something like this is a great reminder that we're all out here to have fun, and getting a win is often less important than getting into the spirit of the game and sharing in a cool moment with others.\nThe post This Warzone player used proximity chat to do the “Cha Cha Slide” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Give us a Ring\nNintendo Japan has released a new trailer for its upcoming fantasy epic Fire Emblem Engage, which launches on Nintendo Switch in January of the new year. The new trailer focuses on the strategic gameplay of the RPG sequel — specifically the magical mechanic known as \"Emblem Rings\".\nThe Emblem Ring mechanic allows the protagonist to infuse their skills and abilities with the spirit of other Fire Emblem heroes, whose powers are harnessed within literal rings. Once activated, the Emblem Ring expands upon, boosts, or otherwise enhances certain abilities, as the protagonist takes on the skills and combat arts of their chosen Emblem Ring. In a fashion, it is similar to the Persona mechanic in the series of the same name — except instead of Pixie or Nekomata, you have Celica or Byleth.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIWPFmnu4Vk\nAs they grow alongside their chosen Fire Emblem rings, the protagonist will inherit weapons, skills, and spells from this roster of classic characters, while building up overdrive abilities and all-new ultimate attacks, defined by the classic characters you have chosen to grow alongside. Six rings are featured in this trailer (Sigurd, Celica, Corrin, Lyn, Byleth, and, of course, Marth.

EA Sports confirms it's aiming for a summer 2024 revival of its college football series.\nSpeaking to ESPN, EA Sports VP and general manager Daryl Holt said the timing is due to how much of an undertaking this will be.\n\"That's the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations,\" Holt told ESPN. \"And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We're trying to build a very immersive college football experience.\"\nPart of this involves use real college football players in the game. Before, using players' likeness in a new EA Sports college football seemed like a non-starter. But as Holt describes it, \"the road's open now, but it's still under construction.\"\nThis echoes some comments from July 2021 about the possibility of using real players in the virtual experience. An EA source told ESPN that players will be compensated if they appear in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTklaI3EAm0\nBack to school\nEA first announced back in February of 2021 that college football would be returning to the EA Sports fold.

The almost mythic puzzler will launch in the near future courtesy of, of all people, Hamster's Arcade Archives range.\nDeveloped by Arika, and originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master follows the typical ruleset of Alexey Pajitnov genre-defining classic, but offers up a staggering 999 levels of play and introduces the \"20G\" mechanic beloved by dedicated players. Essentially, this mechanic sees blocks appear directly on top of the wall, offering the player a split-second to effectively move them into place.\nCheck out the wild action in the classic run below, courtesy of YouTuber Sega-16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEzvyMI4I9I\nTetris: The Grand Master is recognized by the Tetris community's expert players and speedrunners — those who you see performing almost reality-breaking feats of organization at events such as Awesome Games Done Quick, (or alternately, my friend Jonster, whose own Tetris skills leave me utterly flabbergasted. Look how happy he is in this tweet!). While TGM would receive several readily available sequels, this Arcade Archives release will represent the original's first-ever home release outside of Japan, and as such is a major reckoning for Tetris players.\nNo date has been revealed for the title's launch but, as regular readers will be aware, we cover each and every Arcade Archives release right here on Destructoid, and have done so for many, many years.

          "description": "Ubi catalog to roll out on Valve platform once again\nFollowing on from recent rumors and speculation, publisher Ubisoft has confirmed that it will be rolling out its catalog of recent releases in a return to Valve's popular PC storefront, Steam. The lead title will be Viking adventure Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which will arrive on the Steam platform December 6.\n\"We're constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are, while providing a consistent player ecosystem through Ubisoft Connect,\" said Ubisoft in a statement to Eurogamer. \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions are among the Ubisoft titles that will be releasing on Steam.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eCw20F0zmA\nUbisoft had been regularly releasing its games on Steam since the platform's advent back in 2003, but chose to separate from the storefront in 2019 to publish its wares through its in-house Uplay service — and then later via Epic Games Store. Ubisoft's return to Steam was heralded by several database leaks spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, before the publisher finally confirmed its storefront comeback yesterday.\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla, originally launched in 2020, is getting set to receive its final DLC update — titled The Last Chapter. As such, this is a smart time for the game to make its Steam debut, allowing new players to pick up the epic adventure alongside all previously released DLC content. The next Assassin's Creed title, Mirage, is currently in development at Ubisoft.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Valhalla leads the charge as Ubisoft officially returns to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

This should come as no surprise, given Pokemon is the largest media franchise in the world and has over 25 years of history. Still, if you haven’t followed the series since its first generation, deciphering it can be overwhelming.\nThe mainline Pokemon series is classified by “generations.\" This is because many Pokemon games are virtually identical, save for a handful of differences or a few enhancements. For example, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are similar enough that only hardcore fans will play both. This can get especially confusing once you include remakes and rereleases of past Pokemon games.

          "description": "Fighting aliens in video games have been an important part of the medium since its inception. The very first video game, Space War, was about a war in space. Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.\nThe smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …",

          "description": "A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon \"Emblems,\" characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",
