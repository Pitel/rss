It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.\nI'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one.

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.\nThe biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue.

No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense.

It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.\nRead more",

It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a \"bogus\" phishing report, sent by \"AI-powered\" brand protection software.\nThe situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires.

He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me.

No, the Maw's penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.\n  \nRead more",

Everyone knows about ‘hardback’ and ‘softback’ books, but have you heard of the quickly discontinued ‘rice puddingback’? While hiring so many rice grain artists to transpose the blurbs in beautiful calligraphy made for an impressive spectacle, they were eventually banned after several fatal train slippage and/or smellage incidents. Ah well!  This week, it’s Charlene Putney, who’s been writing for games for over ten years, including bits for Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 3, NUTS, and Saltsea Chronicles!

          "description": "The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.\nIt stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate.

More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete.

That day is not today. Today there is only icy darkness and suffocation. Say \"hello\" and probably also \"AIEEEEBLubLBBLBLBL\" to Darkwater, a new co-op horror extraction game in which you brave the frigid oceans of an alien moon.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.\nI’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.\n  \nRead more",

The faction has left the galactic map, where they'll never be seen again. Right?\n\n\nAfter months of teases, rumors, and community-led scuttlebutt surrounding it, the Illuminate faction finally appeared in Helldivers 2 and was just as quickly shown the door. The weekend saw 150K Helldivers 2 players on Steam fighting the Illuminate campaign on Calypso. After three days, Helldivers won the campaign with a margin of only 0.1%. \n\n\n\n\nAfter reclaiming the planet, the Illuminate disappeared. Granted, it wasn't exactly easy to kick the squids back to the void. The fight was a bit too close, claiming 38 million divers. Regardless, Super Earth made one hell of a statement. \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Super Erf\n\n\nHelldivers 2 players are gluttons for punishment, and many are asking about the next deadly wave. I mean, Calypso was liberated so quickly that some were a bit disappointed. By that, I don't mean they weren't fun to fight. They were. But it just happened so fast. I hoped to get more games in this weekend, but the campaign was over before I realized it. I know I'm not the only one.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the Illuminate will stage a comeback. The first battle certainly feels like the alien faction was testing the waters. Helldivers 2 players will certainly see the Illuminate return for a bigger swing, but next time they'll have fresh wheels. Fast Recon Vehicles will be available to purchase as a new Stratagem within the next few days. The latest Warbond, Urban Legends, comes with a new vehicle pattern (skin) for when that happens. \n\n\nUntil then, Helldivers 2 players will have to be patient some more.

I won't put it here, and I ask that you don't go looking for it, either. Just trust me when I say that it does set up some pretty cool things for the future of the series. I believe even Eggman would agree with me on this one.\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago, after the release of the original Sonic trailer — the one with the weird-looking Sonic — no one could have predicted the Sonic movie series to be the one that would break the video game adaptation curse. Not only was the original Sonic movie way more fun that it needed to be, it spawned a trilogy that seemingly keeps on getting better with each installment. \n\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 3 opens on December 20.\n\n\n\nThe post Beware: Massive Sonic 3 spoilers are out, including the post credits scene appeared first on Destructoid.",

While this may seem insignificant at first, his appearance may be our first hint that Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, and other Square Enix properties are going to join this wonderful adventure very soon.\n\n\n\n\nSince it currently owns the Gex series, Square Enix acknowledged Astro Bot on its official social media accounts for the first time since the game's initial release. This is particularly intriguing, because Astro Bot lacks any cameos of characters from Square's biggest IPs, like Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, or Dragon Quest, and gamers have been asking Team ASOBI to add them in for months. \n\n\nAnd now, not only has Square Enix celebrated Gex's inclusion, but Team ASOBI even responded by …",

          "description": "Brawl Stars offers a variety of Assassin types to choose from, including the elite Lily. However, like many characters, it's crucial to equip suitable abilities to give them much more power. In this guide, we'll show you the best Lily build to use in Brawl Stars.\n\n\nWhat is the best build for Lily in Brawl Stars?\n\n\nTo get the best Lily build in Brawl Stars, choose the following techniques:\n\n\n\nGadget: Vanish\n\n\nGear: Shield\n\n\nStar Power: Spiky\n\n\nGear 2: Gadget Charge\n\n\n\nLily's Vanish ability may be the best Gadget in Brawl Stars, allowing you to vanish to the Shadow Realm for three seconds. It's useful for quick getaways or when you want to perform a sneak attack. As for the Star Power, go with Spiky, granting 530 more damage after teleporting. Although the other Star Power, Vigilance, does provide a nice speed boost, I always like enhancing damage rates for quicker takedowns.\n\n\nIf you want to teleport, unleash Lily's Flourish Super by throwing a seed in a straight line. Once it hits an enemy, you'll teleport shortly after, perfect for the Spiky Star Power.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFor Gadgets, you can attach the Shield to gain 900 extra health, which regenerates every 10 seconds. Lily's default build isn't exactly the best health-wise, so using a Gadget like this can help prolong her survivability. Besides the Shield, utilize the Gadget Charge for another shot at the Vanish ability. Since it's an exceptional skill, you will want to use it any chance you get.\n\n\nAs an Assassin Brawler, Lily's strength lies in your approach. Avoiding direct confrontation initially, you can leverage her teleport and Vanish ability to execute sneak attacks with finesse. This strategic use of her abilities puts you in control of the battlefield, allowing you to dictate the pace of the game. Additionally, if you want to see more best-of builds, check out our guides on Surge and Kenji. \n\nThe post Best Lily build in Brawl Stars appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're a Final Fantasy 14 player who has been hoping for a nice Christmas present, the Snowstreamer mount can be unlocked as part of the new Twitch Support-A-Streamer Campaign event.\n\n\nThis is a really unique opportunity for both the players and those who stream the game, and it's part of Twitch's partnership with the game. Its launch coincides with the Starlight Celebration event, and there's never been a better time to watch the gameplay content on Twitch. Let's take a look at how you can unlock this unique mount and how long it will be available.\n\n\nHow to get the Snowstreamer mount in Final Fantasy 14\n\n\nFor starters, you'll need a Twitch account, so go and create one (or login to your existing account). Next, start watching a Twitch Partnered streamer or one affiliated with the game. If you don't have anyone in mind, just search using 'Final Fantasy XIV Online'.\n\n\nOnce you start watching the streams, the next task is to gift three subscriptions of any tier to the subscribers. The cheapest option is to go for a Tier One subscription, and yes, the mount isn't technically available for free.\n\n\nThere are some freedoms - you don't have to buy and gift the three subscriptions all at once. The subscriptions can also be of different tiers. Just make sure that the purchase and gifting take place till the Twitch Support-A-Streamer Campaign Event is live. Otherwise, it won't count. The event is available till December 31, 2024, and a code will be available in your inbox once you've sent all three gifts.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've got the code, log in to your Final Fantasy 14 Mog Station website with your Square Enix account. Make sure that it's tied with your main in-game account in case you have multiple ones before redeeming the code. Once redeemed, you'll get the rewards via the Moogle Mail in the game. If you find it missing, make sure to restart the game once.\n\nThe post How to unlock the Snowstreamer Mount in Final Fantasy 14 (Twitch Support-A-Streamer Campaign Event) appeared first on Destructoid.",

This error usually pops up when there’s a problem with connecting to the game servers or something on your end isn’t working right. \n\n\nLuckily, there are a few things you can try to fix things and get back into the game. Here are all the possible fixes for the lobby not found error in Black Ops 6.\n\n\nAll possible fixes for Black Ops 6 lobby not found error (2901)\n\n\nTurn on the crossplay from the settings\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIf you are a console user, then you should definitely turn on the crossplay so that you can match up with more users in the game. By default, it is on, but if you have turned it off, then you should consider turning it back on. In case you don’t know where the crossplay settings are, here are the steps for it:\n\n\n\nStep 1: Open the Black Ops 6.\n\n\nStep 2: Now open the menu and head to the settings.\n\n\nStep 3: Once the settings are opened, go to Accounts & Network and there you can find the crossplay settings.\n\n\n\nRestart the game\n\n\nI know it sounds basic, but you can restart the game as it can sometimes clear up any temporary issues causing the error.\n\n\nUpdate the game\n\n\nMake sure that you have installed the latest patch. Sometimes this error happens if you are running an outdated version of the game.\n\n\nReinstall the game\n\n\nIf none of the above fixes work, then you should reinstall the game. It is a last resort, but it may fix any deeper issues with corrupted files. However, I would recommend waiting for a developer announcement regarding this error.\n\nThe post Black Ops 6 lobby not found error (2901): All possible fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Precision is a key factor when taking the field in Marvel Rivals, as one misclick can lead to your — and in the worst-case scenario — your team's demise. But what can you do when, unfortunately for many players, one default setting seems to be making that a common occurrence? Here's how to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals, as well as what exactly the setting does.\n\n\nHow to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals\n\n\nAs there's currently no way to turn off the setting from within the game, the only sure way to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals requires you to head straight to its files. You can do that by first heading to AppData\\Local\\Marvel. Once there, head to Safe, Config, and then to Windows before doing the following:\n\n\n\nSelect GameUserSettings\n\n\nOpen the file\n\n\nAdd the following lines to the file as shown below. Make sure to add them at the end to avoid any disruptions.\n\n[/script/engine.inputsettings]\n\n\nbEnableMouseSmoothing=False\n\n\nbViewAccelerationEnabled=False\n\n\n\n\nClose the file after making sure your changes are saved and then boot Marvel Rivals.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that although disabling the feature has yet to be pinpointed as the main cause for any ban, the way you cannot do so in-game can open you up for it. So make sure to take your time if you are not 100% sure.\n\n\nHow Does Mouse Acceleration Work?\n\n\nTrue to its name, Mouse Acceleration is a feature present in most modern games that boosts the range in which your cursor will move based on the speed at which you move your mouse. That can then lead to a huge decrease in precision, especially when in high-stakes situations, where having the same movement yield different results is never a good thing.\n\n\nNow that you know how to disable mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals, I also highly recommend checking out the best settings for max FPS in the game, so that you can further tune in your experience as you climb the ranks.\n\nThe post How to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals appeared first on Destructoid.",
