For those who missed it, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition flew over to Switch last month as either a bundle in and of itself or as an add-on purchase for those who already owned the game, and some players were disappointed to experience the title occasionally drop to 15-20fps in certain areas.\nWe didn't run into any performance issues in our review of the Anniversary Edition, but others were not so lucky.

A shame, as Oddworld, with its Mudokon slaves, the half-mechanical Sligs, and industrialist Glukkons, is a place we enjoy spending time in – even if it’s a little depressing and grotesque. The most recent entry, 2021’s Oddworld: Soulstorm, came as a reimagined version of 1998’s Abe’s Exoddus on PS1. Now, Soulstorm has arrived on Switch with a handful of improvements.\nOur sister website Push Square enjoyed Soulstorm about as much as antagonist Molluck the Glukkon likes our protagonist Abe – which, if you’re unfamiliar with Oddworld, is not very much. Bugs, clunky gameplay, and a lack of a fart button were among its issues, yet the Switch’s Oddtimized Edition promises to fix some of these issues, particularly the AI. The good news for Oddworld fans is that this promise has been fulfilled in some key areas. The bad news is that significant issues still abound.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We know that Kirby games can get wild with their lore, but Dream Buffet certainly isn't the first slice of the pie we'd think of when considering which Kirby games to adapt into a novel. But it's getting one. A game where you roll around and try to eat as many sweet treats as possible is getting a novel — not a cookbook! As an aside, we'd love a Kirby cookbook, but let's get down to business here — why Kirby's Dream Buffet?

In short, everything you could hope for if you like to just kick back and reel in a few fishies.\nWhat we can't quite get over, however, is just how similar it looks to Animal Crossing, at least in terms of aesthetics. Just look at those characters! They look like they've been plucked straight out of a bunch of Animal Crossing villages and dropped into Ace Angler.

This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating.

As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. \nAfter Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.\nRead more",

The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I've put together a list of my favourite zombie games.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It wasn't a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.\nThis was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.\n Read more",

          "description": "Horror games are usually a bit too scary for me to play alone. I actually barely manage to play them at all, though not for lack of trying. Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.\nIf you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you're looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam's done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.\nRead more",

This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won't like. I don't want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don't want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).\nAs it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I'm not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I'd sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn't played it for a while. Maybe it wasn't how I remembered. Maybe I'd changed, you know?\nRead more",

It's like, it's a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”\r\n\n\r\nTo Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it's just outlasted everything else.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.\nTrying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.\nRead more",

Over the course of it all, though, there's been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I've often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.\nI was beginning to think I'd lost the capacity to feel anything at all.

It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don't steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.\nThis puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven't played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you're missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, \"Yes\". The long answer is, \"Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably\".\nRead more",

Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. \r\n\n\r\nIt didn't help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady's trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I've been banging my head against all week. It's an uphill fort siege where you're facing off against an evil necromancer who's shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone's mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you've just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. \nTactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it's clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you'd learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I'm still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn's opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.\nRead more",

          "description": "About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.\r\n\n\r\nI was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”.

          "description": "As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We're all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It's very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...\nRead more",

          "description": "Hello folks. Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I'm sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We're still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I'd imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I'll keep you posted as soon as we've got more to share on it.\nThings that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year's list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I'm looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won't want to miss it.\nRead more",

They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?\nTurns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they'll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.\nRead more",

          "description": "Collectible card game Marvel Snap has been released into early access on Steam as a free to play download. Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.\nYou can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.\nRead more",

Well, it's because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a.

Many have compared it to Silent Hill 2 for that reason and many others, but for me, the ways that it's about internal conflict have always felt more unintentional than that.\nThroughout the game, the titular Mr. A.

Likewise, the game's Switch port is technically much, much worse than anyone would have expected.  When it comes to stuff like polygon count, pop-up, frame rate, and just a general sense of jank, this is one of the least polished-looking modern games from a AAA studio I've ever seen.

In a new blog, BioWare confirms Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has completed the Alpha milestone.\nWhat this means, effectively, is that Dreadwolf is currently playable from start to finish. This doesn't mean the work's done quite yet, though.\nIn a new blog, BioWare general manager Gary McKay says the team is now looking at the narrative cohesion.\n\"We can take the story we’ve written and see if we’re expressing it well through the characters, dialogue, cinematics, and ultimately, the player’s journey,\" said McKay. \"Now that we have the ability to do a complete playthrough, we can iterate and polish on the things that matter most to our fans.\"\nDragon Age: Dreadwolf is heading to a few new locales. Notably, this includes one fans have heard about more than a few times: the Tevinter Imperium. Today's blog confirms players will visit Minrathous, the heart of the Tevinter empire.\nMcKay continues on to say that the Dreadwolf team wants to \"continue being transparent\" with fans about development, and keep people up-to-date. So far, the studio has released a few development updates this year. One slapped the official subtitle on Dreadwolf. And another teased some codex entries that are in store.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw3lrXlti-8\nThe Dreadwolf rises\nThe next installment of Dragon Age was first teased at The Game Awards in 2018. Since then, BioWare's been working on it, going through some big shifts in the process.\nWhile we've seen some teases, we've still had yet to see a full look at what's in store for the Dragon Age universe. Hopefully, with such a big milestone passed, BioWare will cast more light on the Dread Wolf's plans soon.\nThe post Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has passed its alpha milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new remaster has an expected Japanese launch date of March 2023.\nR-Type Final 3 Evolved — revealed in the latest issue of Japanese publication Famitsu — is a revamped edition of the 2021 release R-Type Final 2, making the initial title of that game even more ironic than it already was. While details are incredibly slim at this stage, Famitsu reports that Final 3 Evolved will feature improved visuals, online multiplayer lobbies, a selection of mini-games, and an impressive 100 total ships as well as seven all-new stages, making this one of the most feature-packed releases in the iconic Irem franchise.\nIn addition, Final 3 Evolved will utilize support for the upcoming PSVR2 hardware, allowing players to be immersed in The Bydo Empire battle like never before. I personally cannot wait until the famous boss character Dobkeratops is quite literally assaulting my eyeballs with their eyeballs. While no western localization was announced, such a release remains highly likely, given the appearance of previous titles on North American and European shores.

But there will be a wait for a more elaborate photo mode in God of War Ragnarok, it seems.\nThe studio also recently released a combat breakdown, showing off some of the enemies Kratos and Atreus will face.

But Sony games have been historically good at providing elaborate photo mode options, so a little extra time's worth the wait for a good tool.\nThe game's gold and the date is set.

Having personally played a chunk of it, it certainly has some cool ideas, but isn't really the series that it would grow into with its sequels.\nA rermake of the original certainly seems like an intriguing prospect. No more details were shared today on when this might arrive. But hearing it will also utilize the tools for the next Witcher trilogy is interesting.\nThere's more in development at CD Projekt, too. The aforementioned new trilogy for The Witcher is one part, as is a new Witcher project from The Molasses Flood. And on the more futuristic side of things, CD Projekt is also working on the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077.\nThe post CD Projekt announces a remake of The Witcher built in Unreal Engine 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yep, it's a new Pokemon dog.\n\nThanks to some post-video info dumps, we know that it's a ghost-type Pokemon named Greavard, and that it seems to resemble a design that's a cross between Litwick and a dog.

Today, the studio laid out its plans for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous' Season 2 Pass, which will have three new pieces of DLC for the RPG.\nIn a video today, creative director Alexander Mishulin discusses the upcoming DLC. Owlcat put a survey in the field, and the studio says it got over 30,000 responses on what players want from more Wrath of the Righteous.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-fkebaHP9g\nThe result? This set of three DLC, currently labelled DLC 4, 5, and 6. Here's the rundown of each.\nPathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Season 2 Pass DLC\nDLC #4: A new companion joins the party, showcasing the new playable class for the DLC: the ever-changing Shifter. They're physical brawlers who take on bestial aspects. New love may even await.\nDLC #5: A standalone campaign that picks up from where Through the Ashes, a previous self-contained mini-campaign, left off. It offers a six-to-seven hour independent campaign, featuring a regular group of adventurers. And once you're done, a whole new dungeon in the main campaign will be available to explore.\nDLC #6: The Knight Commander and crew return to Kenabres for some unfinished business: actual rest and relaxation. A new festival is in the works, and there's plenty of opportunities to hang out with companions and your loved one. Though, you might want to keep an eye out for secret developments.\nThe Season 2 Pass for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous will go for $29.99, and is available to pre-order for PC players now. It doesn't look like a release plan has been set out yet for the new content.\nOwlcat's Wrath of the Righteous recently launched onto consoles, which also upgraded the PC version to the Enhanced Edition. And even with another RPG in the oven, it's nice to see Owlcat continuing to bulk out an already sizable RPG offering.\nThe post Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Season Pass 2 plans detailed appeared first on Destructoid.",

For Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, World's Edge has a date set for January 31, 2023. Age of Empires IV, meanwhile, will aim for Xbox consoles later in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cZTqd6BEIY\nIn an Xbox Wire post, World's Edge confirms that the team has been specifically working on the controller experience. The team is specifically crafting a tutorial for controller input, paired with a new user experience.\nA new game AI is also included, which the team says helps make resource management \"efficient and intuitive.\"\nIf controller isn't your thing though, keyboard and mouse inputs will be supported in the Xbox versions.\nKeep it on the down-wololo\nThe Age of Empires II Xbox release will include all the Definitive Edition content since 2019. Alongside the DLC that adds new campaigns and civilizations, there have also been tons of updates over the years.\nAccording to World's Edge, the versions will also have optional cross-play. This will let PC and Xbox players raise armies against each other, and the team is also aiming to bring AOE to Xbox cloud gaming. So yes, you will be able to lead a war elephant charge on the go at some point in the future.\nMore is on the way too, as Age of Mythology Retold is in production.

Concept art like this not only gives the developers details for making assets, they help set the look, feel and tone of the world players are about to inhabit.\"\n\nIn a small series of \"never-before-released\" concept art, we got to see a Scorchbeast, as well as the emergence from Vault 76, a look at The Pitt, and some environmental designs. The last piece, a collage of life in a vault, looks lovely. The blog concludes with a link to Adam Adamowicz's concept art gallery on Flickr, who provided a lot of the artistry for Fallout 3.\nWhile Fallout 76 has made big strides since its tumultuous launch, this concept art really showcases how much potential an Appalachian fully-fledged, kept-in-the-oven-until-it-was-done new Fallout could have been. It could take a while, but I hope that Fallout 76 isn't the last we've seen of this region. I guess there's always an opportunity for DLC in some far future Fallout iteration.\n[gallery columns=\"6\" link=\"file\" ids=\"348162,348163,348164,348165,348166,348167\"]\nThe post Bethesda shows off Fallout 76 concept art for the series’ anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was originally set for a 2022 release, until it got pushed back alongside another Bethesda project, Starfield.\nWe've still seen some glimpses and heard from the developers about what, exactly, Redfall is shaping up to be. It looks to be a first-person, co-op experience where four different characters have to take on the vampiric infestation of Redfall.\nEach character brings their own special weapons to the party.

          "description": "Old school in a new era\nWhen I first heard that Gungrave was coming back with not one, but two projects, I was in shock. This is a series that felt buried roughly two decades ago after Gungrave: Overdose on the PS2, but nonetheless we got a so-so VR adaptation, and very soon: Gungrave GORE.\nWe had a chance to play a preview build, and it feels like a blast from the past (in ways that will both delight and disappoint).\n\nOne thing I swiftly noticed after starting up Gungrave GORE is how much it asks you to already be somewhat invested in the lore. The quick intro was partially incomprehensible for newcomers, with a lot of exposition required, and less emotional resonance. What you mostly need to know is that anti-hero Grave is trying to kill the Ravenclan, led by four eccentric bosses who, i…",

          "description": "A battle for every area\nBandai Namco Entertainment has put out a new gameplay showcase for One Piece Odyssey, where we get a good glimpse of how the Straw Hat Pirates fight their turn-based RPG battles.\nBefore the fighting starts, we do get a look at the locale for the new adventure. One Piece Odyssey follows Monkey D. Luffy and the crew in a journey after they're shipwrecked at sea.\nIn the trailer today, we see the city of Alabasta and some of the locales the pirates will run through. Each character has an overworld ability, allowing them to access certain areas or take advantage of certain resources. From being stretchy or handy with a slingshot to just being small, everyone has their own talent for navigating the island.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcBzN-BymKg\nAll's fair in turn-based battles\nOnce the fighting starts, the crew dukes it out in a traditional RPG style. It's got a traditional vibe to it, with a little bit of One Piece style.\nIt looks like one of Odyssey's battle mechanics is the scramble area battle, where characters are placed in different zones to duke it out. Some characters are able to attack other areas from long-range, and it looks like fighters can also move from one area to another one their own is clear.\n\nBasically, an all-out brawl. But with type effectiveness and other factors in play, it seems like an interesting battle system that could make for fun combat encounters. I dig the idea of the crew getting split and having to fight their way back together. Plus, there are some conditions called Dramatic Scenes that give extra rewards for clearing them.\nI'm not a huge One Piece fan, but this look at the battle set-up has me intrigued. We'll see how Luffy and the crew's battles turn out in this new RPG when One Piece Odyssey launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 13, 2023.\nThe post One Piece Odyssey highlights its battles and overworld actions in new gameplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein's Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25. \nZomnics, monsters, witches, oh my! 😱#Overwatch2 Halloween Terror festivities begin Oct 25! pic.twitter.com/PvDSWmn0k0\nOctober 24, 2022\n\"Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator,\" a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. \"Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o'-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein's Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022.\" \nHalloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you'll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). \nAlongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review. \nAre you going to check out Halloween Terror this year?

          "description": "PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",

You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins.

The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita.

          "description": "To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. \nThe video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. \n\n\nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.\nDeveloper Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here.

The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.\nIn addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor.

Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.\n\n\nHere are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). \nWe scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: \n\"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.\"",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon.

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.",
