While Fashion Dreamer is not technically part of the Style Savvy family (known as 'Style Boutique' in Europe), it offers fans of those DS and 3DS games an opportunity to take their fashion expertise to Nintendo Switch.\nUnfortunately, Fashion Dreamer’s gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. At the beginning, we are welcomed into a virtual world called Eve, where we play as an influencer putting together outfits for NPCs and even other players if utilizing the online mode. The majority of the game is spent creating outfits, called 'look-its,' for characters that are spaced out across a small map, called a 'cocoon.' Each character wants their outfit to meet specific criteria, like featuring a certain color, including a clothing item such as a jacket, or having a particular vibe such as being “cool” or “unique.”\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The deck/city-building elements bring to mind classics like Slay the Spire and SimCity, and the emphasis on competition appears to add some humour and spice to the cosy aesthetic, something we've seen plenty of over the past few years.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

          "description": "When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since it's starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won't be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.\nIn the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you're a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.\nRead more",

One of the early replies was an \"ummm actually,\" pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded \"I'm one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that's not America\". I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach \"Zach Gage\" Gage.\nPuzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.\nRead more",

Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.\r\n\n\r\nOver the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.\r\n\nI headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?\r\n\n \nRead more",

In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. \nChunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.\nRead more",

This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.\r\n\n\r\nBut such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.\nI want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn't played The Tartarus Key already I'd be playing that, is what I'm saying. But the other day I played the demo for An English Haunting and it's exactly what I want.

All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow \"THE KING FISH\" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.\r\n\n\r\nPlus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo.

It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it. \nRead more",

I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.\nUsing a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.\nRead more",

          "description": "What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. \r\n\nYet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means. \r\n\n \nRead more",

You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won't give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. \nThis leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles. \nRead more",

I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. \nAlan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.\nRead more",

The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.\nRead more",

It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly?

I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.\nIn contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.\nRead more",

Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. \r\n\n\r\nI played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a \"sleeping old one below\". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fresh from the release of Alan Wake 2 - and apparently with a view to driving me nuts, because I haven't had a chance to play Alan Wake 2 yet - Remedy have shared some titbits about future projects. These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing \"good progress\", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.\nFurther afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that \"crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy\" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Movie Games and Vaporware have released the neon-soaked FPS Beyond Sunset into Steam Early Access today. It’s expected to stay there for six months before its full release.\n\n\nBeyond Sunset is part of an oncoming wave of first-person shooters built in the GZDoom Engine (an expanded source port of the engine that 1993’s Doom was built on), including Supplice and Selaco. It bills itself as a cyberpunk shooter with “a rich story and RPG elements.” You play as a woman with incredible abilities and no memory. Another woman promises to give your memories back if you kick some ass.\n\n\nI’m so tired of amnesiac protagonists. But aside from that, Beyond Sunset has lived on my wishlist for a while now, so I’m definitely going to check it out. It looks pretty fab with its lo-fi aesthetics injected with neon. I love raycasting. I deal with 3D constantly, and 2D games are rife in the indie and small-budget spheres, so I appreciate it when a game gives me 2.5D.\n\n\n\n\nThe RPG elements include side-quests and ability upgrades. It also features a soundtrack provided by Karl Vincent, who is touted as a “synthwave legend.” I’m going to have to take their word for it. Beyond Sunset also touts its modability, which I think is sort of a given considering its open-source engine.\n\n\nBeyond Sunset is available now in Steam Early Access. Vaporware is planning to have its full release in six months. The Early Access FAQ states that the current state of the game is “mostly finished – only minor tweaks and polishes are left.”\n\nThe post GZDoom FPS Beyond Sunset begins its Early Access stint today appeared first on Destructoid.",

The original story follows after the below tweet.]\n\n\n\n\nBloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that a Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement could be coming as early as this week, according to his sources. \n\n\nSchreier's sources also tell him that a trailer is scheduled for December, to coincide with Rockstar's 25th anniversary. As one of the most anticipated games, anticipation is high for Rockstar to finally unveil the next chapter of the massive franchise.\n\n\nFor years there has been a flood of GTA 6 rumors, with nearly all proving to be false. However, due to Schreier's track record, this claim holds a little more weight. Schreier had also previously reported that the upcoming game will feature a Latina protagonist which aligned with what we eventually saw in the colossal 2022 leak.\n\n\nImage via Rockstar.\n\n\nThe long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI\n\n\nThe gap between GTA 5 and its successor is the biggest in the franchise, with the game being originally released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013. During this time, it's had several re-releases, including a remaster for current-gen consoles. We got our first official mention of the successor in February 2022, and since then, reports from Schreier have claimed that we'll be heading back to Vice City in the next installment. \n\n\nIt is hard to predict what the upcoming game will look and feel like, as there have been significant changes at Rockstar since GTA 5. Most notably, Dan Houser has left the studio, and there have also been reports of a cultural change at the studio as it aims to shed its old fratboy ways. \n\n\nPrior reports claim that the upcoming game could launch in 2025, though we will have to wait for official word from Rockstar before marking our calendars. \n\nThe post GTA VI announcement coming in December, Rockstar says appeared first on Destructoid.",

There were no robot voices.\n\n\nBerzerk was a 1980 arcade title, which means it existed before good graphics were invented. While something like Pac-Man could generally be considered a better game, Berzerk had one thing going for it: the robots talked. They’d draw from a series of words and phrases that would get pasted together into taunts. Things like “Chicken! Fight like a robot!” or “Get the humanoid!” Imagination was leaned on to fill in a lot of graphical blanks in those days, and having the robots converse with each other and actively taunt the player really helped get you in the headspace.\n\n\nIf there are no robot voices, what are we even doing here?\n\n\n\n\nSo, I asked the PR person representing Sneakybox and Atari about it.

          "description": "The Switch has had a long and successful lifespan, and Nintendo isn't ready to move on from the hybrid console just yet.\n\n\nWith over 130 million units of the console sold, it's understandable why the company would not want to step away so quickly. Nintendo notes that the Switch will turn 8 years old in March 2024, but this won't mark the end of the console's life. Instead, the company will continue to develop new titles for it without being bound by traditional platform cycles, according to Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa.\n\n\nCompared to current-gen consoles, the Switch remains woefully underpowered. Despite this, it continues to sell like hotcakes, with it moving 132.46 million units globally. Furukawa's comments suggest that even if a Switch successor comes next year or in 2025, we'll still be getting games for the current hybrid console. \n\n\nThere are a few ways to interpret the comments. They could be an indication that the next generation will live alongside the Switch. The comments also reveal that Nintendo believes the hybrid console has a lot more to give.\n\n\nWe also get some updates on some of Nintendo's most profitable franchises. Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold 4.3 million copies within two weeks of launch, making it the best-performing Super Mario title. The game has managed to reach these heights with some help from the Super Mario Bros. Movie which has boosted the IP's popularity.\n\nThe post Despite Switch’s age, Nintendo intends to “continue to develop new titles without being bound by previous platform lifecycles” appeared first on Destructoid.",

The nominations reveal for The Game Awards, happening on December 7, will occur on Monday, November 13, with tickets available now.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Geoff's tweet, over 30 categories will be announced, including the highly-anticipated Game of the Year. This year has seen many acclaimed games, with titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kigndom, Baldur's Gate III, and Alan Wake 2 making big waves. Last year, the Game of the Year went to FromSoftware's Elden Ring. It'll be interesting to see what gets nominated this year, as well as what dark horses and snubs may appear, much like years past.\n\n\nFor those who want to experience the show in-person, tickets are now available for purchase. The event will take place at the Peacock Theater. Previous years had the show at Microsoft Theater, but no reason was given for the new location. Ticket prices range from $81 to $181, depending on where you choose to sit in the Orchestra section.\n\n\nStarting in 2014, The Game Awards, created by Geoff Keighley, is in its 10th year. While the event did exist prior in the form of 2013's VGX and Spike Video Game Awards, the show was a little loose with its presentation. In years since, The Game Awards have become a bit more prestigious, and now loosely resembles other music and movie award shows. \n\n\nStill, expect many big announcements, much like years prior. Famous announcements in the past include Xbox Series X, Death Stranding 2, and Joker from Persona 5 in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nThe post Nominations for The Game Awards 2023 coming November 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After nearly two years toiling away in the Early Access mines, developer Stray Bombay has announced that The Anacrusis officially launches this December. \n\n\nThe Left 4 Dead-like has been tweaked and patched 53 times since it entered Early Access. More than a million players have tested the game and seem to like what they've experienced. The Anacrusis has managed to maintain a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam. It's a more optimistic response than other games that have aped the legendary zombie co-op game. \n\n\nImage via Stray Bombay\n\n\nIt's like Left 4 Dead with a retro vibe and aliens\n\n\nIn case you're not up to date and your eyes glossed over while reading the prior paragraph, The Anacrusis is a first-person co-op game akin to Left 4 Dead and Vermintide. The former makes sense as the studio was co-founded by Chet Faliszek, a former Valve writer who worked on the original L4D games. \n\n\nThe Anacrusis doesn't shy away from its inspiration. Like L4D, a team of up to four players gets together to shoot their way through multiple stages. The game also includes an AI Director that keeps an eye on players and their progress, altering things like ammo or weapon spawns. If you're doing too well, then the Director may try to knock you down a peg.\n\n\nThe Anacrusis isn't a carbon copy of its spiritual predecessor, though. It rocks a retro '70s vibe and some kitschy flair with occasionally salmon-colored environments and weaponry. You also fight against hoards of aliens, as opposed to infected, taken, Ridden, or whatever the hell else we want to call zombies these days. \n\n\nImage via Stray Bombay\n\n\nConsidering its pedigree and the surrounding early praise, The Anacrusis may be the L4D-style game to try when it launches out of Early Access in December. The full version is available on the Steam Store on December 5.\n\nThe post The Anacrusis launches out of Early Access in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We’ll be getting a deeper look at the future of Playdate in an upcoming live stream. The company announced that it will be hosting a 12 minute showcase via YouTube on November 8 at 9a.m. PST. \n\n\nThe showcase is set to introduce developers working on the next slate of Playdate games and to offer some insight into “more fun stuff on the horizon.” In a follow-up message, Playdate teased what that fun stuff might look like. The company wrote, “No big hardware news, but keep an eye out for something blue & new.”\n\n\nImage via Panic\n\n\nSave the date\n\n\nPlaydate was first announced back in 2019, and the little handheld console made its way into gamers' hands for the first time in April 2022. The console’s games follow a bit of a strange release schedule. The first “season” contains 24 different games, which become available two-per-week after you first get your device. Those are the flagship titles, and other games can be bought through Playdate's Catalog service or sideloaded onto the device.\n\n\nThanks in part to the handheld’s unique approach, Playdate has skyrocketed in popularity. A year after its launch Playdate had sold over 50,000 units. That’s more than double what developer Panic had projected and orders were backlogged into late 2023. Currently it’s possible to pre-order a Playdate for when the next batch of devices arrives. \n\n\nThe November 8 showcase could shed some light on when Playdate will be more readily available. It will also finally give owners and people with a pre-order waiting in the wings a peek at what Playdate’s second season of games will look like. \n\nThe post A new Playdate update airs soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Oh, and apparently it fixes that one annoying problem that seemingly keeps coming back. \n\n\nThe latest update is on the smaller side, but it's likely a welcome sight for anybody stuck due to a bug. Last week's update brought a whopping 200 improvements and fixes to the game, covering everything from lip-syncing to overall polish. However, there was one that came back — ironically enough, just like an echo. \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Alan Wake 2 update fixes Hotel progress-halting issues again (maybe)\n\n\nThe last patch attempted to fix an Echo not aligning correctly in the Oceanview Hotel Lobby. Remedy itself called it \"annoying\" while issuing an apology. The bug has been a hard one to squash and is addressed once more in the new patch. Remedy writes that it was \"fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted.\" \n\n\nHere are the patch notes via Remedy:\n\n\n\nXbox Series\n\nA workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.\n\n\n\n\nROOM 665\n\nFixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  \n\n\n\n\nLOCAL GIRL\n\nFixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, Remedy managed to slay the Echo dragon once and for all. Of course, we'll know for sure when the next update rolls our way.\n\n\nRemedy is also working on an update that will add New Game Plus mode to Alan Wake 2.

In a statement to Kotaku, the company explained the reasoning behind the move. \n\n\n“Ubisoft is proceeding with a collective dismissal in its Montreal establishment within the framework of a reorganization of its production support services across Canada, by consolidating these functions Canada wide, Ubisoft will be able to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.” \n\n\nThe company also said it is “providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition” and emphasized that the current restructuring won’t have an effect on its production teams. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nDéjà vu\n\n\nUbisoft as a whole has been facing challenges lately.

          "description": "The Glory Society posted an announcement on Twitter today stating that they have decided to “suspend operations” and that “this is the end of the development of Revenant Hill.”\n\n\nAccording to the announcement, the team has disbanded after two members had to depart due to health reasons. Considering the small size of the team, the task of replacing even two members was too difficult. They also cite the “schedules, budgets, and fraught task of reworking the whole project” as reasons why the team has decided to call it quits.\n\n\n\n\nGlory Society's Scott Benson, in a separate Tweet, has said that he has been diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely resulting from a virus, and that it will \"greatly limit [him] for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\nThe team was working on Revenant Hill. It was set to be a game about a cat trying to make ends meet at the edge of a graveyard. Notably, it involved the co-creators of Night in the Woods. The art style is pretty unmistakable. The game was shown off as part of the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase, but unfortunately, it sounds like it isn’t to be.\n\n\nThe Glory Society's announcement goes on to say that “after the dust has settled, perhaps we’ll talk about what we’ve made and learned together.”\n\n\nLike most creative endeavors, game development requires a great deal of dedication and passion. Setbacks are the truest test of both those things, and overcoming them proves a lot more than any individual success. Hopefully, this isn’t the last we hear from the individual developers of The Glory Society.\n\nThe post The Glory Society suspends operations, Revenant Hill effectively canceled appeared first on Destructoid.",

This follows this year’s August release of The Making of Karateka.\n\n\nThe Making of Karateka feels like an evolution in re-releasing older games. While Karateka itself might be a tough sell in today’s market, Digital Eclipse contextualized it using a tonne of behind-the-scenes footage, documents, and interviews. With this added context, it’s a lot easier to appreciate the game in the spotlight. Beyond that, it also provides great insight into not just the rigors of game development but the business as it was at the time.\n\n\n\n\nThe Making of Karateka was advertised as the first in their Gold Master Series (though it followed the foundation they set with Atari 50). No other titles have been officially revealed. I can definitely think of more than a few that I’d like to learn more about.\n\n\nThe developer was recently acquired by Atari, who has seemingly pivoted to the business of game preservation and has suggested an eagerness to work with Digital Eclipse on similar projects. The chances that the subject this time will be a game from Atari’s history is definitely greater than zero. At the same time, it might not be.\n\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see at Day of the Devs The Game Awards Edition on December 6, 2023.\n\nThe post Next in Digital Eclipse’s Gold Master Series will be announced December 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Epic Games is in court trying to prove that Google is running an illegal monopoly with their Google Play store. As part of the trial, Epic Games Store boss Steve Allison has admitted that the Epic Games Store is still not profitable, according to reporting by The Verge.\n\n\nIf this sounds extremely familiar, it’s because Epic tried to get a similar ruling against Apple. It went pretty poorly for them at that time. I guess all those layoffs the company performed freed up enough budget to pay their lawyers for another go. If at first you don’t succeed.\n\n\nSpeaking of not succeeding, the Epic Games Store doesn’t seem to be. We knew it wasn’t turning a profit from emails revealed in 2021. Part of this is because the company has been doling out money to try and secure exclusivity for certain titles and giving out others for free to try and drive adoption of the platform. More specifically, the leaked emails showed that Epic paid $146 million for Borderlands 3 to be exclusive to the platform.\n\n\nTo put it more into perspective, Epic thought if they gave out free games, secured exclusives, and gave developers a better share of the sales, they would be able to get people to adopt their platform and secure 50% of the PC market. They previously said they expected to start bringing in an annual profit by 2023. Four years later, that strategy still hasn’t worked. Meanwhile, this past September, they laid off 16% of their workforce. When that fails, I suppose the next logical step is to sue your way to success. We’ll see how that works out for them this time.\n\n\nThe Epic Games Store launched in December 2018.

One of which is the recent Resident Evil 4 remake, and it's launching on compatible iOS devices soon.\n\n\nCapcom announced that the Resident Evil 4 remake will be coming to the iPhone 15 Pro on December 20. It will also be available for iPad and Mac devices with the M1 chip or later on the same day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ada Wong-focused DLC, Separate Ways, launches alongside the core game. It features additional content that resolves around \"a secret mission that expands on the adventure and features thrilling new game mechanics.\"\n\n\nThe preorder available now enables a demo of Resident Evil 4. It showcases the beginning of Leon Kennedy's otherworldly endeavors, and gives you a feel for how the game works on mobile devices. You can play via the device's touchscreen or with compatible bluetooth controllers. It's also cross-platform playable with a single purchase so you can easily transfer play across your iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, or Mac. The latter of which offers keyboard and mouse controls. \n\n\nResident Evil 4 isn't the only prominent console title heading towards mobile. Ubisoft also confirmed it will be bringin Assassin's Creed Mirage to iOS platforms. And Capcom's Resident Evil Village launched for the aforementioned Apple devices on October 30. \n\n\nResident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, and Assassin's Creed Mirage are all landing on modern iOS devices without the need for cloud support. It's a pretty incredible time for mobile phone gaming. If you're hesitant, don't be. Resident Evil 4's remake earned a good score when it rolled out for consoles and PC in March.

The Duelist has the ability to switch between Defensive and Aggressive stances while also ignoring enemy defenses and countering attacks with Riposte. She also has the ability to reduce cooldowns and provide offensive and defensive buffs for her team.\n\n\nThe Crusader is a popular hero from the original Darkest Dungeon who is returning for the sequel. The Crusader is a front-line hero with the ability to tank damage while supporting his team with healing and stress recovery.\n\n\nBoth heroes have their own fully voiced backstories including playable flashback encounters that players can explore. Each hero also has their own trinkets and signature items that players can use to specialize them even further.\n\n\nA new roaming mini-boss called The Warlord will also make an appearance in The Binding Blade DLC.

          "description": "It's time again for financial reports, and Nintendo's is particularly interesting, as it reveals that its first-party IPs are doing exceedingly well, including Tears of the Kingdom. \n\n\nIn August, it was revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had sold 18 million copies. With the latest financial report, Nintendo claims that Tears of the Kingdom has sold over a million more copies, bringing up the total to 19.5 million. \n\n\nOther first-party franchises have been also thriving, including Pikmin 4 which is somewhat of a surprise. It has managed to sell 2.61 million copies already, surpassing the sales of prior titles. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have also sold well, managing to top 23.23 million units sold. \n\n\nMario has also been enjoying a good year thanks to the exposure it has been getting from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and Mario 8 Kart Deluxe has sold 3.22 million copies. The company will continue to capitalize on the franchise's popularity through Super Mario RPG Remake and Princess Peach: Showtime!.\n\n\n\n\n\nNintendo's first-party franchises doing amazing numbers\n\n\nAccording to company, net sales during the first half of the fiscal year increased by 21.2%. It is also revealed that \"sales in the first half of the fiscal year were the largest since the launch of Nintendo Switch.\" This has been attributed to a 133.3% year-on-year increase in mobile and IP-related income, as well as the general depreciation of the yen. \n\n\nOverall, the profit margin remained at the same level as last year, which isn't a bad thing. Nintendo, in part, attributes this to the increasing sales of the Switch OLED model which has a smaller profit margin. \n\n\nForever secretive, it is hard to predict what's next for Nintendo. There have been rumors that there is a Switch successor in the works, though president Shuntaro Furukawa has called these reports inaccurate.\n\nThe post Tears of the Kingdom tops 19.5 million units sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the original – The Dark Descent – will always hold a special place in the hearts of horror fans. And if you thought the 2010 game was scary as it is, get ready to play it in VR.\n\n\nAs spotted by PCGamer, a mod over on ModDB has taken the OG Amnesia title and completely remade it. By rebuilding it in the Unity engine (boo hiss, etc.), CreaTeam's Sclerosis has managed to implement VR into the acclaimed horror game.\n\n\n\n\nThe above trailer shows off the more immersive aspects of the game. If you didn't know it was a rebuild, you'd swear it was just the original release. The team looks to have done a comprehensive job remaking Dark Descent, right down to the redesigned controls that have been \"meticulously adapted to virtual reality controllers.\"\n\n\nIf you've missed Amnesia, you've missed a treat\n\n\nI'm a long time fan of the Amnesia series. The first game set quite the tone in the indie horror scene, particularly at a time when the genre was experiencing something of an identity crisis (Resident Evil 5 came out the year before – just saying).\n\n\nWith no ability to defend yourself, being forced to hide from monsters, and the knowledge that staying in the dark too long was just as detrimental, The Dark Descent was a breath of (horrifying) fresh air.\n\n\nWho knows whether Frictional will be able to reinvent the franchise again with subsequent entries.

          "description": "The Steam hardware survey is a chance for Valve to get an idea of the kits PC gamers are using. Not long ago, the likes of Nvidia's RTX 4000 series was hardly being used, but it seems Team Green's latest generation is starting to find its audience.\n\n\nThe most recent Steam survey – specifically the graphics card results – shows that previous generations of Nvidia products are still the preference for Steam users. For example, the RTX 3060 is at the top spot, while the even older 2060 remains in second.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nHowever, you can see that the 4000 series is now on the rise. According to the table, the RTX 4070 saw a jump of 1.19% between September and October. Additionally, the 4060 – which only came out this summer – saw an increase of 1.25%. On the other hand, the RTX 4090 struggles, with a 0.11% decrease.\n\n\nWhy the general increase?\n\n\nAccording to an October report from Digital Trends, AMD and Nvidia graphics cards have been seen at their RRPs or cheaper. This could well explain why more PC users are starting to make the leap to the Ada Lovelace range.\n\n\nOf course, while the Steam hardware survey is useful, it's worth pointing out that participation is completely optional. Therefore, not all users will have taken part, which may or may not skew the results. In any case, it certainly looks like Nvidia's current generation GPUs are finding their way into gamers' systems at last.\n\n\nFor what it's worth: I did decide to take part in the survey. I'm not ashamed of my GTX 960M. You can see it right there near the bottom of the table, with a loss of 0.05%. On second thought, if I ever needed a bigger indicator that I could do with an upgrade, this is probably it.\n\nThe post Latest Steam hardware survey shows Nvidia RTX 4000 cards are on the rise appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the Stardew Valley orchestral tour kicking off in 2024, Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone's highly successful farm-based RPG is still a major talking point in gaming. One can't help but wonder whether the game will make its way into other aspects of pop culture, but that might be easier said than done.\n\n\nYou see, according to an interview with IGN, Barone is quite protective of the Stardew Valley brand. He says that he's wary about just \"[handing] it over to someone\" to make what they want with the IP. This is largely in reference to a potential movie adaptation of the game. While there isn't one in the works, Barone says he'd be interested in a big screen version if the right studio or director came along. However, he still says he would \"need to be closely involved\" with such a project.\n\n\nImagine Stardew Valley set in Twin Peaks\n\n\nIn particular, Barone would likely agree to an adaptation if he was approached by Studio Ghibli. In a somewhat tonal shift away from Japanese animation, he also said he would be happy if Eraserhead and Twin Peaks director David Lynch wanted to make a Stardew movie. Now, who wouldn't want to see that?\n\n\nAs for the game itself, we're anticipating a new update, which the developer has been teasing lately. We don't know when it's likely to roll out, but version 1.6 is said to be adding new dialogue, a new farm type, winter outfits for villagers, and more.\n\n\nIn any case, Stardew is still going strong, notable for having a huge amount of content for a small, independent game. Whether a film adaptation will ever see the light of day remains to be seen, but I'm wondering how Tarantino would portray a sleepy Pelican Town.\n\nThe post Stardew Valley dev is very protective of their IP, and won’t just hand it over appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo just announced a brand new bundle for the Switch OLED that isn’t simply another Mario Kart package. The bundle goes on sale November 19, just in time for Black Friday shopping.\n\n\nThe new Switch OLED includes Super Smash Bros. Ultimate via digital download and three months of Nintendo Switch Online. The Black Friday deal runs at $349.99, saving you about $67.98 — around the cost of a new game if you're looking to add more to the pile. \n\n\nIf the OLED model isn't what you're looking for, Nintendo's also got deals on the Switch Lite. Two new Animal Crossing bundles join the console lineup in time for the holiday season, including a pink Isabelle Aloha Edition and a turquoise Timmy and Tommy Aloha Edition. Isabelle's bundle is a Shopper's Drug Mart exclusive, while Timmy and Tommy editions are only available at Walmart. Both are $259.96.\n\n\nNintendo's Black Friday deals include more than a system bundle, too. Price cuts on games include $25 off The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Luigi's Mansion 3, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe. You can grab some older heavy hitters for $30 off, including Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, Super Mario Odyssey, and Metroid Dread. \n\n\nWith holiday shopping deals revving up for Black Friday, Nintendo has its full list of offers up on its official hub. If you're among those just itching to dive into Super Mario RPG though, that's a sale for a Nintendo sometime in the far, far future. Aside from a few pre-order bonuses, you're stuck paying full price and maybe reading our hands-on experience with the remake while you wait.\n\nThe post Nintendo reveals its Black Friday deals and holiday Switch bundles appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can still do post shots on the platform, but only through the PlayStation App or by offloading and uploading photos manually.\n\n\nPlayStation has not provided further reason for this decision. Changes have been rolling out for the API, and Sony isn't the only one that's shut down its direct integration—Microsoft turned off its Xbox-to-Twitter sharing earlier this year.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the X CEO posted shoddy, blurry gameplay footage of Diablo 4 with an off-screen camera on the same day as this announcement. It shows him defeating Lillith in the worst way possible. Perhaps using the Share function would be a better way to share this epic moment.\n\nThe post PlayStation is losing its Twitter / X integration later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. \n\nThe game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.",

That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go?

Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!\nImpressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a \"talk\" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.\nDonkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled \"Guerilla\", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.\nPurchase",

And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. \n\n\nMore specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place.

It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. \nThe Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents \"blackened by a language he innately understands.\" \n\"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,\" a press release reads. \"An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?\"\nUbisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. \nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1.

          "description": "We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!\nKingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
