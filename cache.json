Yes, those of the NES and SNES were pretty conventional by today's standards (though they were remarkably innovative at the time) but in the ensuing years, the Big N's controllers have had us waving blocks above our heads, tapping chunky kidney-shaped keys, attaching and detaching buttoned bolt-ons, and even trying to work out how exactly these are meant to be played with only two hands.\nOur point is, there's a lot to choose from when it comes to finding the best Nintendo controller out there. There are so many different options, in fact — and so many different opinions — that attempting to find \"the best\" feels somewhat like an impossible task.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Whether through software that brings people of all ages together, hardware features like StreetPass, or the local multiplayer functionality baked into every single Switch console, Nintendo is particularly great at firing up positivity for gaming and giving like-minded fans cause to get together to play and celebrate the games they love. It's why we're here writing about them, and why you're here reading about them. Various Nintendo-focused communities have formed around the world over the years and in the United Kingdom, Nintendo Players UK is the largest.\nAn independent 'umbrella' network of Nintendo fans, NPUK organises physical meetups for gamers in the UK and Ireland and is made up of 29 individual regional communities. Jen Griffiths is part of the NPUK committee and head administrator for this inclusive gaming hub, one which is fast approaching its ten-year milestone this August. \"Our ethos,\" Jen tells us via email, \"is simply to provide free events in person that are inclusive and family-friendly spaces for Nintendo fans to meet and play games with each other.\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

No. Of course it doesn't. To tell you the truth, we have been counting down the days for this one over the past four years, so you'll have to excuse us for getting a little excited now that we are finally, finally on the home straight.\nOf course, a positive to take from this long wait period is that we have come to know Breath of the Wild far better than we might have done if we had received a sequel sooner. For many of us, this version of Hyrule is where we have spent hundreds of hours exploring. We defeated evils, uncovered Shrines, found 900 Korok Seeds (ok, maybe not all of us did that one), and completed a boatload of quests.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, one of the movie's biggest mysteries has now been solved, as we now know who the voice for the lady in the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing commercial is. And it isn't who many suspected it would be.\nBack in February, a teaser for the movie — which was a commercial for the Mario brothers' new plumbing company --- dropped during the Super Bowl, featuring a new rendition of the theme to the Super Mario Bros.

It’s hard to imagine that the studio that would go on to develop the monumentally successful Grand Theft Auto franchise made such a quaint little puzzler. Lemmings was a darn good game, spawning multiple add-ons and sequels over the years. It’s honestly a little surprising that the franchise hasn’t yet seen a (re)release on the Switch.\nEnter Tin Hearts. Created by ex-Fable developers over at Rogue Sun, Tin Hearts is a heartwarming mix of environmental storytelling and Lemmings-like puzzle gameplay. Indeed, the whole premise of the game requires you to guide a troop of “mischievous tin soldiers’ through increasingly complex paths from their starting position to the end goal.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But we're back with another find and this time it's a beautiful Game Boy interpretation of the main theme from the upcoming game.\nPosted on YouTube by New Age Retro Hippie, the video showcases footage from the most recent trailer, but with a green Game Boy filter applied to it. The real star of the show, however, is the music itself.

Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.\nMy aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).\nRead more",

          "description": "Freshly announced puzzle game Crime O’Clock will be putting you in the shoes of a time-travelling detective when it comes out on June 30th, its release date seemingly perfectly timed (sorry) to coincide with Capcom's object-hopping time puzzle detective game, Ghost Trick. In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together. \nRead more",

And after 2017’s standalone expansion, Death Of The Outsider, Bethesda decided to put the series on pause in favour of a shorter, more experimental project - according to Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio, who spoke to me in an interview about their cancelled project The Crossing.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

          "description": "In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that \"really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy\".  \nBut in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.\nRead more",

If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.\r\n\n\r\nDead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A crashing issue with LLife is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.\nDownloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done.

          "description": "When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. \nBut actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list. \nRead more",

The info on Secrets Of Gloomrot doesn't actually use the F word anywhere, but it's a new biome \"twisted by the tortured ambitions of a scientific genius and his legions of followers\", so I feel pretty confident in the citation. This new free addition to the early access vampiric survival game - which won a few hearts here at RPS - is arriving on May 17th. That's in a month, that is, and boy, it's a biggun alright. \nRead more",

They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!\nOr it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.\nWelcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.\nRead more",

          "description": "At PAX West in Seattle last year, I had the pleasure of interviewing the voice cast of Team Fortress 2. I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.\r\n\nFifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as \"The Sandvich Saga\" on a regular basis.\nRead more",

Cosmo Gang the Video adapts these characters and settings to a vertically scrolling shmup format, a genre in which Namco had proven itself a frontrunner.\nhttps://youtu.be/kfI4Z_P5joA\nOne to two players pilot the \"Hyper Beat\" space vessels, on a mission to fend off the Cosmo Gang, who has returned to cause further mayhem across the galaxy. The player battles waves of formation-based enemies over the course of 30+ stages, picking up power-ups and new weapons in order to even the odds against the Cosmo Gang's seemingly endless numbers. It should be noted that, despite its latter-day release date, the title is simplistic, even dated, when compared to the contemporary shmups of the day. Despite this, the arcade saw great success in its native Japan.\nCosmo Gang the Video is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

This is art\nContent creator and self-styled Pokémon archivist, Lewtwo, has announced that they’ve managed to obtain high-quality scans of the original Pokémon artwork by Ken Sugimori.

In other words, this wasn’t something provided as a special case from Nintendo. The images washed out when they came West, but so many sources distributed them that they became ubiquitous.

          "description": "This is our new song\nContent creator Markiplier has announced that he’ll be writing, directing, and starring in a film based on David Szymanski’s short-form horror game, Iron Lung.\nReleased in 2021, Iron Lung became a surprise hit. Oh, hey, I’m even quoted on the Steam page. I absolutely loved it, as it was everything short-form horror should be. It was short, inventive, and also horror. It was more atmospheric than scary, so some people told me they found it boring, which hurt my ego. My recommendations are a lot like my children. I send them out in the world without fulling preparing them, and if they don’t succeed immediately, I feel unreasonably disappointed.\nIn any case, this adaptation of Iron Lung aims to be a theatrical feature. I’m not sure how you turn a 30-45 minute interactive experience into a 90+ minute feature without losing some of the mystique, but here we go. While Markiplier is writing and starring in the film, David Szymanski has been involved and assisting, and that includes helping create the script.\nhttps://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1649452805818658817?s=20\nMany of the details surrounding the adaptation are under wraps, but we do know it will co-star Caroline Rose Kaplan. Markiplier is financing the film by himself. While it hasn’t been revealed if the film will follow the plot of the game – which involved using a submarine to explore an ocean of blood in a universe where all habitable planets abruptly disappeared – David Szymanski says he “couldn't be happier with how it's turning out so far.”\nI don’t have many strong feelings here. I play things, but I rarely watch them. Therefore, both Markiplier and films as a whole are in my periphery, along with sports and human interaction. There’s no reason an Iron Lung movie couldn’t work, so here’s hoping the team can pull it off.\nThe post Iron Lung is being adapted to film by Markiplier appeared first on Destructoid.",

The 10-strong team must capitalize on a huge menagerie of characters, (including a returning PixelCat), abilities, and perks in order to ensure that the whole squad, (well, not always the whole squad), is able to find their respective path through the level and, hopefully, get to the finish line unscathed.\nHelping your teammates, leading the herd, and even committing self-sacrifice so that others may continue will all earn your character the precious resource, Karma, which can be used to unlock new characters, perks, stages, and much more. Check out the action in this announcement trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34FTzOMPSBo&t=2s&ab_channel=Gematsu\nIn addition to The Loop, KarmaZoo also supports several local multiplayer modes, in which you can challenge friends and family to a variety of party-style games, such as being the first to reach the summit of a mountain, races through auto-scrolling mazes and labyrinths, and other quick-fire mini-games. Conquer as many as possible to claim your rightful place on top of the celebratory \"Totem\".\nKarmaZoo looks like a great time-filler — especially for those homestead gatherings — sporting cute graphics, fun characters, and a nice spirit of teamwork and camaraderie. Definitely worth keeping an eye on this release as we closer to its launch window. KarmaZoo is scheduled to launch this summer on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Devolver Digital’s KarmaZoo looks like adorable 10-player mayhem appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're close to launch\nAlthough Nintendo dubbed the most recent event for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom the \"final trailer,\" they weren't counting commercials! The Nintendo of Japan YouTube account dropped several new videos late last night, and they have kernels of new footage to peruse.\nThose kernels are very \"blink and you'll miss it\" stuff (including the beach scene), as much of the reels from the trio of commercials include compilations of the prior two major trailers (the 10-minute one and the aforementioned \"final\" trailer). I mean, I think Zelda fans are already sold, and potentially at their limit of what they wanted to see. Going in blind in Tears of the Kingdom is probably going to be really rewarding for folks, especially when it comes to discerning the little mechanical nuances between the sequel and its predecessor.\nFunnily enough, these clips do give you a pretty good idea of what to expect from the Japanese voice cast, which sounds fantastic. You can check out all three commercials below, or peruse through the Japanese Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom site.\n[gallery columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"374716,374717\"]\nA collection of the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailers with some new footage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo83rurcw8U\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTML1f-l2rQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn3SHPHnuGU\nNintendo also dropped a Zelda: Breath of the Wild recap video just in time\nIn case you need a refresher, you can check out this recap video that goes through the entire plot of the previous game: Breath of the Wild.

          "description": "This seems like an oversight\nRemember when Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp was announced in 2021? Remember when it was delayed, and for how long?! Well if you asked me to recall the whole situation off the top of my head, it would just feel like one big haze. In reality, it's been roughly a year (and change). Well, if those physical copies were printed ages ago, the ability to redeem Gold (bonus) Points on the Switch eShop could be impacted.\nAs reported by Nintendo Life (and pretty much all over every other Nintendo community), some folks are having problems redeeming their Gold Points. As a reminder, people who buy Nintendo games have the ability to earn Gold Points (which can be used to buy games directly) either through a digital purchase (which is done automatically), or a manual redemption of a game cart. But there is a limit on how long that physical redemption process is good for, and it varies from region to region.\nNintendo is reportedly investigating the issue, and we've reached out for comment. This seems like a pretty easy fix, as Nintendo can spare some funny money that encourages people to spend more real money on their storefront.\nThe community is chiming in as well to note that you should keep trying at an irregular interval, as it could end up going through at a later date. I can back this up with experience, as the Gold Point redemption process can be pretty wonky: speaking as someone who has dealt with early review copies.\nThe post Advance Wars Switch was delayed so long, some physical copy Gold Point rewards may have expired appeared first on Destructoid.",

This demo will also allow new fans to check out the Modern Control options and get to grips with the general flow of the fight. In the full release, this adventure mode will let players get to grips with many aspects of Street Fighter 6, from basic movement and attacks to new mechanics such as Drive Impact and Drive Rush. You'll also be able to do a lot of shopping — the true path of the World Warrior.\nOh, and be sure to say hi to Alice, your new favorite Street Fighter weirdo.\nThe Street Fighter 6 World Tour demo is available now on PS5, it will launch on PC and Xbox Series X on April 26.

          "description": "That's a lot of babies\nElectronic Arts is celebrating the arrival of the 70 millionth player to The Sims 4. They’re attributing this to the recent Growing Together expansion, but I’m guessing it has more to do with the fact that The Sims 4 became free to play last October.\nI wouldn’t assume it’s specifically because of The Sims 4 Growing Together, because that expansion sounds like hell to me. It adds the infant stage of development, taking place between newborn and toddler. That’s all I want: more baby. Whenever my husband plays, he always makes these massive families, and for large swathes of time, all I hear is a cacophony of childhood tantrums next to me.\nOn the plus side, it does sound like a significant addition to the formula; it’s just one that makes me instinctively clench my jaw.\nI keep thinking that The Sims 4 is the only good thing that EA really does anymore. Then I remember that it has a bazillion expansions and DLC packs, with new ones dropping every month or so. Whoops, I nearly gave them some credit. I guess I’ll go back to pointing out that they have their own digital storefront, yet the original Sims title isn’t available, along with, like, 90% of Maxis' simulation franchise.\nIf I’m being honest, making the base Sims 4 free was a good move, especially if they want to sell more expansions. It’s like what my local drug dealers and gambling lords all agree on: the first hit is free. Once you’ve got them hooked, then you start sucking them dry.\nOn the other hand, I do think that The Sims 4 is an excellent title after you’ve dumped all your life’s savings into it. I'm not being facetious there; it is a good game. I think it's reasonable to like the game and hate the business model.\nThe post The Sims 4 has sucked in 70 million players appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's going to be another beta for D4, and it starts on May 12, 2023.\nThe official Diablo Twitter account confirmed the news with a simple tweet:\n\"We've heard your feedback, it's time to visit Sanctuary once more before June. Join the Server Slam, May 12-14\"\n\nWhen is the second Diablo IV beta and what can you do in it?\nThat \"once more\"  and \"server slam\" bits tell us a few things. It seems, without further \"feedback\" in play, this is the final \"we promise\" beta period. The official launch is just weeks away on June 6, so there wouldn't be much time to prep and monitor another beta anyway. The phrase \"server slam\" also strongly hints that this is primarily a stress test to help the team calibrate for launch (crossed fingers this isn't D3 again).\nBlizzard subsequently tweeted out more info on this second public beta period, noting that you'll be able to reach level 20, beat Ashava, and earn the Cry of Ashava mount trophy. To think all this was teased earlier this week when that same Twitter account mysteriously alluded to another beta. Hopefully, once June 6 hits we don't all realize we're collectively in another beta: but based on how high folks have been riding on the pre-release of Diablo IV, this could be a much sleeker launch than D3.\nhttps://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1649125838095253538\nThe post Diablo 4 gets another open beta, encourages players to ‘slam the servers’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.\nServer Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here. \nAre you checking out Oxenfree II: Lost Signals this summer?

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023.

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

          "description": "Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. \nSonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer. \n#knuckles pic.twitter.com/Hr4zNjuLuj\nApril 17, 2023\nThe show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).\nPlot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior. \nAre you looking forward to the Knuckles series? Let us know in the comments!",

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. \nIn a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: \n“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  \nIt was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”\nSo there you have it.

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.",

Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay?

That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.\nOfficially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. \n“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”\nMario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. \nThis is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.",

The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.",

In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
