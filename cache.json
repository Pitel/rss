          "description": "Not quite legendary, though.\nA few years ago, FuRyu released The Alliance Alive HD Remastered for Switch—an uprezzed port of a great RPG that was sadly missed by most due to releasing on the 3DS after most players had already moved on to Switch. Yet The Alliance Alive was not the company’s first release on Nintendo’s old handheld; that honor belonged to The Legend of Legacy. This initial release debuted to a divisive reception in 2015 (we awarded it an 8/10 in our review), but evidently the Alliance Alive remaster did well enough to warrant giving its predecessor a second chance with The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered. Though we would still say this is the weaker of the two, FuRyu did a great job of polishing up this overlooked 3DS dungeon crawler; it’s not a stellar example of this genre, but fans will be sure to find plenty to love here.\nLegend of Legacy doesn’t feature very much of a story, which may come as a disappointment to many players. After picking one of seven potential characters, you travel to the mysterious island of Avalon—a recently discovered landmass that rumors say is the home to a grand, ancient treasure. Each of the seven has their own reasons for coming to Avalon, and as you explore its various dungeons, you’ll slowly uncover artifacts revealing bits of lore detailing the civilization that once thrived there, the events that ultimately led to its downfall, and the unique ways in which the seven protagonists are tied to it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside. \r\n\n \nRead more",

On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.\nMy goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head.

Given the project's repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

The ubiquitous chat client already lets you play a handful of approved games inside itself without dowloading or launching anything seperate, along with other 'Activities' like watching YouTube together, and next week it will open up to a whole lot more. Discord will let all developers make their own Activities, wanting to jam in more games and social hangout experiences and stuff. I'm broadly up for things removing faff from getting casual hangout games running with pals.\nRead more",

You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.\nThere are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The latest Helldivers 2 PC patch makes life a bit easier for players fighting the Terminids, aka monstrous hellbugs, on difficulty level 7 or higher, with tweaks to spawn rates for Chargers and Bile Titans, while increasing the spawn rates of certain other, less heavily armoured Terminids to fill the gap. The developers have also lowered the health of the Charger’s head, allowing for instant takedowns with a Recoilless Rifle or EAT-17, without (in theory) entirely doing away with the community’s treasured \"leg meta\", which sees players blasting the juggernaut’s limbs to sabotage it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very \"arcadey\" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you.

Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon's Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn't realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. \r\n\n\r\nThe game's Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it?

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

This has led people to ask what on earth players are doing to their spouses to make this happen. \n\n\nThe post also sparked a lot of requests for the ability to marry certain NPCs that can currently not be married, such as Willy or Robin. The number of people asking for this is pretty shocking, actually. I’m not sure why so many people want to marry Willy, but to each their own I suppose. \n\n\nThis Tweet is the latest in a string of ConcernedApe Tweets detailing small updates that are coming in patch 1.6, with the others being: \n\n\n\nFruit Trees will yield Saplings of the same fruit\n\n\nHarvesting will be at the same speed in either direction\n\n\nLarger area of effect for downward Melee attacks will be larger\n\n\nMoving past pets will now take less time\n\n\n\nWho’s to know what else will be revealed before the patch notes drop on March 19, but stay tuned for more tidbits of information!\n\nThe post The latest sneak peak of Stardew Valley’s 1.6 patch notes has raised some questions from players appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alongside it is a 2024 launch window, and apparently, Digital Eclipse (and Atari) are helping with the project as publishers.\n\n\nI’m going to be upfront with you: I know next to nothing about Jay and Silent Bob. I’ve watched the 1999 film Dogma, which featured the characters, as well as 2001’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and I mostly enjoyed them, but stoner humor just isn’t in my wheelhouse. I’ve abstained from drugs and alcohol my whole life, so I just don’t relate to it. That isn’t a moral stance, either, it’s just whenever I’m not in full control over my thoughts and actions, I always do or say something completely stupid.\n\n\n\n\nI do know beat-’em-ups, however, and from what I can tell, Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch is a beat-’em-up. 2020’s Jay and Silent Bob: Mall Brawl was also a beat-’em-up, but while that title went for an NES retro-style aesthetic, Chronic Blunt Punch has a much more detailed cartoon look to it.\n\n\nThe trailer is mostly focused on an animated interpretation of the gameplay, but it also shows some scenes of the gameplay itself, with the eponymous heroes beating up road hockey players and phone-addicted teens. The animated portions show some super-hero sentai sequences and the genre-mandatory S&M boss. There’s probably a bunch of references sprinkled around that I don’t get, but hopefully, you do.\n\n\nJay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch is coming sometime in 2024. The target platforms have not been revealed yet, but PC is one of them.\n\nThe post New animated trailer shows of Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch’s beat-’em-up stylings appeared first on Destructoid.",

I personally had my issues with Ion Fury, but a lot of other people really connected with it.\n\n\n\n\nPhantom Fury leaves the Build Engine behind but doesn’t completely abandon the retro-inspired graphics. While it’s moving to a full-3D engine, it looks like something more circa Y2K. It hasn’t been explicitly said by the developers (that I know of), but it seems to be presenting itself as an alternate reality Duke Nukem Forever, following an alternate reality Duke Nukem 3D. It’s as if that game actually released when it was supposed to instead of over a decade later. Hopefully, it will actually be good.\n\n\nI played the demo of Phantom Fury a while back when it first became available. While it didn’t entirely sell me on the game, it was a competent enough slice that was full of appreciable small details. It’s important to note that while Ion Fury was developed by Voidpoint, Phantom Fury is being done by Slipgate Ironworks.\n\n\n3D Realms recently saw layoffs as part of the restructuring of Embracer Group. It has been reported that they are now leaving Embracer as part of the $500 million sale of their parent company, Saber. The whole situation must be hell to try and work through, but it’s nice to see that the team was able to get Phantom Fury to the finish line.\n\n\nPhantom Fury will be released on PC on April 23, 2024.\n\nThe post Ion Fury follow-up Phantom Fury releases in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Sacred Reunion will be released on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch platforms on April 4.\n\n\nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon was released last year. I reviewed it then, and it was… enh. It was all right. I felt that the combat wasn’t that great and, at the time, you couldn’t really do much with the character swapping. You couldn’t tie your second character into your combo. I’m not sure how much has changed since then, as there have been patches to tweak the mechanics.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three characters joining the roster. One has been revealed, while the other two are shadowed out. I bet one of them is Sonny Lee, the disappointing and unremarkable third Lee brother. The revealed character is Ranzou, who was a character in both Double Dragon 3’s and also an unlockable combatant in Double Dragon IV. He’s a ninja who fights with shuriken and a katana (or maybe a wakazashi).\n\n\nAlso being added is survival mode, which I assume is wave-based. There’s also a versus mode where you can give your friends a savage beating. Also included is online co-op. That should be good news for people with distant relationships, but I prefer to be able to “playfully” punch the person I’m playing with. There will also be new upgrades.\n\n\nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragon is available on PS4, PS5, Switch, PC, and XBox. The Sacred Reunion DLC will be available for free on April 4.\n\nThe post Free Double Dragon Gaiden DLC will bring new modes and a ninja appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ravenage Games and Dapper Journey have announced the launch date for Biogun, a microscopic exploration platformer coming to PC on April 16.\n\n\nBioGun is billed as a twin-stick shooter Metroidvania where you play as a vaccine-fighting a “desperate battle” inside a dog. If it’s anything like my dog, it was probably eating bird poop again. Your fantastic voyage takes you “from the depths of the bladder to the pulsating heart.” Beyond traversing the insides of a dog, you can also complete side-quests to help cells that are in need.\n\n\n\n\nListen, this is important. Dogs are getting wiped out by a virus, and this vaccine (meaning you) is the only thing that can stop it. No one wants to live in a world without dogs.\n\n\nAlthough it refers to itself as a twin-stick shooter, it’s not Metroidvania Smash T.V. – or Smashtroidvania, as I will now refer to it in my design document. It’s still a sidescroller akin to Gunbrella. I’m digging the art style. I find that a lot of 2D games, when they don’t choose to go with pixel art, can sometimes look rather flat and bland, but BioGun has a nice, lively, colorful style to it. Hopefully, it can live up to the intervenous antics of Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon.\n\n\nIf you want to give it a try ahead of time, a demo – cleverly named BioGun: Clinical Trial – is available right now.\n\n\nOtherwise, BioGun will be released on PC on April 16, 2024.\n\nThe post BioGun looks like a fantastic voyage, is out next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

The developer and platform holder are hosting a giveaway on Twitter, offering one lucky winner an Xbox Series X crafted to look like one of the MMO's Aetheryte crystals. It's cool as hell, plus it comes with other goodies. \n\n\nIn addition to the one-of-a-kind console, so not one you can just go out and buy, the winner bundle comes with the Complete Collectors Edition of Final Fantasy XIV along with a 12-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Membership. \n\n\n\n\nSadly, according to the smallprint attached to the Twitter post, the FFXIV themed Xbox is not a functioning console in itself and should be considered an art piece.

Unfortunately, anyone outside of these locations cannot enter. You must be registered on Twitter, and the winner will be chosen at random on or around March 29. \n\n\nIf you meet these requirements, simply follow the two Twitter accounts stated in the post and share the post with the required hashtag to be in with a chance to have this item on your shelf and a shiny new console.\n\nThe post This Final Fantasy XIV sweepstakes Xbox looks like a real-life Aetheryte appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's not often we get to have surprises in World of Warcraft. Datamining is so common that it's hard to avoid knowing everything about an event before it starts. That's handy for having guides ready, but there aren't many surprises left for players to discover. However, that's not the case for patch 10.2.6 — for now, no one aside from Blizzard has any details beyond the pirate flag teaser. \n\n\nThis could mean anything. Maybe it's a storyline about major pirate factions going to war with each other. Perhaps the Bloodsails are going to try and take over Stormwind. It could just be \"Talk Like a Pirate Day 2: Buccaneer Boogaloo.\" There really are no clues as to what's happening, and that's incredibly refreshing.\n\n\nIf we're looking for connections, there is a vague one. Dragonflight had no real pirate activity in any of the storylines, despite having a treasure-rich island. But there have been a lot of dragons, including the Infinite Dragonflight. The expansion prior, Shadowlands, featured a dungeon that had a surprise appearance by a time traveling pirate dragon.\n\n\nImage via Blizzard\n\n\nIn Tazavesh, the Veiled Market, we run into some extra-dimensional bandits who end up stealing something from pirates in Boralus Harbor. The leader of said pirates turns out to be Timecap'n Hooktail, a new character invented for the dungeon. It seemed like a waste of one of the best character designs ever made by human hands that Hooktail died in that fight. But, with time being all wibbly-wobbly, and dragons being the current focus of the expansion, perhaps Blizzard is bringing back Hooktail for another adventure.\n\n\nWhatever it is, it's coming next Tuesday, March 19, arriving just in time to deliver some fresh new pirate threads to wear to the Trial of Style next Wednesday, March 20. \n\nThe post World of Warcraft patch 10.2.6 launches March 19, and nobody knows what’s in it appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There are a lot of resources in Disney Dreamlight Valley and one of them, Glimmer, can be harder to find than others. Glimmer is used in recipes such as the Tavern Piano and Bing Bong’s Wagon, so it’s worth going after. \n\n\nBefore you can head out in search of Glimmer, you need to upgrade your Hourglass to level 2. To do this, you’ll need to spend 10,000 Mist at the Timebending table. Upgrading your Hourglass will unlock more recipes and allow you to find more resources, including Glimmer. \n\n\nHow to find Glimmer in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGlimmer cannot be found on the usual maps of Disney Dreamlight Valley. In order to find Glimmer, you’ll need to head to one of the following Realms:\n\n\n\nRatatouille\n\n\nMoana\n\n\nWall-E\n\n\nFrozen\n\n\nToy Story\n\n\nThe Lion King\n\n\nBeauty and the Beast\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, you cannot find Glimmer within the Monsters Inc. Realm. This is likely to be added in a future update, so we’ll keep you posted.\n\n\nTo make this easier, you can open up the map and use the Fast Travel menu to instantly travel to Realms. Once you’re there, use your Hourglass as you usually wood to open up rifts. Glimmer is one of the possible (and more likely) drops when inside Realms. \n\n\nWhat is Glimmer used for in Disney Dreamlight Valley?\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nGlimmer is used as an ingredient in the following items, along with other resources found with the Royal Hourglass:\n\n\n\nAgrabah Palace Model\n\n\nBing Bong’s Wagon\n\n\nHighland Family Tapestry\n\n\nIce Harvester’s Pallet Bed\n\n\nMonster-of-the-Month Frames\n\n\nMythic Vase\n\n\nScrooge’s First Dime\n\n\nTavern Piano\n\n\nThe V8 Cafe\n\n\nThe post How to find Glimmer in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If there’s one thing that has always caused issues in Palworld, it’s managing Pals on your base and trying to get them on a specific task. Well, according to PocketPair’s community manager, Bucky, that may soon be a thing of the past. \n\n\nIn a post to the official Palworld Discord Server, Bucky revealed that as part of the next update, we’ll now be able to allocate Pals to certain jobs using a new feature planned for the Monitoring Stand. The preview image mostly speaks for itself. There's a list of up to 20 Pals and columns outlining the usual skills your critters may, or may not, be good at. \n\n\nImage via PocketPair\n\n\nBucky didn’t share too much information, much less when we can expect this update to arrive, but things look to be moving towards a large update some time soon, with Bucky saying that this was “a little sneak peak of another feature”, alluding to more that we have yet to see. \n\n\nI can personally attest to the infuriating system, or lack of one, that’s currently in place on the base. My Pals are known to do whatever they like, whenever they like and little that I do seems to change this. \n\n\nThis updated system will likely put an end to having to physically pick up Pals and throw them at whichever piece of equipment we’d like them to work at, something that will be very welcomed by players. Of course, you’ll still have to manage Sanity levels by the usual means and the Monitoring Stand will still allow you to work Pals harder, or go easier on them, depending on your preference. \n\n\nAlong with this new base management system, we also have the new Bellanoir raid to look forward to, and this is just what we know so far. Whenever this update arrives, it seems to be full of new content and improvements. We’ll let you know as soon as we hear more.\n\nThe post The next Palworld update will include dedicated Base management feature appeared first on Destructoid.",

Stay tuned!”\n\n\nImage via Wizards of the Coast\n\n\nLee Kaburis, Executive Producer at Gameloft Montreal has said “we are all big fans of D&D and are already hard at work bringing our concept to life, including growing our team, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future.”\n\n\nEugene Evans, SVP of Digital Strategy and Licensing at Wizards of the Coast says about Gameloft: “Given their impressive record building incredible new experiences with major IPs combined with their passion for D&D and vision for this game, we are confident they will create an experience that will delight fans worldwide.”\n\n\nAccording to the Instagram post, Gameloft is also actively recruiting for the project.\n\nThe post Gameloft is making a D&D survival life-sim RPG set in the Forgotten Realms appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It may not feel like it here in the UK, but we're on our way to spring, leaving the much colder days behind us. To kick-start the season, the Steam Spring Sale is already in session, and I've got my eye on a number of games that have been sat in my wishlist for ages.\n\n\nThis is probably the first major sale event of 2024 for the platform. While Steam has had a few already, this one feels like a much bigger deal, and there are plenty of things to choose from. There's no specific sales page, though. It's just a vast selection of titles that are going to be cheaper for a short while.\n\n\n\n\nJust looking at the front page, I can see Palworld is currently 10% off, Ark: Survival Ascended is 20% off, and you can also get the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Hogwarts Legacy for half-price. The Spring Sale began yesterday, and will continue up to March 21. \n\n\nAnd then some\n\n\nOn a personal note, it's become pretty apparent that Steam wants me to buy some horror games, or all the horror games. I'm not entirely sure if this is based off what I've wishlisted in the past, or there's a market during this time of year for these types of games.\n\n\nI can see Project Zomboid, Lethal Company, Escape the Backrooms, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Resident Evil 4, and Diablo 4 all on sale currently. I get it, guys. Sheesh.\n\n\nThere isn't much else to say about it. You all know how Steam sales work, whatever time of year they're live. So I'll just close by asking what everyone's doing this weekend. I'm probably doing some stuff in the garden. Hooray for being 40!\n\nThe post The Steam Spring Sale is now in full swing appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The ‘90s were overwhelmingly glutted with one-on-one fighting games vying for arcade dominance, so it isn’t surprising that there might be a few that you hadn’t heard of. Take 1997’s Rabbit, for example, which just received a fan translation patch.\n\n\nRabbit was developed by Aorn, who is known for… Rabbit. It was published by Electronic Arts Victor, which was EA’s Japanese publishing arm, through a partnership with Victor Music Industries/Victor Entertainment.\n\n\nAs I mentioned, the fighting game scene exploded in the wake of Street Fighter 2, and while it was extremely competitive here in North America, it was even more pervasive in Japan at the time. The ‘90s saw the arcade in North America already in decline, but in Japan they still held strong, and that is partially due to the popularity of fighting games. This carried over to the home, where console hardware was starting to catch up to the arcade.\n\n\nEvery publisher wanted a piece of the pie that had already been chewed by more established brands, so it’s no surprise that EA wanted to try. Electronic Arts Victor was typically tasked with localizing EA’s existing titles, so Rabbit stands out as a unique endeavor. It was released on the Sega Saturn in 1997, and there was also a version for arcade. It wasn’t, however, localized for the West.\n\n\nImage via Romhacking\n\n\nAs for Rabbit itself, it’s a bright, colorful, and supposedly competent fighting game. There’s a selection of eight characters, each with their own spirit animal that can be summoned to fight alongside. Coincidentally, it was released very close to Bloody Roar, which also had animal powers, but the two games are miles apart.\n\n\nLike most fighting games, Rabbit could easily be played without knowing Japanese, but you’d be missing out on all the cutscene dialogue.\n\n\nThe fan translation patch for Rabbit is available now thanks to Derek Pascarella, Bo Bayles, Walnut, and Malenko.\n\nThe post Obscure Sega Saturn fighting game Rabbit receives a fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

For Black Armory fans, in particular, there may be good stuff here, as the latest announcement from Bungie is more revealing than we thought.\n\n\nFor quite a long while now, the Destiny 2 community has been asking Bungie to reissue the highly acclaimed Black Armory weapons, as the full repertoire got caught up in the game's big sunsetting of content. Now, at long last, we're finally getting the sense that things are happening on that front, as we now have not one but two separate sources suggesting Black Armory gear is going to be back on the menu in this or that form.

          "description": "Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an \"innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.\"\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. \nCurrently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature \"unique cooperative gameplay,\" the studio says. \n\"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,\" the announcement reads.\" \nThere's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. \nNews of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here. \nAre you excited about this game? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of \"the greatest of all time\" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. \nWhat's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. \nHowever, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. \nIt's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right.

Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a \"Shrieker Lair\" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like \"smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.\" \n\n\nShrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. \nKeep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game.

This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. \nSabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: \n\n\n\"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure,\" a press release reads. \"The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon.\" \nAs you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development. \nAre you interested in Sea of Stars' three-player co-op mode?

This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. \nThe biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. \nWhile Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. \n\n\n\"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years,\" board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. \"Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors.\"\nGoeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, \"Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review.

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?",

He was 68.\nThe news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry.

Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.\nAs Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. \nPrepare thyselves, mere mortals!\npic.twitter.com/0d91p34hCu\nMarch 7, 2024\nUnfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.\nOnly time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. \nIn the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month. After that, read about how Disney and Epic Games are partnering up to create a games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite. \nAre you excited for Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals?

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
