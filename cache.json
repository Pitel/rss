          "description": "\"Collaboration contents from outside Capcom will not be carried over\".\nThe Nintendo 3DS had plenty of incredible exclusives and in its heyday, a lot of those were in the Monster Hunter series. One gem that truly stands out from its no-glasses-3D siblings is Monster Hunter Stories. Developed as a collaboration between Capcom and Marvelous, this turn-based RPG was quite a massive departure in comparison to anything that's come before and is highly regarded by those that did play it. However, Stories was overlooked by many at the time as it was dealt the unfortunate hand of launching six months after the console that would replace the 2DS and 3DS, the Nintendo Switch.\nFlash forward to the year 2024, and not only has a Switch sequel to Stories released, but that first game that fans loved so much is finally making its way to Switch, too. We had the chance to send off a few questions to the Monster Hunter Stories team at Capcom and the game's producer, Yoshihiro Akira, was kind enough to give us his insight on the game's co-development with Marvelous, 3DS-exclusive features, and what it's like bringing this game to a new audience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Remaking money.\nAs Nintendo's internal software focus has switched to games for its as-yet-unannounced hardware, we've been enjoying a wave of lower-key ports, remakes, and remasters over the last year or so, in addition to the tentpole TOTKs and Mario Wonders of the world. The sun may be slowly setting on Switch, but quality revisits such as Metroid Prime Remastered, Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario: TTYD hardly feel like stop-gaps. Even less exciting games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD represent hearty late-gen fare, especially for players who never played the originals.\nStill, if you are a returning player, you might be looking at the price tag for these games and raising an eyebrow. Nintendo has said in the past that it looks at pricing on a \"case-by-case\" basis, so here's a look at the MSRP of all the recent Switch remasters/remakes/ports it's published since the beginning of 2023:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Of course, it absolutely should do for 300 bucks, but looking at the myriad details crammed into the 2500-piece set — which covers both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild incarnations of the ancient tree — the care and attention that's gone into this latest Nintendo-themed Lego creation is obvious.\nEschewing the innovative play features of the course-based Lego Super Mario line, this build carries an 18+ age recommendation so it's clearly targeting a different demographic from the Mario or Animal Crossing sets.

Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.\nRead more",

          "description": "In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

They have no planned breaks for the season. Therefore, each episode should be released promptly on Sunday.\n\n\nUnlike the previous seasons, which were all over 10 episodes long, Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc is rumored to be far shorter. As of now, there appears to be no official announcement -- but many in the community are in resounding agreement that it'll be eight episodes. This speculation is based on the length of the arc in the manga, which is only eight chapters long, making for roughly one episode per chapter. \n\n\nIf they officially announce the number of episodes, expect this article to be updated with the appropriate information. \n\nThe post Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc full release schedule and times appeared first on Destructoid.",

For one reason or another, it just hadn’t made its way into my gaming library.\n\n\nThat changed when I befriended Chris, who had a long history with Destiny and Destiny 2. It turned out that Bungie had recently added a system allowing new players to skip past the early stages and jump straight to the endgame.

          "description": "After numerous bigger than life adventures, Edens Zero draws close to its inevitable conclusion. In a couple more chapters, Shiki Granbell will have accomplished his monumental task -- making the end of an era for fans of the series. As to avoid spoilers, I'll leave out direct story elements from this article. Here is everything to know regarding Edens Zero chapter 290. \n\n\nWhen does Edens Zero chapter 290 come out? \n\n\nAccording to Weekly Shonen Magazine, Edens Zero chapter 290 releases June 4, 2024. As a part of Weekly Shonen Magazine, Eden Zero's new chapter release date is the day a new magazine issue drops. The speculated release time is 8 am PST, a time based on the upload of the chapter in the previous week. \n\n\nWeekly Shonen Magazine releases every Wednesday in Japan, which is every Tuesday in the US. Therefore, the Edens Zero chapter 290 release date is on June 4, assuming there are no complications that delay the release.\n\n\nFor those wanting to read it for free, you can check in on the kmanga's official site on June 9, 2024. This is five days after its initial release. You can also read it as part of volume set 29, which releases on June 25, 2024. \n\n\nWhat to expect\n\n\nHiro Mashima, the creator of Edens Zero, has begun wrapping up loose ends for the series. Rather than prolonging the series' life, like how he did with Fairy Tail, Mashima is approaching Edens Zero closer to how he approached Rave Master. In essence, he's going for a concise story rather than a drawn-out one. \n\n\n\n\nEven after Edens Zero ends, fans will likely see many of the characters again in the near future. Hiro Mashima has a tendency to recycle character designs and concepts in his future series. Therefore, although we will soon have to say goodbye to the series, we may not have to say bid our farewells to all the characters. \n\nThe post Edens Zero chapter 290 release date, time, and what to expect appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The New York Times has sued an offshoot of its viral web game Wordle. Again. If I had to guess, the word of the day is \"petty.\"\n\n\nThis time, the [insert-word-here]-le game on the legal chopping block is Worldle, a geography-themed puzzle game designed by Seattle-based developer Kory McDonald. Averaging around 100,000 players a month, Worldle presents you with the outline of a specific country or territory and challenges you to guess which one it is. It's like a highly condensed version of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, but you aren't looking for a trench-coated spy.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Worldle is now in the crosshairs of the New York Times, which purchased Wordle from its original developer, Josh Wardle, for an undisclosed seven-figure sum back in 2022. In a legal document obtained by the BBC, The New York Times argues that McDonald is trying to \"cause confusion\" and take advantage of Wordle's \"enormous goodwill\".\n\n\nI'll be the first to admit that Worldle shares more than a few DNA strands with Wordle, but McDonald is far from the first developer to coast off of Wordle's success. There's a Wordle clone for mathematicians, music lovers, and Pokemon fans. I'm especially fond of the last one, myself.\n\n\nThis isn't even the first time the New York Times has sicced the metaphorical hounds on a game inspired by Wordle. The newspaper has proven to be immensely protective of what has become one of its most marketable investments, filing DMCAs against many Wordle-inspired games. If there's an -le at the end of its title, the game may as well paint a target on itself.\n\n\nFortunately for Worldle fans, McDonald told the BBC that he's not letting his game go down without a fight, telling the interviewer that \"worst-case scenario, we'll change the name, but I think we'll be okay.”\n\nThe post The New York Times is suing another Wordle off-shoot appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's where to spot them in this big battle royale open world. \n\n\nSlurp Cactus in Fortnite location\n\n\nThe Slurp Cactus is a new interactive object in Fortnite that lets you gain shields after ramming it with a vehicle or hitting it with a weapon. They can be found all over the new desert area to the south of the Chapter 5 Season 3 map. Find a car near a location like the Nitrodome and while driving, look on both sides of the road. You'll see cacti that have blue gooey leaves on them. Ram into these plants and you'll gain a shield boost. \n\n\nScreenshots by Destructoid\n\n\nOne of the Weekly Quests asks you to restore 300 health or shields with the Slurp Cactus. Once this is completed, you'll net yourself 15,000 XP. It also accounts for the bonus goals, which ask you to complete a certain amount of Weekly Quests. If you finish 12, for example, there is a 25K experience bonus.\n\n\nOther Weekly Quests in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3\n\n\nThe other weekly quests in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 are a cakewalk.

The best way to take them out is to uppercut them, then smash your fists down while you're in the air. \n\n\nAdditionally, you can damage opponents with your car by either ramming them or modding a weapon to the top of your vehicle. You can collect them from boxes strewn throughout the map. Another quest is to go through a Flaming Boost Hoop. \n\nThe post Where to find Slurp Cactus in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Dark Matter mission in Helldivers 2 is getting a hotfix following numerous reports of bugs and, um, bugs. \n\n\nOn May 30, the second phase of the Major Order 'Enduring Peace' began with a shocking demand from Super Earth's finest: Wipe the planet Meridia off the galactic map once and for all. To do so, divers had to inject a clearly dangerous substance known as Dark Fluid into the crust of Meridia — a planet swarming with Terminid following the failed Termicide experiment. Once enough of the stuff was injected the planet, the rock would collapse into a black hole. Sadly, things have been going quite badly.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers have been repor…",

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.\nThe studio states its new title is \"very early in development\" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.\nWe're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about!

The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series. \nYou can read our review of Toys for Bob's most recent release, Crash Team Rumble, here.",

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.",

          "description": "Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.\nThe trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

Unlike the last entry, Astro's Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. \nThe trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6.

It revealed this during today's State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. \nThis follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while \"tentpole\" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. \nAs you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: \n\n\nAccording to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. \nGod of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review. \nAre you going to check out this game out on PC later this year?

          "description": "Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.\n\n\nBallad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: \"You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.\"\nIn addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. \nBallad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.",

          "description": "PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal?

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far?

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds.

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",
