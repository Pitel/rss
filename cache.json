          "description": "Walking in a winter wonderland.\nIt’s been a busy year for Riot’s new Forge publishing arm, aimed at expanding its League of Legends Runeterra universe in games beyond the popular MOBA. In April, we got The Mageseeker, a hi-bit brawler set in the austere kingdom of Demacia, and in June, we got Convergence, a traditional Metroidvania set in the seedy depths of the city of Zaun. To finish out the year, the company has now published Song of Nunu, a narrative action game developed by Tequila Works, which previously developed RiME back in the early days of the Switch library. We’re pleased to report that Song of Nunu is yet another strong addition to the Runeterra universe, expertly combining a gripping narrative with enjoyable gameplay.\nSong of Nunu is set in the Freljord, a harsh, frigid, mountainous region in the north of Runeterra, and follows the adventures of an energetic young boy named Nunu and his affable yeti friend, Willump. Nunu’s mother has gone missing since his camp was attacked by raiders and he keeps having dreams where she tells him to find “The Heart of the Blue” at the Winged Mountain. Aided by Willump’s strength, Nunu sets out on a quest to reach the mountain, where he expects to find some answers about what happened to his mother and hopes to be reunited with her. All the while, however, the two are unknowingly pursued by a dangerous ice witch named Lissandra, who wishes to use Willump’s unique powers to help her fight back against a shadowy force that threatens the whole Freljord.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Crytek have no plans to make a sequel to sweaty monster-culling FPS Hunt: Showdown, and will thus hopefully avoid the publicity problems currently faced by Activision-Blizzard's Overwatch 2 and Valve's Counter-Strike 2 - both presented as sequels with fancier technology, but in practice, more like service-game content seasons arbitrarily upgraded into replacements, with the 'previous' games, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, being taken offline to avoid splitting the playerbase. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to me in an interview about Hunt's evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game's general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won't be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won't come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. \nNow, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual \"next-gen\" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: \"I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do.\" \nRead more",

I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.\nBut dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.\nRead more",

I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.\nRead more",

The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. \nHappily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, \"Objection!\" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend. \nRead more",

Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.\nRead more",

The first concerns Alan Wake's fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves \"an independent government organization\" that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's much more common to see 27-inch monitors at this resolution, with a 24-inch screen providing a sharper image as a result of a higher DPI. This model from Chinese manufacturer Koorui also comes with a Fast IPS panel with 1ms GtG pixel response times and a 165Hz refresh rate, making it a great choice for fast-paced gaming too. \nThis Koorui monitor has also been reduced in price, dropping from an initial MSRP of $400 to just $200 after a cool 50% reduction - with a $15 gift card thrown in too. \nRead more",

          "description": "OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. \r\n\n\r\nSo why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. \nAlan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet. \nRead more",

          "description": "At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map \"powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline\".\nI've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.\nRead more",

Amongst other things, it looks like you can run people over with a horse-drawn carriage. M-Rated enough for you, edgelords? Here's the trailer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” \r\n\n\r\n\r\nPétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.\nThe game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.\nRead more",

It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. \nThe goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little.

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will \"absolutely\" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will \"probably\" retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?\nI couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself.

          "description": "If you've been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.\r\n\n\r\nI'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.\r\n \nRead more",

Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.\nThat's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error.

It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through \"OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson\" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2.

          "description": "The early days of reality television were embarrassing for all of us. Actually, no, reality television is still embarrassing for us. Every time I visit my parents, where they still have cable, there’s some show about detailing cars or antiquing that is on TV. Fear Factor was something special, though. I don't mean that in a good way.\n\n\nFear Factor was a game show that was advertised as a show about people overcoming fear to both humiliate themselves and win money. I’m pretty sure people just tuned in to watch the contestants eat bugs, which was almost invariably what they did in the middle of the three events. But there are so many times you can air people cringing as they eat insects before even the least discerning audience gets bored, so the series only ran from 2001-2006. I say “only” …",

Every Riot Forge title so far has expanded on the already incredible IP of League of Legends and the world of Runeterra. And based on the trailer, it looked like Song of Nunu would be one of the most lore-rich titles from Riot Forge yet. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong.\n\n\nThroughout my journey as Nunu, I had fought off evil wolves with Braum, commanded Krugs with Nunu's flute called the Svellsongur, and even forged a cauldron with the help of the legendary blacksmith Ornn.

An email sent to Bungie employees from Bungie CEO Pete Parsons indicated staff would be \"hearing some news today\" and that a team meeting scheduled for later would \"discuss today's events\". Jason Schreier at Bloomberg saw and reported the circulating email.\n\n\nAs of now the exact number of employees affected by the layoffs is unknown, but Twitter is already full of Bungie employees sharing the news that they have been laid off.\n\n\n\n\"I've been laid off from Bungie. A surreal thing to write as I sit here pondering what went wrong. I'm still processing it all and while my first instinct is anger I know I'd regret what I'd say. Thank you to everyone at Bungie who helped make my last 5+ years the best ever.\"\n- Griffin Bennett, Social Media Lead at Bungie\n\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, employees also indicated delays across the board at Bungie. Upcoming Destiny 2 expansion The Final Shape has been pushed from February 2024 to June 2024. Also, Bungie's next game, a sci-fi extraction shooter titled Marathon has been delayed to 2025.\n\n\nBungie joins a huge list of studios that have cut employees this year, which has led to one of the more tumultuous waves of layoffs the industry has seen in a while.

          "description": "We seem to be getting closer and closer to knowing whether Nvidia is planning a SUPER variant of the RTX 4080. While it's not yet been confirmed to be in development, the supposed new model has been seen on an ID repository site.\n\n\nAs reported by PC Gamer, the unannounced RTX 4080 SUPER is now listed on PCI ID, a third-party database that lists hardware info. This particular entry was uploaded a few days ago, showing not only that it'll be a SUPER rather than a Ti, but that it'll utilize the AD103 chip.\n\n\nImage via Nvidia.\n\n\nObviously, details about it are scarce at the moment. With speculations hotting up for this slightly souped up 4080, Nvidia may want to make a statement about it soon.\n\n\nA (Ge)force to be reckoned with\n\n\nUntil we know for sure what's going on with the refreshed card, we can only go off leaks and rumors. It was suggested recently that the alleged Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER would sport 20GB of VRAM. It also said that it would use the full AD102 chip, the same one the 4090 is built on.\n\n\nHowever, if what the repository says is true, then it may be the AD103 instead, which is in-line with the current RTX 4080 model. The report from PC Gamer goes on to say that the SUPER could contain around 5.3% more shaders, based on hardware knowledge.\n\n\nIf it does come to fruition, it will likely offer a bit more juice than its regular RTX 4080 counterpart. However, if past experience is anything to go by – looking at you, RTX 3090 Ti – Nvidia may mark it up beyond what its specs suggest it's actually worth.\n\nThe post Rumored Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER now spotted on a hardware repository appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now the pair of RPGs are locked in for February 16, 2024.\n\n\nNIS America confirmed a launch date for the pair alongside a new gameplay trailer. After showing off some of the characters, the video quickly dives into the updated Erebonia experience. Rean Schwarzer and the Class VII: Special Operations squad then show off their skills with some flashy moves and Link Attacks. See how it all looks on PS5 below.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the trail hot\n\n\nBoth entries in the series — originally released in Japan in 2017 and 2018, respectively — will be available separately digitally. The real meat here is the two-in-one collection that includes a ton of role-playing bang for your buck. Those who want to burn approximately 99 of those bucks will be able to do so with the limited edition physical release. NIS America previously revealed the package, which includes the game, a soundtrack, art books, and more. \n\n\nAfter the original Japanese release, Trails of Cold Steel III launched globally in 2019, followed by IV in 2020. They're also available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The PS5 release includes English and Japanese audio, as well as English and French text for III (just English for IV).

          "description": "Ubisoft has revealed its various recommendations when it comes to PC hardware needed to run Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. They’re not especially surprising.\n\n\nYou’ll need a reasonably recent setup to actually get Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The minimum GPU is AMD RX 5700 or Nvidia Geforce 1070. The minimum required VRAM is 8GB. You’ll also need 90GB of free space on your hard drive and at least 18GB of RAM.\n\n\nHowever, if you want to run everything at max and in 4K, you’ll need the latest generation of cards. This means at least an AMD RX 7900 XTX 24GB or an Nvidia RTX 4080 16GB. Even with that hardware, you’re still going to need to use AMD FSR2 at balanced settings to make up the extra frames. It also supports FSR3 and DLSS.\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nThe beefy Ultra specs are likely due to the game’s usage of “Raytraced global illumination, reflections & shadows.” It’s funny how the appreciable growth in graphical fidelity has decelerated significantly in the past couple of decades. If I were cynical, I’d think that a computational-heavy technique such as raytracing is so heavily pushed by tech companies as a way of ensuring that hardware still becomes obsolete at a consistent pace. I am cynical, so I do think that. But that's not Ubisoft's problem. They just want the bullet point. Ubisoft has other problems.\n\n\nHowever, if you are down for playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, your computer can have a bit of dust on it if you are okay with the lower settings. However, if you want to enjoy all the splendor that Ubisoft can bring to Pandora, you’ll need something with a little more beef.\n\n\nAvatar: Frontiers of Pandora will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on December 7, 2023.\n\nThe post You’ll need a beefy PC to see all the beauty of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over the years, there's been debate among fans about who fired the first nukes that kick-started the events of Fallout. Well, it looks as though this has been answered, as Tim Cain let the cat out of the vault, so to speak.\n\n\nIn a recent conversation with YouTube channel TKs-Mantis, Cain – who co-created the first two Fallout games – let it slip that China struck first. At around the 1:26:40 mark, he discusses the reason why America was nuked as part of the lore, related to how the US was creating an artificial virus known as FEV. It's then  China is mentioned in the conversation, basically confirming the country was the first to strike when the states refused to cooperate. \n\n\n\n\nHost Mantis then, with raised eyebrows, tells Cain that what he just said was \"earth-shattering.\" At this point, Cain becomes a little coy, seemingly unaware that Fallout fans were not sure who \"shot first,\" adding, \"Oh, well then I don't know... Who knows? It was probably some rogue nation.\"\n\n\nLet's hope there's no immediate fallout from this revelation\n\n\nLeonard Boyarsky – the other co-creator of the early Fallout entries – has gone on record saying that it doesn't really matter who launched the first attack. However, this recent slip up from Cain basically confirms what some may already have suspected.\n\n\nIn any case, it's a neat little bit of extra lore for those who are big into the post-apocalyptic franchise's universe. Who launched the first nuclear bombs is something that's been talked about for over two and a half decades. Now, it looks like we have closure.\n\n\nOn top of that, we've also recently learned that the Fallout TV show releases in April 2024. With the success of the Last of Us adaptation, others will no doubt be wanting to follow in those footsteps.\n\nThe post Fallout co-creator lets slip who shot first in the great nuke war appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite being an Epic Game Store exclusive, people have figured out how to play Alan Wake 2 on Valve's handheld. Though it is possible, poor performance means it's not necessarily a good idea. \n\n\nTo get Remedy's latest game running on the Steam Deck, you'll need to jump through a few hoops. Your first obstacle is the fact that the game is exclusive to the Epic Game Store launcher. To get around this, switch to Desktop mode then download the Epic Games Store launcher. You can then launch it from Steam by adding it to your library as a non-Steam game. \n\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Heroic Launcher which is an app that combines your libraries from a few launchers including EGS and GOG. Either way, once you've got your EGS library accessible on your Steam Deck, all that's left is to download Alan Wake 2 and play. You may need to download Proton tools to force compatibility. \n\n\nJust because you can do it, doesn't mean you should. Those who have gotten the game to run on the Deck don't report good performance. With settings at low, YouTuber Deck Wizard manages to have the game running at around 24FPS in the woods. Steam Deck Review and Tips' FPS sits in the low 20s as well. \n\n\nIt's no surprise that the Deck struggles to run the game, as it extremely demanding even on regular PCs. When the recommended PC specs were revealed, it shocked many, as DLSS is heavily relied upon. It is arguably worth it, as Alan Wake 2 is one of the best-looking games of the current generation. \n\n\nAlan Wake 2 isn't the only game released this year that the Deck struggles to run. It also had a hard time with Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3. \n\nThe post You can play Alan Wake 2 on the Steam Deck (but you shouldn’t) appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you've never played the original capers of special agent Joanna Dark, you can now check it out on PC.\n\n\nAlthough it's an unofficial port, GitHub user fgsfds has made Perfect Dark playable on PC, which not only brings the classic 2000 game back from the dead, but adds extra features. For example, mouselook, widescreen support, FOV, and more have been implemented.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo Life.\n\n\nThe download page notes the game is \"in a mostly functional state.\" Indeed, a report from DSO Gaming says the port does have some bugs, \"but not any game-breaking issues.\" The only thing you may need to consider is that it's only available on 32-bit operating systems. \n\n\nWhen Rare games weren't so rare\n\n\nPerfect Dark represents a grander time for developer Rare. Hot off the immense success of GoldenEye on the N64, the relatively small British studio was the darlings of a bygone Nintendo era.\n\n\nThe team is responsible for some of the most memorable games of the 90s. Setting standards with the release of Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, Rare consistently knocked it out of the park for years to come. Just ask anyone who remembers Banjo-Kazooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, or Killer Instinct.\n\n\nAs for Perfect Dark itself, the series has struggled to make much impact in more modern times. While there is a reboot in development, conflicts mean we might not see it for a good few years.\n\nThe post Classic N64 game Perfect Dark gets an unofficial PC port appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're about to gain access to even more retro classics on Switch (and several other platforms) come January. The Top Racer Collection features remastered SNES racing games to play, and it's set to launch on January 11, 2024 on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One/Series S|X, and Steam.\n\n\nThe Top Racer Collection will feature the popular ‘90s racing trilogy Top Gear, Top Gear 2, and Top Gear 3000. First hitting the shelves in 1992, the SNES high-speed racing series gained popularity among fans across the globe. Top Gear’s original Japanese title, Top Racer (a moniker that is now being ported over to the entire collection), is being adapted for the collection’s upcoming release. Although the series was competing with other popular racers such as Mario Kart and F-Zero, Top Gear still left an impact on the gaming industry.\n\n\nWith Top Gear being one of the most memorable racing trilogies in gaming history, fans will get a chance to play a wider range of classic racing games. Beyond that, they’ll also be able to enjoy the full Top Gear experience with newly implemented gameplay modes and filters. Both online and offline multiplayer modes will be available for players to choose from. And of course, the great soundtrack that accompanies the game will be featured as well.\n\n\n\n\nTop Gear meets Horizon Chase\n\n\nAlongside the Top Gear trilogy, an all-new collaboration game is coming as part of the collection. Top Racer Crossroads is a special crossover with Horizon Chase. The crossover is set to feature aspects of both games within the collection. This is a treat for Switch fans specifically: Nintendo already has a wide range of classic titles for fans to enjoy, but adding more SNES games to the platform any way possible is a great thing.\n\nThe post SNES Top Gear racing collection coming to multiple platforms, with a new game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sad news mobile enthusiasts...another popular game out of Japan is shuttering its servers. The game in question is SINoALICE developed by Pokelabo and published by SquareEnix, which originally launched in Japan in June 2017 and worldwide in July 2020. \n\n\nThe announcement (via Crunchyroll News) also states that the manga adaptation will conclude with the sixth volume, which will hit store shelves in Japan in January 2024. SquareEnix will release the fifth volume of the manga in English on November 23, 2023.  Along with the reveal of the game’s imminent closure, SINoALICE has also halted the sale of its premium currency. If you still have unused crystals, you can request a refund but fans are out of luck with already purchased items.\n\n\nThe global developer for SINoALICE, Nexon Korea Corporation, describes the roleplaying game as:\n\n\n\nSINoALICE is a chilling retelling of classic fairy tale within an unsettling dark fantasy world inspired by the game's creative director, Yokō Tarō (NieR:Automata). The game follows several popular fairy tale heroes as they work together to navigate perilous lands, battle menacing enemies and solve mind-bending puzzles to resurrect the storytellers that created them.\n\n\n\n\nWhen does SINoALICE shut down?\n\n\nFor those who are still active players of the game or want to check it out while you still have the chance, the global servers will deactivate on November 15. The DMM and browser versions of the game will be deactivated on December 26th, and finally, the service will end in Japan on January 15th. \n\n\nUnfortunately, SINoALICE only received mixed reviews upon its global release. While this will likely never be Yoko Taro's most memorable work, it might not be a bad idea to check out this title while you still can do so. This is especially true for those who enjoyed his previous projects, NieR and Drakengard.\n\nThe post SINoALICE Mobile Game to End Service and Manga by January appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There was a time when print media and pixel art were like peanut butter and jelly. Before the advent of polygon-based graphics and online storefronts, nearly every game was made from chunky grids of color, and at retail, every game came with a printed instruction manual showing how to play it.\n\n\nFlash forward to 2023, and the bulk of the world's biggest games are molded from three-dimensional shapes and are downloaded directly to hard drives. The mosaic beauty of dot art, and the tactile experience of turning a page in a book about that art, have both become niche enterprises. \n\n\nBut if there's one thing we've learned in games over the years, it's that even the tiniest niches can find ways to thrive. Believe it or not, even the mighty Minecraft was once a humble indie game only known to industry enthusiasts and insiders. And it's possible that Waneella, who contributed environmental art to games like River City Girls and Pocket Rumble, could break through in a similar way. She may not have her stuff sold in the toy section of Target any time soon, but I could see her work blowing up in the fine art world in the years to come. \n\n\nDecade is a new book from talented pixel artist Waneela\n\n\n\n\n\nA case in point is her current collaboration with Darren Wall (Read-only Memory, A Profound Waste of Time) on \"Decade,\" an artbook that collects ten years of her still pictures. Initially inspired by the pixel art of Superbrothers Sword and Sworcery EP, Waneella has since grown in popularity as an independent creator. Her compositions translate great to glowing screens, but bringing them to books makes even more sense. It's easy to picture people from all walks of life cozying up to a warm mug of the drink of their choice, cracking open her book, and being transported to places that sit somewhere between games and the real world, dreams, and reality. \n\n\nYou can find the Volume crowdfunding effort for it here!\n\nThe post River City Girls artist puts pixel art to print with new art book appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Creative side of Fortnite just got a new experience, courtesy of developer Torus Games and publisher Starbreeze Entertainment. Turtle vs Turtle sets two teams on top of moving platforms and puts them in a battle of base destruction. \n\n\nTurtle vs Turtle is essentially the Fortnite that you know and love with a slightly different hook. The game supports two teams of up to eight players. Each team gets a moving platform, and team members need to get to work building defenses and turrets. The goal is to keep your own platform stable and on the move while blasting your opponents’ to bits. \n\n\nBill McIntosh, CEO of Torus Games (LEGO 2K Drive, World War Z) released a statement saying: “Creating Turtle vs Turtle has been an exhilarating journey for us at Torus Games, and the support from Starbreeze has been pivotal in bringing our vision to life.” \n\n\nStarbreeze Entertainment, mostly a live service games publisher with titles like Roboquest and Payday 3, will be supporting Torus on Turtle vs Turtle as the game continues to evolve. \n\n\nScreenshot via Starbreeze Entertainment\n\n\nCreative 2.0\n\n\nThe game was built using Unreal Editor for Fortnite as part of the Creative system, which Epic released in March 2023. The toolset lets developers create new games inside Fortnite. It also lets them cash in on their work. Each month Epic pays a portion of its Fortnite revenue to creators based on player engagement with their games.\n\n\nStarbreeze's other recent live service release, Payday 3, debuted in September to mostly negative reception. Fans ran into frequent matchmaking problems and were frustrated by the game’s need for an internet connection even during solo play. An update addressing some of the issues has faced multiple delays.\n\n\nTurtle vs Turtle has a solid foundation as part of the Fortnite ecosystem, but Payday 3's rough start might make some reluctant to give it a shot. \n\nThe post Starbreeze and Torus Games launch a new island inside Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. \nIn the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. \nCheck out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSquare Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.\nKingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. \nFor more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes\nWhen host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.\nYou can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). \n\n\nWhether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.\nBeyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5.

But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.\nStrangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.\n#TheBatman suit is available for #ArkhamKnight via the Epic Games store\n@Venturian628) pic.twitter.com/pdTMYoNvWe\nOctober 26, 2023\nAt first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. \nThe Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. \nWhile we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight.

While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. \n\n\nVersion 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: \nAddressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed\nAddressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions\nAddressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright\nImproved stability\nDeveloper Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. \n\"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,\" it reads. \"We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error.

          "description": "In 2008, Robert Downey Jr. debuted as Tony Stark in Iron Man. Outside of being an excellent movie in its own right, Iron Man proved to be one of the most influential films of the 21st century so far, paving the way to the biggest film and TV franchise of the last decade and a half, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.\nAt the time, \"The Avenger Initiative\" felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity. Then, the announcement of the previously unthinkable: Th…",

It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today's Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. \nIn the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter's ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2's live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game's story. \nCheck out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAlan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT.

First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. \nA new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.\nThe open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. \n\n\nPlayers will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. \nThe open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.",

In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.\nWhile what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the \"first in-engine look.\" Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a \"pre-alpha footage\" tag.\nCheck out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. \nRevealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. \nHere are a few screenshots from today's showing: \n\nFor more Metal Gear, check out Game Informer's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 PlayStation 5 New Gameplay Today. \nAre you excited for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater?

A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.\nThe Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.\nNonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.",

Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. \nSome images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, \"Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.\"\nHey, @PlayStation & @cerny, we need to talk!\nhttps://t.co/GacpULuDu0 pic.twitter.com/IIF1iB2zgV\nOctober 25, 2023\nUnderstandably, many players and video game preservationists aren't enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it's unclear if it's required after that. \nGame Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. \nThe same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.\nFor more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won't come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.\nWhat do you think about this disc drive requiring an internet connection?

Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios' own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.\nOver the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO's The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.\nAre you excited for Amazon's Fallout series? Let us know in the comments!",

The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.\nThis feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless. \n\n\nWe’ve enjoyed our time with Peter and Miles, and you can read our thoughts by checking out our Spider-Man 2 review here.

The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.\nThe collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.\nWe had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Read our review if you want to know about all of that.  \nNotably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform).

As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.\nAs for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. \nCheck out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. \nBuying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. \nFor more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.\nAre you jumping into Ghostrunner 2 next week?

Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. \nSpeaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.\nCheck out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paradox Rift arrives on store shelves on November 3.
