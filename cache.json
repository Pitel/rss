          "description": "Not the Grimmest of outcomes.\nAbout a decade ago, Rooster Teeth launched a new anime web series called RWBY, which went on to spawn a reasonably successful media franchise. Yet—aside from a rather unfortunate hack ‘n’ slash game that bombed—RWBY’s only representation in video games consisted of a handful of mobile games and cameo appearances. In an effort to change this, a new project called RWBY: Arrowfell was announced in 2020, led by WayForward and Arc System Works. Now, nearly two years on, the game has finally seen a release and, well… it’s alright. Those waiting for the RWBY series to finally get a great video game adaptation will just have to keep waiting, but RWBY: Arrowfell is still a decent, if flawed, game.\nRWBY: Arrowfell is set sometime in the seventh volume of the anime, just after Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang have become officially licensed huntresses. While fulfilling quests while looking to make a name for themselves, they soon stumble upon a mysterious military technology that seems to attract Grimms and get caught up in a broader conspiracy as they investigate its origins. It’s not a particularly riveting story, but it provides just enough incentive to keep you engaged, buoyed in part by fully voice-acted cutscenes at key story beats that mimic the animation style of the show. Those of you with no background in RWBY may be a little lost sometimes as to how various characters and organizations are related to each other, but the narrative is kept simple enough that things don’t get too confusing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

To some, the games make a great leap from what has come before, with their open worlds and Let's Go mechanic making life that little bit easier, but for others the games don't go far enough to push the boat out - they remain too close to what precedes them.\nOne thing that has most certainly changed for Generation IX however, not that many will notice it, is the rare Pokémon disease Pokérus (or rather, the absence of it).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Games mostly don't do it justice at all, either making \"piracy\" shorthand for \"mindless omnicide for no reason\" or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.\nBuccaneers! isn't primarily a piracy game, but they're one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I'd call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier's Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It's probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.\nRead more",

Until then, you can play with your boomstick in co-op multiplayer schlockfest Evil Dead: The Game, and there's tactical role-player Dark Deity too. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "At some point since I played Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, a switch has flipped in me; I have gone from having stepped off the MCU train, content to watch it chug off into the distance with its remaining passengers, to actively wishing for its violent derailment. I'm saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.\nSpider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac's first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It's a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it's still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it's shorter.\nRead more",

Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto's seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. \nIn it, you play as Princess Euphora, who's on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It's not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I've seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya.

Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. 'Aha!' I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.\nFor those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.\nRead more",

We’ve seen the likes of Tolkien’s Middle-earth, Breath Of The Wild, Disneyland, Game of Thrones' Westeros, and the Star Wars universe all built block by block - and that’s only a short list of what you can find online. The creations you can find are honestly kind of amazing, and Minecraft builders are constantly putting out new masterpieces for fellow Minecrafters and non-crafters to oggle at all year round.\nRead more",

We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.\r\n\n\r\nStill, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option.

Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.\nLikewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.\nRead more",

It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. \nIts captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.\nRead more",

While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.\nSomerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.\nRead more",

I feel that's a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive's suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.\n\nGet the Crucial BX500 1TB for £56 (RRP £74)\n\nRead more",

Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost.

Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.\nAnyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.\nRead more",

It's a pixel platformer in which the protagonist, Pepper, has a drill which she uses to plow through scenery, and a grappling hook for all the moments when she's not underground. It's now been officially announced with Devolver as publisher and there's a reveal trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.\nRead more",

As it turns out, it’s an apt comparison. It feels like the logical conclusion to the original SNES title’s fixed-wing biplane challenges.\nI’m also something of a fan of flight sims, but have you noticed that there’s a dearth of arcade flight simulators?

Still, it's a snug suggestion that console players will be joining the war effort sooner rather than later, and most assuredly in 2023.\nThe newest entry in the acclaimed strategy series, Company of Heroes 3 will task armchair generals with guiding their highly trained platoons through the North African theater of war. The sequel boasts a new \"dynamic\" campaign mode, that will adjust itself for multiple playthroughs with a sandbox approach to its tactical action.

          "description": "Y'all here for Prehistory Rogue?\nNetflix has released a fun new trailer for its upcoming animated series Sonic Prime — And this particular preview has more than a hint of Multiverse Madness about it, as The Blue Blur finds himself hopping through time and space to confront wild variants of his friends, enemies, and worlds.\nOver the course of the two-minute preview Sonic blasts through past and future universes, each filled with its own unique hazards and dangers. But the real meat of the clip comes from the cool array of alternate pals that appear in the mix, from cybernetic versions of Tails and Amy Rose, to special forces variants of Knuckles and Rogue, and no less than five different Dr. Robotniks. My favorite is Prehistory Rogue, who confronts our hero accompanied by your favorite, Big the Cat.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rShZls4Ffw\nProduced by Canadian Studio WildBrain (Carmen Sandiego, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) and American producer Man of Action (Ultimate Spider-Man, Mega Man: Fully Charged), Sonic Prime promises 24 episodes of Gotta Go Fast action, featuring all of the characters both recognizable, (and, apparently, unrecognizable), from Sega's smash-hit video game franchise. Our lad Sonic has frequently proved himself a snug fit for animated antics, and hopefully, this new show will be no different.\nSonic Prime premieres exclusively on Netflix on December 15. Back in the digital world, Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post New Sonic Prime trailer takes a trip through time and space appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even if you don’t count any spinoff titles and lump all dual releases together (ie Red and Blue), you still have over 20 games to choose from. If you can’t count the entries in a series on your fingers and toes, there are officially too many for a new person to consider.\nFortunately, the Pokémon formula is so timeless that virtually every mainline game is a good starting point. That said, the series has plenty of peaks and valleys, and some of those peaks are truly spectacular.

Boasting an original storyline set after the events of Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Squadrons puts players in dual roles as members of both The New Republic and The Galactic Empire, both of which are tasked with the creation or destruction of a devastating new vessel known as Project Starhawk.\nStar Wars Squadrons features a full story campaign as well as several multiple modes, and allows players to pilot an array of famous ships such as the X-Wing, the B-Wing, the TIE Fighter, and the TIE Bomber. Stars Wars Squadrons received moderate praise for its visuals and authenticity to the Star Wars universe, though some lauded the title's unfulfilling \"work against yourself\" story mode, as well as a general lack of content.\nStar Wars Squadrons is available to download from Epic Games Store on November 24.

The sale will end November 28.]\nThe dedicated king of PlayStation Plus leaks, Dealabs author billbil-kun, has suggested that the black-and-blue brand is preparing to offer a meaty 25% discount on its range of PS Plus paid subscription services — The discount is expected to arrive as part of the forthcoming Black Friday madness.\nAccording to the veteran PS leaker, PlayStation users will be able to pick up 12-month PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscriptions at a quarter of their original price, provided that they are bagged between November 18-28. As a quick refresher, Essential offers monthly free titles and online capabilities, Extra throws in access to a catalog of rotating titles, while Premium users also receive access to the PlayStation Classics range, as well as exclusive demos and trials.\nWith a 25% discount included, PlayStation owners can expect the following prices in the rumored offer:\nPlayStation Plus Essential (12 Month) - $44.99 / €44.99 / £37.49\nPlayStation Plus Extra (12 Month) – $74.99 / €74.99 / £62.99\nPlayStation Plus Premium (12 Month) – $89.99 / €89.99 / £74.99\nAdmittedly, in financially tough times such as these, 80 buckeroos for a gaming subscription is still a pretty hefty ask. But if you're the type of player to burn through games with reckless abandon, then having access to a constantly rotating catalog of releases across 2023 will, ultimately, pay for itself.\nOf course, there is no official word the deal is definitely happening. But, given Dealabs consistent accuracy when revealing PlayStation Plus titles, this Black Friday discount rumor can probably be filed under \"concrete\".\nThe post PlayStation Plus to receive 25% discount for Black Friday (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, you'll have to hold off on that!

Here's the disclaimer: \"Note: The Pokemon you’ll be able transfer to each game via Pokemon HOME are limited to Pokemon that can appear in those games. Please look out for more information about which Pokemon will be available in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet.\"\nBefore then, there is something coming sooner. That same post explains that in \"early 2023,\" the pair of games are getting \"Battle Stadium statistics\" support: \"From the app, you’ll be able to view information about Trainer rankings, frequently used Pokémon, Online Competitions, and more. You’ll also be able to see what moves, Abilities, and held items are being used in battles the most.\"\nIt's unfortunate that the rollout is so far away, but it also allows for some time for the current generation to marinate and sink in, without tons of different metas emerging.

As Princess Euphora watches the evil general annihilate the fleet, the crew jets off into space, seeking salvation at the Forever Star with a plucky crew, hanging by a thread.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mitPu7bcDB8\nIf you're reminded of the days of '70s anime, that's not an accident. League of Geeks specifically cites Star Blazers, the animated adaptation of anime series Space Battleship Yamato, as an inspiration. And according to the Steam page, there may be some smooth '70s Tokyo disco in the mix, too.\nFly me to the moon\nWhile the trailer gives a good look at the style, inspiration, and setting for this adventure, the Steam page holds some more info on the actual gameplay of this \"FTL-meets-Star Blazers\" hybrid.\nAs the captain escaping the warmongering Zutopans, you'll have to keep the starship running while making your way to the Forever Star. This means managing needs, repairing damage, and keeping an eye on those aboard the ship.\n\nCrewmates can act out a sort of \"floating melodrama\" thanks to their moods, allowing relationships and incidents to arise. Keep Hope alive, literally, and it'll keep your boat afloat.\nDifferent biomes and hazards, emergent disasters, and hostile ships all act to keep you from your goal. But this seems like a cool mix of spaceship sim and management, with an infectious nostalgia for the classics. Alongside League of Geeks' other project, a remake of Solium Infernum, the team is putting together some great-looking throwbacks. Here's hoping they both stick the landing next year.\nThe post Jumplight Odyssey is a blend of spaceship management and classic anime appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a must-play if you like story-driven games or point and click adventures, and it's honestly a crime that it wasn't nominated for Best Narrative at the Game Awards, because the writing is absolutely gorgeous. NORCO has been out since March, but the game's developer Geography of Robots just announced today via Twitter that the southern gothic adventure is now available to play on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.\nNaturally, the game's controls were entirely reworked for controller instead of mouse and keyboard, and the devs also confirmed in the Twitter thread that the PC version of the game also has controller support now. They even included a helpful graphic that breaks down how the control scheme will work on a PlayStation Dualshock. Basically, you can either use the left stick as a virtual mouse, or simply use the D-pad to select \"hotspots or other UI elements.\" Big win for controller simps like me.\nhttps://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1593265507939098625\nFor those who may not know what to expect from NORCO's gameplay, Geography of Robots describes it pretty well in yet another tweet:\n\"Gameplay-wise, it resembles classic first-person text-based pixel adventures like Snatcher, Deja Vu, Policenauts, VA-11 HA-11 A, Read Only Memories, Circuit's Edge, Rise of the Dragon, etc. There are also combat minigames. You can automate them if you want.\"\nNORCO is one of those games that I enjoyed so much that I want to buy it on another platform, and I have to admit I'm enticed by the idea of playing it on a bigger screen. Regardless of any awards, it's one of the most stylish, thoughtful indie games of recent memory, and I think in the long run, it'll stick around.\nThe post Best Narrative snub NORCO is now available for consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

This new speed increase can also be applied to battles themselves, with a \"Speed Up\" toggle allowing for quick and easy carvings in face-to-face encounters. Hopefully, these two new additions will make grinding for XP less of a chore.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5GhQxUiVg\nFour new demons have been added to the Soul Hackers 2 roster via this new update. The demons are the fiery Aitvaras, the stoic priestess Isis, the frankly bizarre Neko Shotgun, and the hyper-iconic Pixie — depicted in her original Devil Summoner form. It should be noted that acquiring these new demons does not count toward the in-game Registration Percentage of the Demon Compendium, nor its associated achievements or trophies.\nFinally, a small run of tweaks and bug fixes should improve loading times across the board, while other changes streamline the shop experience, and include new preventative measures to stop button mashers from accidentally selecting the wrong options while plowing through the game's many menu screens.

Thus, button mashes can land decent combos from jump-ins and at close range, while applying pressure with projectiles and other moves from range. The system will adjust to the opponent's position, offering up attack strings as best fit the present state.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_47kMYeu4\nObviously, such a system would be a bit of an advantage in online play, (although, frankly, a great player could probably still defend against it with ease), ad so Dynamic controls will be locked to offline play only. But for family feuds, drunken slap fights, or just getting together with friends for a quick mash fest, Dynamic controls represents one more way that Street Fighter 6 is going above and beyond to be one of the most accessible and playable series entries for every fighter who wants to step into the ring.\nNow, can we please have a few more character trailers?.. Pretty please?\nStreet Fighter 6 launches 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

          "description": "We have a \"winter\" and \"spring\" update planned so far\nYesterday, Capcom unveiled some details for \"Title Update 3,\" which will be arriving in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak later this month. There's a lot of interesting stuff in there (that you can read about here!), but the publisher also managed to tease out future content as well.\nAt the end of their Title Update 3 video, Capcom gave us insight into what the future of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak will entail. Following Free Title Update 3, we're moving on to Free Title Update 4, which is in \"winter\" of 2023 (so before the end of Q1). It's billed as \"version .14,\" and includes an Elder Dragon appearance, as well as a \"powered-up monster.\" No doubt there will be more paid DLC, tweaks, and quality of life changes too.\nAfter that, we got a second tease for a \"spring\" 2023 update, which is predictably called Free Title Update 5 (version .15). No broad details were given about it, but it'll likely include content similar to what we've seen in the past.\nI'm glad that this model still exists, as live service games with paid season passes dominate the landscape. While the practice isn't necessarily bad if done correctly: publishers can't help themselves, and screw up decent games beyond recognition because of the monetiaztion model. Keeping Rise as a premium game with an expansion and free title updates has maintained its general quality.\nThe post Here is the Monster Hunter Rise 2023 roadmap appeared first on Destructoid.",

Most pointedly, Zhu singles out an unnamed \"jerk\" at Activision Blizzard for, in Zhu's opinion, causing damage to the relationship.\n\"As a gamer who spent 10,000 hours in the world of Azeroth, Starcraft and Overwatch, I feel so heartbroken as I will no longer have the access to my account and memories next year,\" began Zhu. \"One day, when what has happened behind the scene could be told, developers and gamers will have a whole new level [of] understanding of how much damage a jerk can make.\"\n\"Feel terrible for players who lived in those worlds.\"\nAs we reported earlier, Blizzard Entertainment will suspend service to its range of IPs in the China region, formerly distributed by NetEase. This includes hugely popular titles such as World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, and Overwatch.

The two companies have been unable to negotiate new terms for a contract extension, and thus Blizzard will be taking the severe step of suspending service for all of its online titles — including World of Warcraft, Warcraft III: Reforged, Hearthstone, Diablo III, Diablo: Immortal, StarCraft, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm.\nAccording to an official statement by the publisher, the Chinese release of Overwatch 2, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, and Hearthstone: March of the Lich King \"will proceed later this year\". Blizzard Entertainment will continue to see a new publishing partner in the highly lucrative market.\n\nNetEase has handled Blizzard Entertainment's output in China since way back in 2008, so this decision is quite surprising. Additional reporting by Bloomberg suggests that the failed contract negotiations were not just a matter of money, but also disputes on how to handle player data and general IP management. No doubt the news will also come as a major shock to the many Chinese esports players/teams that have built their brand around Blizzard games.\n\"We’re immensely grateful for the passion our Chinese community has shown throughout the nearly 20 years we’ve been bringing our games to China through NetEase and other partners,\" said Blizzard President Mike Ybarra. \"Their enthusiasm and creativity inspire us, and we are looking for alternatives to bring our games back to players in the future.\"\nYou can read Activision Blizzard's official statement on the matter on the studio's website.\nNetEase president Simon Zhu made his candid thoughts very clear on LinkedIn.\nThe post Blizzard Entertainment to suspend game services in China appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a new interview, Santa Monica Studios' Cory Barlog says the studio is currently spread out across a lot of different things.\nSpeaking to the Los Angeles Times, Barlog says Sony Santa Monica Studio is currently \"spread out on a lot of different things.\" The director declines to specify what those are. But as the LA Times points out, there were rumors of a sci-fi project at the studio that was cancelled. Sony Santa Monica has also helped publish games in the past, like Journey.\nSanta Monica Studio just launched God of War Ragnarok. the follow-up to the 2018 God of War reboot. And as Ragnarok director Eric Williams puts it, being the God of War studio isn't a bad thing.\n“I remember talking to someone from another game company, where they were trying to get me to leave,\" Williams told the LA Times. \"They said, 'Do you just want to be known as the God of War guy for the rest of your life?' That was your big pitch to dissuade me? Because yes, I kind of do.”\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E\nAncient myths and new legends\nConsidering the studio just wrapped one big game, expecting something new right away wouldn't make much sense. The studio has yet to announce its next project, but that's kind of like asking someone who just finished a marathon about tomorrow's run.\nMeanwhile, studio has been clear that Ragnarok is the end of the Norse saga for Kratos and crew. Whatever's next seems like it'll be a new step forward in some way.\nThe post Sony Santa Monica Studio is currently ‘spread out on a lot of different things’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cyberpunk's first DLC is right around the corner\nFans of CD Projekt Red's most recent release, Cyberpunk 2077, have been waiting quite some time now to learn some more information about the game's first official DLC: Phantom Liberty. News of the spy thriller expansion was first released back in September via a teaser trailer, and we know it's scheduled to drop sometime in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S (Stadia is also listed as a platform for release in the official Cyberpunk website's blog post from a few months ago, but I have a feeling that one is subject to change).\nWhile news of a more specific release window is up in the air, we do have confirmation as of today that Phantom Liberty will be paid DLC expansion, but we don't know how much it'll be yet, either. Paying for DLC is something that CD Projekt fans know well (just look at The Witcher 3), and if I had to guess based on precedence, I'd say this new expansion should be somewhere around $20 depending on how big it is. In a comment to GamesRadar+, the global PR director for CDPR, Radek Grabowski, said that the expansions are \"traditionally cheaper than full-price games,\" so at the very least we know it won't be $60. We'll take what we can get at this point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbVKBoDuhZ0\nThis likely won't be the only DLC we see for Cyberpunk, either, but if you ask me a spy thriller theme is a great place to start. I imagine the adventure will have something to do with corporate espionage, and if we're basing predictions on the past Witcher DLC, there's a good chance we could see new maps and characters, and even get a whole new synth-style soundtrack. I for one will be excited to see what comes next for Night City, especially after the renewed hype for the game from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime.\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is confirmed as a paid DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

          "description": "Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms.

And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. \nThis news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. \n\n\n\"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,\" Wingefores said in the statement. \"The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1.

It's a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn't too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. \nHere's the full statement on the delay: \nWhile waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game's procedurally generated gore system. \nAre you excited for Dead Island 2?

The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. \nFor fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.\nPlayers represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

          "description": "The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. \nMore specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. \nUnfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. \nIf it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you tuning into the finale event for Fortnite Chapter 3?

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",

For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.
