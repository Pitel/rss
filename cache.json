Not by the government, but by the only force in King City that matters – The Company. Capes takes the turn-based strategy genre and gives it a comic book feel, putting you in the control of a fledgling group of superheroes trying to dish out justice in a city where justice doesn’t exist. While some of its visuals lack a bit of polish, the actual gameplay in Capes is heroic enough to make up for it.\nIf you throw The Boys and Watchmen into a blender with XCOM 2, what you’d be left with would be Capes. Developer Spitfire Interactive knew exactly the tone it was going for and stuck with it. You start with two superheroes and a grizzled veteran calling the shots from a bunker and slowly assemble a team capable of freeing King City from the grip of The Company, which is so evil it doesn’t need a proper name.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.\nRead more",

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It's dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter. It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.\nRead more",

Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like. I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires.

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

          "description": "Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

The interests of the game's creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.\nRead more",

He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his.

          "description": "My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam's acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

My leg-snappin' plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.\nRead more",

A bunch of players are competing to cross the finish line of a brutally difficult tower of racetracks in racing game Trackmania, with a prize pool of $30,000 waiting for the first three drivers to reach the top. The course is a huge, winding gauntlet made of pieces suspended in midair, and even expert players have fallen from their positions over 1000 times, their cars hurtling back to the bottom of the tower to start again. The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising.

Its nomer has now become a misnomer.\n\n\nThe new roomisode features the eponymous Dangeresque’s counterweight Dangeresque Too as he fights the fickle stubbornness of elevator doors using adventure game logic. That’s all I got, about the new episode, so here are the bullet points from the release:\n\n\n\nUm, more puzzles\n\n\nUhh, more cutscenes\n\n\nMore entertaining ways to die\n\n\nSingle click interface! Dangeresque Too doesn't mess about with Talk and Look!\n\n\nNew Achievements\n\n\n\nAs legend has it, Dangeresque: The Roomisode came out in 2008 around the time of the blockbuster Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People. Last year, the newly resurr-awoken Videlectrix remastered and re-released it with two new Roomisodes stapled on.\n\n\nImage via Videlectrix\n\n\nIt’s really good! If I can talk real here, the fact that Videlectrix squished down the point-and-click formula to fit in one room (later three) is quite the design flex. Take that, doors. We don’t need you.\n\n\nThe new Roomisode, Roomisode X was teased way, way back a few months ago when my life peaked and I interviewed the Brothers Chaps. That was a fun time. Let's all reflect on that for a while.\n\n\nDangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is available on PC and Linux. Roomisode X should have been glued on there by now.\n\nThe post Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate becomes a Quadrungulate with a free new Roomisode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "HBO has tapped Jeffrey Wright to reprise his in-game role of Isaac in The Last of Us Season 2. He's not the first actor to return to the same role they had in the video game, but it's a pleasing trend to see the series continuing nonetheless.\n\n\nWright played Isaac Dixon in The Last of Us Part II, which launched on the PlayStation 4 in 2020. Isaac, for those who may not recall, is the leader of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF). The group stands opposite another in-game faction, the Seraphites, often referred to as \"Scars.\" Both groups were antagonistic forces to Ellie and her allies, with the cultish Scars being particularly brutal.\n\n\n\n\nWright returns to reprise his role from the game\n\n\nIn the game, the WLF made the decaying ruins of Seattle its home turf. Battles between the group and the Seraphites raged on until the two managed a shaky truce. Abby, the deuteragonist of the game, was part of the WLF. If the show follows along with the events of the game, we'll likely see the WLF and its calculating leader not long after Seattle gets thrown under the spotlight.\n\n\nAs mentioned, Wright certainly isn't the first actor to join The Last of Us series as the character they portrayed in the game. Merle Dandridge reprised her role as Marlene, the Firefly commander who tasked Joel to transport Ellie in The Last of Us Part I. Both Troy Baker, who voiced Joel in the game, and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Ellie, also made an appearance in the first season but not as their characters.\n\n\nImage via Max\n\n\nWright will appear alongside Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, who return as Joel and Ellie, respectively. They will also be joined by Catherine O'Hara in an unknown role. \n\n\nThe Last of Us Season 2 doesn't have a premiere date yet, but is scheduled to arrive on HBO and Max in 2025.\n\nThe post The Last of Us season 2 brings in Jeffrey Wright to reprise his role as Isaac appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Entrati Lanthorn is a newer resource found in Warframe, encountered as you dip into later game content. It comes in handy for crafting all sorts of items from the Zariman and the Murmur areas.\n\n\nEntrari Lanthorn farming is possible in a few locations. So, here's a handy list of where you can find Entrati Lanthorn in Warframe, along with drop rates. \n\n\nHow to get an Entrati Lanthorn in Warframe\n\n\nTo get an Entrati Lanthorn, you have to partake in the following activities to have a chance of getting the resource. We’ll break it down from the planet, node, rotation, and percentage of it dropping.\n\n\nPlanet / Node\nRotation / Tier\nDrop Chance\n\n\nDeimos - Persto\nB\n5%\n\n\nDeimos - Cambire \nB\n5%\n\n\nDeimos - Munio\nB\n5%\n\n\nZariman - Everview Arc\nB\n6.67%\n\n\nZariman - Halako Perimeter\nMission completion\n10%\n\n\nZariman - Tuvul Commons\nB\n6.67%\n\n\nZariman - Oro Works\nB\n6.67%\n\n\nZariman - The Greenway\nMission completion\n10%\n\n\nZariman Bounty \nT1 - Final Stage\n4.35%\n\n\nZariman Bounty (3x)\nT2 - Final Stage\n3.39%\n\n\nZariman Bounty (3x)\nT3 - Final Stage\n7.94%\n\n\nEntrati Netracells\nMission completion\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest farm for Entrati Lanthorn\n\n\nTo most efficiently farm the Entrati Lanthorn, you could take a crack at The Greenway or Halako Perimeter in the Zariman. They both have a 10% chance of giving you the resource at the end of the mission. Though, the faster mission is Halako just because it’s an Exterminate. \n\n\nUnless you’re very far into the game and have a strong build to withstand enemies above level 200, the better farm is to play the weekly Netracell missions. Upon completing the mission and breaking the container to get the weekly reward, you’re given a guaranteed Entrati Lanthorn. \n\n\nYou can only receive five of these a week since there are only five tries. Though, you can also use these changes for the Deep Archimedea mode and still get them there as end-of-mission rewards.\n\nThe post How to farm Entrati Lanthorn in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players appreciated the feature because it provided the perfect testing zone for players to experiment with loadouts and get comfortable with settings. However, when the title launched, the game mode was no longer available. \n\n\nAfter a few days of confusion, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin confirmed that the Practice Zone would be included in an update soon.

          "description": "Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

          "description": "Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, \"I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.\"\nThe interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"\nHe also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.\nYou can read the full interview here.

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.\nThe franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.",

This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens.

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule. \nWhat do you think this new iteration will be?

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

          "description": "Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nSimilar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills\nThe Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",
