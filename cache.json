I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.\r\n\n\r\nSunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That's how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring's major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.\nYet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.\nRead more",

Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.\r\n\n\r\nOK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead?

          "description": "Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I'm happy to report that game is now out in early access. It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).\nIn the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.\nRead more",

We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.\r\n\n\r\nThat said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex.

I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.\r\n\n\r\nMaybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.\nRead more",

So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.\nRead more",

Sounds like my freshman year!\" and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It's also tempting to say something like, \"You know Two Point Hospital? It's like that, but at a university,\" but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.\nRead more",

Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.\nI'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.\nRead more",

          "description": "Měsíc utekl lusknutím prstu a krom konference InstallFest se nám přiblížila i další Virtuální Bastlírna. Chcete vědět, co za zajímavé novinky a zvláštní témata jsme pro Vás našli tentokrát?\r\n\r\nI když se to nezdá jako reálná možnost, ukážeme Vám, jak použít globální síť FindMyIphone gigantu Apple pro monitoring stavu Vaší poštovní schránky. Podíváme se také na hrozivou elektroinstalaci z facebookových videí a pro milovníky vintage audiotechniky ukážeme krásnou studii NASA zabývající se důvody selhání starých tranzistorů. A samozřejmě mnoho dalšího...\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 2. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00. Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo si chcete jenom popovídat, dorazte, jste srdečně vítáni! Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Time to break some eggs\nThe next Dragon Age game officially has a subtitle. BioWare confirms today that the next game in the series will be officially titled Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.\nAs the title and previous teasers have heavily implied, former party member Solas will be playing a big role in Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. He is, himself, the Dread Wolf who can be seen as a betrayer or savior, depending on your world view.\nEither way, the story of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC firmly set him up as the next big bad in Thedas. Whatever's next for the realm, it's sure to involve the trickster god in some way.\nInterestingly enough, BioWare indicates that newcomers will be able to jump right into Dragon Age with Dreadwolf. \"If you're new to Dragon Age, you have no need to worry about not having met our antagonist just yet,\" today's announcement reads. He will introduce himself to the player when the \"time is right.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1532406453071319045\nThe Dreadwolf rises\nThat's all the information we received today on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. BioWare confirms the next Dragon Age is not coming this year, though we are \"growing closer\" to the next adventure. The studio says it will be talking more about the game later this year.\nBioWare has previously said it's still in production on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, so it's little surprise that its next big RPG isn't arriving this year. It's nice to have a subtitle too, so I can stop referring to it solely as \"the next Dragon Age.\"\nStill, I'm curious to see what the crew is up to, especially following the comment about newcomers. The Dragon Age games have historically carried save data and decisions across games. BioWare even developed an online tool for previous games to craft world states for players.\nI'm interested to see if, and how, that carryover will be handled with Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. We'll see what Solas has in store later this year.\nThe post The next Dragon Age is officially titled Dragon Age: Dreadwolf appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mushroom Kingdom comes to Hollywood\nWhen Universal Studios Japan announced the new Super Nintendo World a few years back, gamers lost their collective minds. Sure, we're used to seeing our favorite films and TV shows come to life at a theme park, but seeing a game world realized is a brand new feeling. I'm honestly shocked it took them this long, considering how well-loved, imaginative, and easily-marketable video game settings are — especially when it comes to Nintendo properties. Now, Universal is finally moving the ball down the field, because its Hollywood park is getting its very own highly-anticipated Super Nintendo World.\nWe knew Mario and his friends were headed our way soon, but a tweet this morning from the official Universal Studios Hollywood confirmed that the new land would be opening sometime in early 2023. A follow-up tweet also provides a short trailer for one of the upcoming main attractions of Super Nintendo World: an interactive ride called Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge.\nhttps://twitter.com/UniStudios/status/1532394497161797635\nThe video shows off the ride vehicles, which are themed to look exactly like the go-karts in the game, as well as a little bit of what the actual ride experience will be like. Riders look to be equipped with glasses of some kind, and while we don't have any confirmation on the nature of what they do just yet, it looks like they combine alternate reality elements with physical set dressing on the ride to make for a fully immersive experience.\nI'm lucky enough to currently live in Los Angeles, so you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be checking this out opening weekend. I was super bummed that I wouldn't be able to see the one in Japan, so I'm thrilled to see that it's coming to the states now, too. It will be interesting to see how similar it is to the original park, or if they expand at all outside of the Mario Bros. IP.\nThe post Super Nintendo World is coming to Universal Studios Hollywood in early 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It starts in Minneapolis in a week, then ends in Seattle\nA Nintendo Switch Road Trip tour is coming to the US, starting on June 10 through September 5. The gist is that Nintendo will allow people to play select games (Nintendo Switch Sports, Mario Strikers, Kirby and the Forgotten Land), and potentially pick up SWAG and other bonuses (these aren't guaranteed, but having been to a few of these before, getting stuff like buttons/stickers are possible).\nThe event kicks off in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 10 through June 13. From there it'll head across the US in various cities, ending in Seattle, Washington on September 5. Here's the list of locations, and the rundown of full dates and venues can be found here:\nMinneapolis, MN\nDenver, CO\nMilwaukee, WI\nChicago, IL\nSan Diego, CA\nBethlehem, PA\nRaleigh-Durham, NC\nLos Angeles, CA\nSeattle, WA\nSo there's a few tips I discovered here when researching the event. While Nintendo says you don't need to register for it, you can \"secure a spot\" here with the Warp Pipe Pass system: in case anything goes wrong or they're at capacity, you should be good. Plan to spend \"30-40 minutes\" to finish the event per person, \"not including any wait time.\"\nAlso note that there is a QR code bonus program. If you have a Nintendo event coordinator scan your code, you can pick up 100 Platinum Points. You can find instructions for accessing your unique QR code here. Note that the process will take you directly to your Nintendo account.\nOh, and bring \"appropriate footwear\" to play Switch Sports! Out of all the games, that's the one I'd want to try the most in a controlled, open setting, with plenty of room for four or more people to stretch their arms out.\nThe post There’s a Nintendo Switch Road Trip coming to select US cities appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Visual spoilers\nIf you haven't seen this Elden Ring boss size comparison video yet, it's definitely worth a watch. After you've finished the game, of course!\nIf you've been avoiding spoilers, here's a text shield! Also I made sure the header image just featured what basically amount to regular enemies, and not major bosses. In any case, the video just walks by lifeless models of the bosses, and no fights are shown until the very end.\nCrafted by the Garden of Eyes YouTube channel, this one came across my desk thanks to a reader, and despite the fact that it came out in May, it still holds up as an evergreen testament to just how ridiculously large some of the bosses in Elden Ring are. Clocking in at just over eight minutes long, the video takes a player character across a boss plane, with every major enemy model on display in a line.\nIt starts at what amounts to minibosses (beefed-up regular enemies that double as crypt encounters), then quickly escalates from there. What's fascinating is that I distinctly remember each and every one of these battles, but I had no idea that, say, a Godskin enemy was taller than a lot of other bosses in the game. The big shocker though? Seeing how big Elder Dragon Greyoll (that thing you don't really fight so much as kill as it lays on the ground) really is.\nLike all Elden Ring videos, this just makes me want to play it again — but having played once more even after getting the platinum, I think I'll focus on other games for a while!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33qNxr24DIg\nThe post This Elden Ring boss size comparison video is hilarious appeared first on Destructoid.",

Meaning, if you're in the year 2061 (whether through internal clock shenanigans or in nearly 40 years), Animal Crossing: New Horizons refuses to boot up.\nObviously this is something that will probably be patched by Nintendo (or, if you're actually reading this in 2061, you can just set your clock back), but it has really interesting and entertaining implications. I mean, where will we be in roughly 40 years? Will the Switch still be as reliable? What happens if by and large, most Switch units drift? Nintendo will likely cease repairs sometime in 2030, so folks will have to seek repairs elsewhere, or hope that the \"next Switch\" supports backward compatibility.\nIt's a fun thought exercise for something that won't matter for four decades or so. But in the context of game preservation, with so many projects becoming live service-oriented or veering toward soft or hard online requirements: it's always worth pondering.\nThe post It looks like Animal Crossing: New Horizons won’t work in the year 2061 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it currently errors out if you try and download/access it, the listing clearly points to a demo reveal that will likely happen in the near future, so keep an eye out for it: especially if you pre-ordered already.\nTypically, Warriors demos involve several early stages, potential access to the world map, and the ability to free play until a certain point in the game. At that point, you should be able to carry over progress into the full version. So for fans, it should be a meaty dive into what Three Hopes has to offer, and provide a glimpse into the new take on the storyline, as well as any potential gameplay adjustments.\nOf course, it'll also be an important showcase for something that's deeply impacted Warriors games, especially on Switch: performance. While some can live with framerate issues, others can't, and Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo will need to put its best foot forward if it wants to sell more people on the game leading up to launch. Performance hasn't stopped Omega Force and company before, though!\nAgain, when it goes live, you'll find it here, or on the eShop proper.\nThe post Listing pops up for a Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sorry, Mr. Caffeine fans...\nToday will see Sony host a brand new State of Play presentation, kicking off what is expected to be another long summer of online showcases and news streaming events — in lieu of the still missing-in-action E3. However, it seems that one of the industry's biggest publishers will not be joining the party, as Ubisoft has announced that it has no live stream on deck for the coming month.\nSpeaking in brief comments to Axios, Ubisoft noted that it would be foregoing its usually summer presentation, and instead expects to hold its next major live stream, Ubisoft Connect, \"later this year.\" This will mark the first time in some years that the Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, and Rainbow Six Siege publisher has not put in a showing during what would usually be \"E3 month.\"\nIt should also be noted that Ubisoft did not feature on Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest partner list, a who's who of industry names that included Capcom, Atlus, Sega, PlayStation, Warner Bros., Xbox, 2K Games, and many other globally successful developers and publishers. One might assume that Ubisoft is not quite ready to reveal further details on its upcoming releases, including the development-limbo sequel Beyond Good and Evil 2, and smaller projects such as the Prince of Persia remake and Assassin's Creed Rift.\nWhile there is no doubt that the coming months will see a vast amount of headlines, trailers, game reveals, and exciting updates, this summer's gaming extravaganza is looking a dot quieter than previous years, with companies such as EA choosing to mix their announcements in with larger shows, rather than hold their own individual live streams. This will be better in the long run for everybody, respecting the time of both audiences and the media, while allowing a tighter focus on each publisher's bigger releases over needlessly drawn-out theatrical segments.\nThe post Ubisoft will not be hosting any live stream presentations this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

All three titles will be available to add to your library until July 5.]\nIn what has now become a regular monthly event, the next PlayStation Plus offerings have been leaked ahead of their official announcement — As noted by regular spoiler billbil-kun of Dealabs, June will see PS Plus subscribers bag themselves copies of Sony's God of War, Gamemill's Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Bandai Namco's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np1jPkg3R6Q\nAssuming that the leak is genuine, (and there's very little reason to believe it isn't), the three titles will be available to download from June 7 until July 5.

The new service offers three distinct subscription tiers — Essentials, Extra and Premium — which will afford access to a rotating library of PlayStation releases on PS5, PS4, PS2, and the original PlayStation, dependent on your membership. Sony will continue to offer up a monthly selection of \"to-keep\" titles for all subscribers, regardless of their respective subscription tier.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ypgtAyjSCo\nFor more information on the new PlayStation Plus service, see our previous report right here.\nThe post June’s PlayStation Plus games include God of War and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bring intergalactic chaos to five large, open-world maps, including Bay City, Albion, Takoshima, Tunguska, and even the far reaches of The Moon. Battle raging hippies, the KGB, and other flared monstrosities across a day-glo decade that broke all of the rules.\nhttps://youtu.be/XEDy9365LCA\nTHQ Nordic lifted the lid on three editions of Destroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed. Because why release anything if you can't make it a little more complicated? The standard edition of the game will launch for $39.99 USD on all platforms, while a \"Dressed to Skill\" edition throws in a selection of DLC skins and challenge missions for $54.99. Finally, a physical collector's edition will also include a selection of as-yet-unannounced gubbins, and will retail for a staggering $399. It better include a working jetpack.\nPre-orders for all editions are now live, and anybody pre-ordering any of the versions will unlock immediate access to the multiplayer standalone title, Destroy All Humans! Clone Carnage. For those of you who aren't quite ready to commit to purchasing DAH!2: Reprobed just yet, then DAH!: Clone Carnage is also available to purchase separately, priced at $12.99.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsoxUVgji4I\nDestroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed launches August 30 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed invades PS5, PC, and Xbox Series August 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "All four karts and Switch units safely housed in one place\nNearly two years ago when Mario Kart Live arrived, I said that what you got out of it will vary from household to household, and that rings true to this day. And it looks like Reddit user fiveonthakush got a lot out of it with this Mario Kart Live setup.\nTheir case is a masterpiece, in that it holds four playable karts, as well as four units of Switch hardware: which double as the controllers and screen in which to view the karts as they race around a real-life \"track.\" All they'd need to do is keep the Switches charged, then carry it anywhere they want for some family fun.\nThe creator says the case is from mycasebuilder.com, designed with \"lower foam,\" which they cut out based on the specifications, with a \"routed lid\" to ensure that the top didn't tightly press down on the karts and the Switch hardware. Interestingly, they \"swapped parts on the karts\" so they could tell all four apart. If you look closely, there's a green kart with a red \"Mario\" M on it, and a red kart with a red Mario M: vice versa for two karts that feature Luigi. That way you can more easily tell who \"players one through four\" are. They say that they hope to get even more use out of the game because of the case, which makes it easier to transport: and had fun putting the set together.\nWith that said, it's sad that Velan Studios/Nintendo never released proper \"player three or player four\" karts: but for Nintendo's experimentation, a lack of follow-through is par for the course (RIP Labo?). I know there is a community around the game, and I hope it gets some sort of follow-up someday.\nThe post This Mario Kart Live setup is extremely cool appeared first on Destructoid.",

The developer made the announcement in a statement to the press this week.\n\"We are reintroducing the apostrophe and the space between the words to truly embrace the meaning of DON’T NOD. DON’T NOD is two words to represent our tendency to be non-conventional as a company and in the games that we create — as in, we DON’T NOD along to everyone else’s tune,\" writes the newly named company. \"The D [in our logo] is shattered, and the N appears within it, signifying that we are not afraid to break the mold. This new logo links our games — meaningful, powerful stories — with who we are as a company.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_s94ud6Qg\nIn addition to the reworked name and logo, Don't Nod also unveiled a new website sporting the fresh branding. The site has a community-focused theme, and includes a section where players and fans will be able to upload content related to Don't Nod titles — such as artwork, short stories, and poetry, as well as testimonies and memories of their personal experiences with the company's releases. The company also recently won plaudits for introducing \"work-from-home\" options for its workforce, a move that also opened up further opportunities for remote and satellite employees.\n\"I am very proud of the journey that DON’T NOD has been on over the past 14 years, \" said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. \"The company has evolved in many ways with a strong will to lead the way in creating and publishing meaningful entertainment, through original and relatable stories, which empower our talents and players to inspire change, however small.

          "description": "It seems to utilize enemy materials for crafting reagents\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 gem crafting returns, as shown in a new tweet from the game's official Japanese Twitter account.\nEnabled by party member Riku, you'll use items gathered from enemies to create the gems, which can be equipped by characters. Increased attack and recovery power are cited as bonuses so far. For Xenoblade followers, the announcement of a gem system doesn't really come as a shock — unless it's a shock in the sense that you're paralyzed by the fear of having to go through this system again.\nGems (not just in this series, but in general JRPG-dom) are polarizing, to say the least, as some involve a laborious amount of grinding, or some form of randomness. Based on what we've seen so far though this Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gem mechanic seems a lot more straightforward. The example shown in the below tweet showcases players crafting a plus attack power gem, using six different ingredients, as well as a coin currency (that serves as an alternative method of crafting gems).\nIt's unknown where coins are acquired in-game, but it could be a sidequest currency of sorts. The three classic roles (defender [blue]/attacker [red]/healer [green]) also seem present, with a fourth category (denoted by a star and an orange gem color) that is possibly a catch-all. It's out...really soon (like a month and a few weeks!) so we'll know soon enough.\nhttps://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1531170715864510464\nThe post Gem crafting is back in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Blue Blur of the Wild\nToday, Sega and IGN premiered a big look at the gameplay of the next Sonic game, Sonic Frontiers. Across seven minutes it shows plenty of rolling around at the speed of sound, but also some strong influence from other open-world games.\nSonic Frontiers is set to be the next big game for Sonic, and it's tackling the open-world genre. In today's footage, it's easy to see some influence from games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\nAlongside the literal tower that Sonic starts the clip out climbing, there are also big expanses to roam across. Plus, it seems like more than a few environmental puzzles are in store too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxJ5_ovBC_g\nAt one point, Sonic runs circles around some flames to unlock a sort-of radar ping. In another, he's walking across blocks in the correct order to light them up, without overlapping his trail. I think it's fairly safe to say this is drawing on some modern open-world conventions.\nPower up the Sonic Cycle\nOne thing we've yet to see is what's tying all this together. Seeing Sonic run around in an open world is one thing, but I'm curious as to what the goals and structure of the game will be. Previous Sonic games usually fall into level-based formats with objectives and structure, but it seems like Sonic can just roam the open world for collectibles and puzzles in Sonic Frontiers.\nThis Sonic Frontiers gameplay is only a first look, though. There's likely more info to come as IGN has Sonic Frontiers as their First feature for the month of June. Hopefully we get a little more info about what sort of enemies, characters, and goals we're dealing with in the wide-open world of Sonic Frontiers soon.\nSonic Frontiers is aiming to launch this year on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers debuts some open-world gameplay and puzzles appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a no-brainer: I've already downloaded it into my dreams, so I may as well make it official.\nIn reality, this is actually a pair of mods. One of them is a Tifa as Yuna outfit from urbandayz. Another is a Cloud as Tidus costume from Ninjagrime12. With both mods deployed, they work in concert to allow you to live out your FFX fantasy: because of course you know you want to.\nA little housekeeping: so the Cloud as Tidus mod doesn't require much legwork to get going. There's an optional \"Brotherhood over the Buster Sword\" mod that reworks Cloud's weapon into the FFX version from Uploaded by swifferpilled — but you don't need it. On the Tifa side, you will need to consider that you won't be able to see her hands properly as-is. You'll want to apply the \"Tifa Invisible Weapons\" mod from Narknon to smooth things over.\nIf you want, you can use the Amano Barret design to remake the whole crew!

          "description": "Ever ready for the next battle\nBandai Namco's foremost fighting title, Tekken 7, has smashed its way to an amazing nine million sales. The impressive number was revealed by Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada on Twitter this morning — the eve of the fifth anniversary of the face smasher's home release.\nOriginally launching in Japanese arcades way back in 2015, it took two long years for the latest King of Iron Fist Tournament to make its way to PC and console platforms — by which point it had already seen a revamp in the form of 2016's Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. The home port of Tekken 7 was an immediate success when it finally hit the scene on June 2, 2017, and would go on to receive a slew of new characters, stages, modes, and exciting guest stars.\nClearly, Tekken 7 is still pulling in the punters, having sold a further million copies since we last checked in on its sales figures back in November 2021. With a fresh season of fighting game tournaments on the horizon, it looks like Jin Kazama, Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and the rest of the Tekken clan are not ready to bow out just yet. And why not? After all, it's a really rad game, and one of the premier titles in the current fighting game scene. With this milestone, the Tekken franchise has now shifted over 53 million copies since its inception, way back in 1994.\nTekken 7 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Virtua Fighter 5 fans should note that Tekken-themed costume DLC will be dropping in Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown today, June 1.\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1531893312306683905?s=20&t=9zSUhISTU8hycAUZnkCHqw\n \nThe post Tekken 7 smashes mighty nine million sales milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Seeing John Madden's friendly face was actually the reason why I picked up the series in the first place on the SNES, and he's making a comeback for the Madden NFL 23 cover for the first time in a long time.\nFrom 1988 until the year 2000 (when Eddie George kicked off the tradition of players on covers), John Madden himself adorned the cover of the series (from 2000-2005, Madden was present as a little sticker-like logo). After that, the \"Madden curse\" and the hype of who would be the next star athlete to appear was the next big thing, and became a given: until Madden NFL 23.\nThis year, EA is doing something a little differently. This morning, the publisher unveiled the cover (which is \"three unique covers\"), and it's none other than John Madden himself. Artist Chuck Styles, who did the digital art for the Madden NFL 23 cover(s), had the following to say about Madden's legacy: “As someone who grew up loving football, playing in the suburbs of West Philly, it’s a full circle moment to now be able to contribute to the culture of the sport by honoring an icon like John Madden, who has influenced generations of football fans through his passion for football and unmistakable energy, through my art.\"\nEA has also dubbed June 1 \"Madden Day,\" announced remastered audio of Madden for the game, a Madden mode (with two versions of Madden coaching \"All Madden Athletes\" in the 1970s), and have dedicated the EA HQ Redwood football field as \"John Madden Field,\" with Madden family members in attendance. \"More ways EA is honoring John Madden will be announced in the coming weeks.\" It's a 'lotta Madden!\n\nThe post John Madden returns to the cover of Madden NFL 23 for the first time in decades appeared first on Destructoid.",

Join Game Informer as we react live to everything shown during this State of Play presentation live on Twitch!\nWatch on Twitch!\nYour host for today's exciting show is the one and only Alex Stadnik. The big man will kick off the proceedings live starting at 4:45 p.m. CT for a little preshow where he'll give you some predictions and bring the hype. But what can people expect from today's State of Play? According to the official PlayStation Blog, fans can look forward to: \"exciting reveals from our third-party partners, plus a sneak peek at several games in development for PlayStation VR2.\" We know one of those games is Horizon Call of the Mountain, developer Guerrilla Games' and Firesprite's collaboration featuring one of Sony's biggest franchises.\nWe know PSVR2 will be featured, but what else can fans look forward to? With an emphasis on third-party titles, there's been plenty of speculation on whether or not Capcom or Square Enix may make an appearance. The former has plenty for PlayStation fans to be excited about, including Resident Evil Village DLC and the recently announced Street Fighter 6. The latter also has big games coming to the PS5, including Forspoken and Final Fantasy XVI. Will any of the games listed make an appearance? Did I just jinx us, and now we're not getting anything listed in this article? Only time will tell, but that's why you have to tune in later today.\nThank you so much for watching. If you enjoy our watch-along streams, be sure to subscribe to our Twitch pages to get notified the second we go live and to get access to our tremendous exclusive Discord.",

          "description": "No longer shall it be called Dragon Age 4, as developer BioWare has revealed a new name for the upcoming RPG that will henceforth be known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.\nA blog post announcing the title also goes into one possible meaning behind it. It's of course a reference to Solas, AKA The Dread Wolf, who happens to share a moniker with the game, although with a slight difference in spelling. Once an ally to players, this Solas is being set up as the big bad in Dreadwolf. The post describes him as maybe being \"an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people…or a savior who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world. His motives are inscrutable and his methods sometimes questionable, earning him a reputation as something of a trickster deity—a player of dark and dangerous games.\"\nDragon Age: Dreadwolf and Solas' machinations won't see the light of day this year, according to the post, at least not in any playable form. However, there will be more information coming about the game before the year is over. Outside of that tease for upcoming details, there isn't much more to learn about the next chapter in the Dragon Age saga in the immediate future. So until then, enjoy knowing the official title and the logo above, which the studio does leave open for more meaning than just a reference to Solas.",

Starting tomorrow, a new patch will be applied to the fighting game that will add balance changes to the roster, but more importantly, also add new mechanics to the game.\nPatch 2.80 for Granblue Fantasy Versus is ushering in three new mechanics that will undoubtedly change the game in massive ways. First is Rush, a tactical move that dashes the character forward to quickly close the distance on the opponent and strike when they least expect it. Similarly, Backshift is a dash backward that allows for a quick escape from pressure or a dodge to use in dicey situations, like back-dashing on wakeup to foil the opposition's advanc…",

          "description": "Variety reported last year that a Twisted Metal series was on the way from the writers of Deadpool, and then we later learned the show will debut on Peacock. \nAnthony Mackie, perhaps best known as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (although he does have a new role in it now), was cast as the series’ star last September and now we know who will be playing the most iconic character from the Twisted Metal franchise, Sweet Tooth. It will be none other than Will Arnett, the voice of Batman in The Lego Batman Movie and the titular character in Bojack Horseman. \nThis news comes by way of Variety, which reports that Arnett will “voice” Sweet Tooth, which kind of makes it sound like Sweet Tooth will either be a CGI character or the person acting as Sweet Tooth won’t be voicing him. Or, of course, perhaps Arnett will play Sweet Tooth on set, too, while also voicing him in post-production, given the whole head-on-fire part of the character. Variety reports that the show’s Sweet Tooth is “described as a hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning,” and a “lover of chaos.”\n“[This] majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses ‘Lost Vegas’ as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck,” Variety writes.\nThe publication reports that Arnett was long-rumored for this role in addition to working as an executive producer for the show. Arnett joins Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn 99), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (the Scream franchise) in this series. \n[Source: Variety]\nAre you excited about this Twisted Metal series?

          "description": "Yesterday, Sega debuted roughly 30 seconds of Sonic Frontiers open-world gameplay and today, you can now watch more than seven minutes of gameplay, courtesy of IGN. It’s basically an extended look at what was showcased yesterday and it looks great. \nRight off the bat, it’s beautiful – looking more realistic than any Sonic game before, too – and it’s clear that speed is the name of the game because there’s virtually nothing in the way of stopping the Blue Blur. It’s cliche to say, but it looks like if you see something in the distance, there’s a way for you to speed all the way over there, be it by rail, ramp, on ground, or something else. Take a look for yourself below:\n\n\nAs you can see, running isn’t all that’s in this extended gameplay look. There are plenty of Sonic staples, like on-ground boosts, bumpers, and more. Plus, there are towers that act as platforming challenges, tasking you with reaching the top. Elsewhere, there are simple puzzles to solve that involve stepping on lit switches as well as a speed wheel (think: hamster wheel, or hedgehog wheel, I suppose) that seems to do something to the surrounding area. Maybe it defogs a map, or unlocks new areas to explore. Only time will tell for now. \nUnfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer. While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted yesterday. \nWhat do you think of this gameplay?

If you plan on playing the first-ever, built-from-the-ground-up-for-mobile Diablo game on a phone, then head to your app store to see if it’s available.\nWhile waiting for it to download, check out our latest gameplay from it below:\n\n\n“As we prepare to launch Diablo Immortal on June 2 at 10 a.m. PDT for iOS, Android, and PC in Open Beta, some players will see Immortal propagate on the Apple App Store and Google Play beginning the morning of June 1 PDT,” a blog post reads. “This is in part due to the nature of how mobile games rollout to ensure a smooth full launch for the mobile version of Immortal. To confirm when Immortal will be fully launched for your region on all platforms, please reference the below time map.” \nThe blog post mentions that the game won’t launch in some Asia Pacific regions, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, until June 22. It will launch that same day in Vietnam but only on PC in Open Beta. According to Blizzard, these regions will receive dedicated game servers to bring players better connectivity and ping. \nFor more information about this rollout, including a look at Blizzard’s current roadmap for Diablo Immortal, head to this “Roadmap To Hell.” After that, read Game Informer’s review in progress of Diablo Immortal, and then check out this Diablo Immortal segment of New Gameplay Today to look at how it runs on both mobile devices and PC. \nAre you excited to jump into Diablo Immortal?

On that day, you'll be able to choose between the three starters: Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly. They will likely be given to you by the new professors (yes, plural) of Generation 9: Professor Sada if you're playing Scarlet (left) and Professor Turo if you're playing Violet (right).\nYou can check them out in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nShortly after their introduction, the trailer reveals that four-player co-op will be in Scarlet and Violet, a first for the Pokémon series. It won't be limited to just online battles like in previous games, though – it seems we'll be able to explore the region with other players. Throughout the trailer, we get glimpses at returning favorites and new Pokémon, such as Pawmi, Lechonk (great name), and Smoliv.\nPlus, we see what appears to be some very Pokémon Legends: Arceus-style sleuthing and monster catching too. \nThe trailer concludes with the reveal of this generation's two primary legendaries: Karaidon, the red dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art of Scarlet, and Maraidon, the purple dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art for Violet. Both appear to live off the coast of this region, high atop some cliffs in the ocean. \n\nFor more about Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, watch the original reveal trailer, which includes a nice look at this gen's starters, and then check out our living list of every Pokémon in these games confirmed so far.

Before this update, you simply could not – the console would let you know an achievement was secret, but you’d have to search online elsewhere to determine its objective. Starting this month, you can choose to reveal secret achievements, according to a new Xbox Wire blog post, as reported by IGN. \n“If you don’t mind spoilers or want a hint on any of the achievements in the games you’re playing, it’s easy to find the secret achievement details on your Xbox,” the blog post reads. “From within a game, open the guide and go to Game Activity > Achievements. When you see a secret achievement, you can now reveal details like the title, achievement description, and Gamerscore. And after you peek, you can go back and hide it or continue to display the details. \n“You can reveal secret achievements anywhere you like to play and track your achievements from Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, the Xbox app for Android and iOS, the Xbox app for Windows PC, and Game Bar on your PC.” \nHere’s a look at how it works: \nWhile waiting for this update to download, read about how Xbox and Bethesda are hosting a games showcase next week, and then check out Game Informer’s in-house predictions for that showcase after that. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about this update?

It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. \nThis new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon. \nWhat do you think of this gameplay teaser?

Developer Stunlock Studios revealed that the game has pushed past 1.5 million copies sold in only two weeks.\nStunlock doesn’t provide an exact sales number, but 1.5 million+ is a remarkable feat for a game technically in its infancy. V Rising has been popular on Twitch and has garnered strong reviews thus far. The game puts you in the undead boots of a newly awakened vampire who must build their empire. Similar to games like Valheim, players explore an open world in search of resources (either from nature itself or by pillaging villages) to construct a castle and become the second coming of Dracula. Combat pushes you to use your supernatural abilities to take down a host of otherworldly creatures, and you can tackle the game alongside friends in co-op. You can also attack other players’ castles in PvP. \n\n\nAs an Early Access title, V Rising will continue to receive updates and improvements over the next several months.

As for price, each will be available for $7.99 and both games will come with their previously released DLC, which incudes Ida’s Dream and Forgotten Shores for Monument Valley and The Lost Forest for Monument Valley II. \nWhile waiting for July 12, read Game Informer’s Monument Valley review and then read Game Informer’s Monument Valley II review. \nAre you excited to play these games on PC?

However, a lesser-known series that's produced some under-the-radar experiences is returning. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered is launching on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and iOS and Android devices this winter. \nThe instruments change, but 30 years later the melody remains the same.\npic.twitter.com/Y6D48xDK9O\nMay 31, 2022\nMinstrel Song dropped exclusively on PlayStation 2 in 2005. The updated visuals (changed from bit art to 3D) don't do much to improve the very bizarre character designs, but fans of the series that never got to play it more than a decade ago will finally get to test their skills with the game's combat and class systems. \nMinstrel Song itself is a remake of the original Romancing SaGa game released on the Super Famicom in 1992. The narrative follows eight adventurers as they try to stop the resurgence of an ancient deity of darkness. \nThe Game Informer archives reveal that Joe Juba gave Romancing SaGa a 5 out of 10 and said that the game vied for the worst RPG of the year. Hopefully, the remaster gives it a second lease on life. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered drops on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and mobile devices later this year.",

That’s because in the canonized novel Star Wars: Brotherhood, which is about the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a reference to Blitzball being played in a local lake is made. How do we know it’s the Blitzball from Final Fantasy X? Well, the author of Brotherhood, Mike Chen, is the person who revealed this fun detail, as reported by GamesRadar. \n#6: There's a reference to a sport called Blitzball played in a local lake. Blitzball is basically underwater hockey played as a minigame in Final Fantasy X. As a former NHL writer, I freaking loved Blitzball and spent hours winning leagues. pic.twitter.com/uad4uIMcrA\nMay 17, 2022\nAs you can see, it seems Chen was a big enough fan of the sport that he included a reference to it in his canon Star Wars novel. Does someone have a lightsaber that looks like Caladbolg, though? \nIf you’re interested in other Brotherhood easter eggs such as this, Chen has an entire thread dedicated to them on Twitter. \nFor more about Star Wars, watch the new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and then watch this new Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 2 trailer.

As for why, the famed director cites Radahn’s alluring design as a character in The Lands Between as well as the festival surrounding him. \n\n\n“It’s tough to decide, but I’d have to say Radahn,” Miyazaki said. “As an individual character, he’s really alluring, and I really like the Radahn Festival situation. There’s a literal sense of festivity and exuberance, but also a unique tinge of sadness and loneliness.” \nHe said when he first brought up the idea of Radahn and his festival, “no one on the team took it seriously,” which is extra funny considering this boss is Miyazaki’s favorite. He added that his next favorite bosses after Radahn are Godrick, the Grafted and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. He also said one of his favorite designs out of anything in the game is the 12-fingered Caria Manor hand spiders, because of course (they still give me the heebie-jeebies). \n“Spider Hand is one of my favorite designs,” Miyazaki said in the Xbox Wire Japan post. “It’s something you don’t want to even look at because it’s so horrible. I wonder if the way to overcome your issue is to face it head on and beat it.” \n\n\nI was more of a “oohp, there’s one of those hand spider things so I’m going to turn around now” kind of player. \nFor more, read about this Elden Ring mod that lets you party up with NPCs and bosses like Malenia and then check out Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10.

          "description": "Video Gameography is on hiatus this week, but in the interim, we'd like to announce the next season officially. \nSeason six of Video Gameography will chronicle one of the most stylish franchises around: Devil May Cry. Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or \"Stylish Action\"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory's reboot. Dante, black-haired Dante, Virgil, Sparda, Trish, Nero, Lady, V; all of your favorite characters are going to be there! Here's the complete list of games we'll be talking about in the coming weeks:\nDevil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 2\nDevil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening\nDevil May Cry 4\nDmC: Devil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 5\nVideo Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. \nLast season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry. \nListen and subscribe to Video Gameography on your favorite podcast service. If you enjoy the show, don't forget to give us a five-star review, and make sure to let us know what you enjoy about it.

This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.\nThe Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.\nWe recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying \"Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables.\"",

He starred in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order alongside Cal Kestis, will be in the just-announced sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and may have even been in an episode of The Book of Boba Fett. This adorable droid is now getting the brick treatment with a Lego set launching this August.\nLego announced this BD-1 set at Star Wars Celebration and showed off what it can do. The set consists of 1,062 pieces and is a part of Lego's recent droid line, which consists of R2-D2, D-O, and a Probe Droid. BD-1's legs move, his head tilts, and you can open a tray that holds healing cannisters. Lego also included a display plaque that comes with a BD-1 minifigure. Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99. You can see it in all of its glory in the images below:\nLego also gave us our first look at a forthcoming set based on Andor, a new Disney Plus series slated to release later this year. This set comes with minifigures of Cassian Andor, Luthen Rael, and inspector Syril Karn. The Mobile Tac-Pod is piloted by Karn.",

In the 1988 comic story The Killing Joke, Barbara is famously shot through the spine by the Joker, paralyzing and confining her to a wheelchair for many years in which she lent tech and information support to Batman as Oracle.

The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.\nThese announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.\nThe trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.\nHasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.\nHasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.\nHasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.",

EA and Respawn Entertainment have officially revealed the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order. This new title will continue the story of force-wielder Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nA brief teaser trailer was shown with the unveiling, which you can watch above. In it, the odds seem stacked against Cal and what may or may not remain of his crew from Fallen Order. Of the known characters, only Kestis and his trusty droid BD-1 make an appearance in the footage, though their cohort Greez's ship, the Stinger Mantis, is seen from the cockpit, empty and in a bad way in a desert.

          "description": "Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. \nYesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: \nTF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.\nMay 26, 2022\nValve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.",

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
