The hedgehog's latest 3D adventure launched earlier this week and Sonic fans have been able to spend a good chunk of time with the game. Reviews for the game across all platforms really run the gamut, with some critics hailing it as a stirring success and the beginning of a new era for 3D Sonic games, while others have found its open world and overall approach to be ambitious but aimless — and all opinions in between.\nOur review went live earlier, and as you can see, we tend to fall on the latter end of the spectrum.

Yep, we were a little confused at first too. Has Mario seen all the outpouring of Bowser love following the movie trailer and is now determined to flip-off anyone in his path? Nope. That's not Mario, and that's not @NintendoAmerica.\nParody accounts have been a part of Twitter since the site's conception, but all of a sudden the discourse surrounding them has reached a whole new height thanks to the new 'Twitter Blue' policy and the chance to buy 'verification' status with the renowned blue tick next to your name. Of course, the parody accounts did exactly what they were always going to do and took this opportunity to post some very much off-brand content (who could have seen that coming??).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Blue sky blues.\nSonic Frontiers had a bit of a wild ride ahead of its release. Since the initial announcement and subsequent trailer reveals, public opinion of the blue blur’s latest outing has been all over the place, going from lingering dread to a more optimistic “hey, maybe this will actually be okay, after all”. Well, after sinking over 20 hours into Sonic Frontiers on Switch and exploring everything the game has to offer, we have just two words that can adequately describe our feelings for this game: oh dear.\nThe game starts off with a brief introduction to our heroes Sonic, Tails, and Amy (don't worry, Knuckles shows up too). After some digital hocus pocus, Sonic mysteriously winds up in one of the game’s ‘Cyberspace’ levels which, surprise surprise, is based on Green Hill Zone. This linear stage acts as a tutorial for Sonic’s basic moveset, but you’ll be able to revisit it later on to complete the optional objectives and gain extra items, if you wish. After you’re done, you’re dropped into the first of five “open-zone” locations: Kronos Island. It turns out that Sonic’s friends are missing and it’s up to you to find and rescue them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Still no word on GBA games coming to Switch.\nBackwards compatibility is rapidly becoming easier for Nintendo than ever before. At least, that's what Shingeru Miyamoto implied at a recent Q&A following the company's latest financial report. And while the Switch continues to build up a growing library of NES, SNES and N64 titles (if you have the NSO Expansion pass, that is) Miyamoto wants to ensure that the company remains focused on the future, despite this ease.\nReading through any Reddit forum or the comments section of an NSO announcement, it would be easy to assume that if Nintendo was to just drop a Game Boy and GBA library on the Switch then all would be well in the world. Miyamoto addressed the simplicity of this in the Q&A (as translated for VGC by @Sephazon), speaking of how difficult Nintendo's Virtual Console was in the past, before stating that all of this has changed:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's even less frequent that we get to travel to a game studio to do them.

We couldn't pass up the opportunity to bag a world-exclusive chat with Lukas and Annie, the two developers of this charming tidying-up puzzle game, and we're glad we did, because we think the game is exactly what many of us need right now: Something quiet, contemplative, and a little bit magical.

But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world.

          "description": "Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). \nMostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me. \nRead more",

I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.\nSo, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.\nRead more",

It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. \nAt the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.\nRead more",

So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time.

These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.\nThey’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware. \nRead more",

          "description": "Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that's always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.\nBut Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.\nRead more",

It seems as if this November update is going to make due on a lot of prior delays.\nHere are the main sticking points of the Halo Infinite 2022 November Patch:\nNetwork campaign co-op (four player co-op in the campaign)\nCampaign mission replay (this seems like a launch type feature, but it's here now)\nMore campaign achievements (420 additional Gamerscore)\nForge mode (in beta form)\nSeason pass progression updates (more of a focus on match XP)\nA 30-tier winter battle pass is live\nStudio 343 explains that you can play the \"entire Halo Infinite campaign together\" with up to four players in total, so it doesn't seem like a half-measure. As for the Forge, 343 stresses that it's in beta form: \"Halo Infinite Forge mode is currently in a beta state, meaning that additional improvements are planned. The Forge Beta will support canvas maps and not developer-made maps (such as Live Fire, Recharge, Fragmentation, etc.). Support for developer-made maps will be implemented in a future update.\"\nWeirdly, 343 still hasn't figured out battle pass progression yet, and will be implementing a \"match XP beta\" (what?) on top of the challenge system.\nHere's a brief look at the changes to Halo Infinite's XP progression system:\nArena Match Complete: 150 XP\nBig Team Battle (BTB) Match Complete: 250 XP\nFeatured Match Complete: 200 XP\nWinning Team: 50 XP\nMatch MVP: 50 XP\nTop 50% of Team: 50 XP\nFree-For-All placement\n\n1st: 150 XP\n2nd: 100 XP\n3rd: 50 XP\n4th: 50 XP\n5th: 50 XP\nIf you can believe it, progression systems in live service games that have been in operation for nearly a year need betas.\nThe post Massive Halo Infinite update adds more achievements and much-delayed modes appeared first on Destructoid.",

Basically, most versions have welcomed the packed 1.5 update a while back: except mobile. But that's still set to change by the end of the year.\nHere's the full picture from developer Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone, recently shared on Twitter:\n\"Hey everyone, happy 'ween (spirit's eve). I know I haven't been too active lately, but don't worry, I'm still here. And mobile 1.5 update is still on track for what I said last: 'Before the end of the year.' Thank you\"\n\n\"What they said last\" was roughly three months ago: but in this era of constant delays and production issues, it's great to have a more up-to-date window. When asked about progress on Haunted Chocolatier by a fan, Barone reminded folks that they were working on it (citing \"yeah a little\" when quizzed on whether or not they've been working on spooky in-game ghosts), so there's a lot to be done and micro-manage.\nBarone has thankfully fostered a healthy environment of patience, as Stardew Valley fans trust in the process, and recognize Barone's limitations as a mostly solo developer.

And with relative ease.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr_OEM8zP0k\nSet in the town of Shiokawa, Japan, World of Horror follows a young investigator as they follow a series of obscure and bizarre clues, ultimately uncovering evidence of a coming apocalypse, heralded by a platoon of grotesque creatures. The player engages in turn-based combat with these monstrosities in their efforts to seek out the truth about armageddon and, hopefully, discover a way to prevent it.\nWorld of Horror launches summer 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

Teams will be given free rein to complete a series of core missions, accept side objectives, and battle it out with other operators and A.I. bots. From this early description, it almost sounds like DMZ is an amalgamation of previous Call of Duty multiplayer experiences, such as Fireteam and Zombies... Except without the zombies.\n\nThe brief blurb also seems to confirm the CoD community's suspicions that DMZ is to be Call of Duty's take on Battlestate Games' own long-running shooter Escape From Tarkov. Launched in open beta way back in 2017, Escape From Tarkov is another open-world military shooter that tasks squads of players with gathering intel, completing missions, and exfiltrating from the battlezone, all while engaging in bullet-pumping firefights with bots and other players.\nDMZ will launch as part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2/Warzone 2.0's Season One content, which will include new Warzone map Al Mazrah — complete with revamped Gulag mode — as well as a fistful of new operators, weapons, vehicles, and modes, all of which will roll out over the coming weeks.

At this point the budgets are fairly insane, and there's only so many hours of the day to work on AAA games. One of the leads of the series agrees, which gives us a clear idea of where God of War might go after Ragnarok.\nWhen interviewed by Kaptain Kuba on YouTube, God of War boss Cory Barlog explained why he thought it would be best for the Norse arc to end in two games:\n\"The most important reason is: the first game took five years. The second game, I don't know how long it's going to take, close to a similar time. If you think wow a third one, that's a span of close to 15 years of a single story. I feel like that's just too stretched out. We're asking too much to say the actual completion, of the story, it takes too long. Given where Eric [Williams] was at, I thought we can actually do this in the second story. The core of the story's engine is really the relationship between [Atreus and Kratos] and the complexity radiates out like ripples in a pond. We could make it an ocean and have those ripples go thousands of miles...but is that beneficial?\"\n\nWithout giving away too much, suffice to say that Atreus and Kratos' journey could go on after Ragnarok; and given the massive critical and commercial success of the game already, it's probably a sure thing. Will the core team want to devote their lives to another five year journey, is the real question.\nMaybe we'll get another mythological road trip through another civilization and set of Gods, or perhaps Atreus himself will be the focal point this time around: with the same actor, naturally aged up.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok leaves the door open for more appeared first on Destructoid.",

There are also specific stability fixes for both PS4 and PS5. You can check out the huge list of fixes via the official patch notes, though be warned that SSM suggests that the tweaks feature minor spoilers pertaining to abilities, creatures, and questlines. The update should download as soon as you install the game.\nGod of War Ragnarok is the follow-up to the stellar 2018 release, God of War. The new title follows the continued adventures of an aging Kratos and his brave but somewhat inexperienced son, Atreus, as they face the coming of Ragnarok — the fabled event said to bring death and destruction to a number of gods and figures of power, while bringing chaos to the world and its climate. Quite what role our heroes will play in this event, and how it ties into the lives of their allies and enemies...

Now I'm waiting for basically anything else. A PC port would do.\nSadly there is no confirmation at all right now that Ghost of Tsushima is even getting a PC port, but we can look at some trends and surmise that it's likely going to happen. It was also part of that partially correct, partially incorrect Nvidia PC leak from 2021.\nHere are the games Sony currently has on PC/Steam:\nGod of War (2018)\nSpider-Man Remastered\nSpider-Man: Miles Morales (out on November 18)\nUncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy)\nSackboy: A Big Adventure\nNote that the earliest game is God of War, and it was released in January of this year. Yep, all of the above list launched in 2022. Sony is clearly serious about porting their biggest games to PC, and if Sackboy can make the cut, a lot of other titles could too.\nBut Ghost of Tsushima, like many other open world games, would be incredible to mess around with on PC. I mean, just imagine the mods! And the graphical options! While it hasn't happened yet, I'm hoping we get some form of announcement in early 2023, perhaps via a State of Play.

Among these legends of Norse mythology, Kratos and Atreus will encounter the somber Tyr, whose limp frame and addled mind belie his ultimate identity: That of the son of Odin and the defiant Aesirian God of War.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E\nTyr's mythology is somewhat muddled across various localizations, but he is generally depicted as one of the sons of Odin and the half-brother to Thor, Heimdall, Baldur, and Skjöld. A variant of Mars, Tyr takes up the role of God of War for Aesir, (as opposed to Kratos' Grecian heritage), and is usually depicted as missing a hand — torn off during the binding of the wolf-god Fenrir. While Tyr does not play as large a role in mythology as his siblings, he is nevertheless associated with themes of bravery, victory, and glory.\nTyr's appearance in God of War Ragnarok, much like his mythological origins, starts a little inauspiciously. Found imprisoned in the dwarven caves of Svartfalfheim — his mind almost entirely lost to fear and paranoia. A shadow of the glorious God of War foretold by fate. As to whether Tyr's senses can be restored, and what role he will play in Kratos and Atreus' journey toward the impending apocalypse, players will simply have to delve into the adventure for themselves.\nGod of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.\nThe post Hand of God: Who is Týr in God of War Ragnarok? appeared first on Destructoid.",

One such look was at amiibo, which have slowed down considerably since their 2014 debut: but still persist nonetheless.\nHere's what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about amiibo:\n\"Next, I would like to discuss amiibo, which we launched in 2014. Tapping an amiibo to an NFC touchpoint on hardware can have all kinds of fun results in compatible games, such as the in-game appearance of the amiibo character or special items. We continue to release new amiibo products each year, and cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units.\"\n\nMost of it is a boiler plate statement to keep investors interested in the idea of amiibo, but reading between the lines, Nintendo has no real reason to give up on the initiative yet. They're seemingly still selling, and the statement hints considerably at keeping the amiibo side of the business alive; at least in the short term.\nIf you're curious about what the future holds for amiibo: as always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. In the short term, the Splatoon 3 amiibo are just around the corner, and are scheduled to arrive on November 11.\nThe post Despite slowed amiibo releases, Nintendo has shipped over 77 million of them appeared first on Destructoid.",

All you need to do is scrape a few reagents off the rock in the quest area, then go down into the depths with Brok, and you'll get the spear.\nUsing the Draupnir Spear\nTo select the Draupnir Spear, you'll press down on the d-pad. Think of it like a \"neutral\" type weapon that doesn't utilize the fire of the blades or the ice of the axe. In other words, it's generally great for every situation, unless you need to whittle down a shield off an enemy (which you'll do with the opposite type of element). One of the best ways to wield the spear is to toss an infinite amount of projectiles (hold L2) at enemies: which is also the solution to a lot of in-game puzzles.\nAlso, keep in mind that all three weapons do not share cooldowns for light and heavy abilities. Make it a priority to swap between each weapon and constantly unleash your cooldowns. It's going to be hard to get the Draupnir Spear in that rotation having worked with the other two for so long, but just get in the habit of using the spear, and you'll remember when it counts.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok: How to unlock & get the Draupnir Spear appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll come across specific locations where you can initiate a minigame, hosted by Big the Cat. It'll be denoted by a fish icon on the map.\nOnce you're in, Big will actually g…",

          "description": "We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.\nIt's impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.\nFirst, we had to reserve a time to enter that particular…",

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how the refund process works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",

We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.\nIn August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise's return through NFL Blitz Le…",

The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat.

You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B.

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. \nAtomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart.

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series?

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.",

The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.\nSpry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development.

That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them.

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",
