When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one.

Expect cooperative multiplayer, solo play, base management, and a trailer which doesn't show much of anything.\nRead more",

He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. \"I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,\" he tells me.\nThe pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, \"we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,\" he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had \"a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks\" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but \"Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,\" says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, \"you can kind of see how that went from A to B\".\nRead more",

Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the \"you're about to be unemployed\" language right there.

Of course, there's little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.\nHaving said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, \"something very fast\". Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.\nRead more",

I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).\nCrucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.\nRead more",

Such a weak title deserves a much worse game, but this captures the feeling of its late 90s FPS influences as they actually were, and ends up just familiar enough to work, and just original enough to refresh the formula. At times, it's a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I'm impressed with the balancing act it's struck.\nRead more",

I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.\nI'm worried about Dragon Age. I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking. What I'd like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon's (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.\nRead more",

This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”\nSunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”\nRead more",

I'm delighted by its deserved success, with the makers boasting that it sold enough to become profitable within one hour then sold 250,000 copies in 72 hours. In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it's so damn successful is because they've barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it's free to do its own thing outside genre conventions. What's interesting to me in this is how Balatro has built on a game which did influence it, the slot machine-building game Luck Be A Landlord.\nRead more",

Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you'll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur's Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It's a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively \"provincialises\" the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Or until you hold down the power button.\nThis crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re \"not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch,\" after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.\nRead more",

I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble's Age Of Mythology.\nI'm not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn't even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn't bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren't for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night.

          "description": "Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.\nIt's also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you're off the clock, it's time to pick up the game's wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.\nRead more",

It's the debut game from a team of indie devs that include Braid artist David Hellman, Carto writer Nick Suttner and Ethereal designer Nicolás Recabarren, and they've also partnered with composer Tomás Batista, who did the music for both Ethereal and Martian colony builder Per Aspera. It's a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it's Arranger's world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that's really piqued my curiosity.

In addition to a stylish new hoverboard to get around, Guardian Games participants can try their luck at new challenges and rake in some unique rewards.\n\n\nThe Guardian Games is a yearly event in Destiny 2 framed as a friendly competition between the three playable classes. It's the one time of year when players are encouraged to compete against each other to help their favored class reign supreme. While that's still largely the case, a few alterations have been made to spice up 2024's Games.\n\n\nA full breakdown of the 2024 Guardi…",

          "description": "A new Terminator game has been in development for some time, and you'll be able to play it later this year. Well, in Early Access at least, as Terminator: Survivor will be hitting Steam on October 24. Check out the \"Aftermath\" trailer below.\n\n\nIf you haven't heard of this – and I must admit I was a bit ignorant of it – Survivors is an open-world game that's set after Judgment Day in James Cameron's sci-fi universe. \n\n\n\n\nThe above trailer doesn't give a huge amount away. We see two scavengers, nervously seeking out supplies. With the world in such turmoil, the threat of a Terminator is ever-present. We then get to see the reflection of one of the skeletal robots as it scans the two fuel-seeking humans.\n\n\n100% rustproof\n\n\nTerminator: Survivors is being developed by Nacon, and is pretty hot off the heels of the publisher's previous game based on a popular sci-fi franchise: RoboCop: Rogue City. Much like the latter, Rogue City offers a new lease on life for the iconic film series.\n\n\nWhether Survivors will be as well received remains to be seen at this stage. An open-world game where you're fighting and surviving against killer robots? Sign me the heck up.\n\n\nNacon describes the upcoming game – which is also getting a release on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 – thus:\n\n\n\nIt’s been four years since the day humanity nearly perished. The truth of the event is still muddied in half-truths as you emerge from a shelter to attempt [to] reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating you and the last vestiges of mankind. You are tasked with scouring the surrounding land for materials, information, other survivors and key resources in order to establish a base of operations for your fledgling group.\n\n\n\n\nFun!\n\nThe post Open world Terminator game, Terminator: Survivors, comes to Early Access this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The remaster of the original three Tomb Raider games was released not that long ago. For PC users, there was a choice between purchasing it on Steam or Epic Games Store. However, there seemed to be some notable differences between the two versions, which the developer has now acknowledged.\n\n\nAccording to a post from The Gamer a couple of days ago, fans began to notice that Tomb Raider I-III Remastered was different on EGS than on Steam. For starters, the Epic Games version had different skyboxes in places like the Colosseum, and the Greece levels had \"new light holes.\"\n\n\n\n\nSince then, a post on the Steam page has noted that EGS had a build of the remaster that had \"incomplete assets,\" and the download contained \"some work-in-progress materials\" that weren't meant for public consumption.\n\n\nUpdate also imminent\n\n\nAspyr has now fixed the problem, uploading the correct version to Epic. However, some – such as a reporter from Eurogamer and the aforementioned The Gamer article – have noted this incomplete build had better-looking assets than the Steam version. This could suggest that the two downloads are not evenly matched, for whatever reason.\n\n\nThat aside, Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is also getting its first update soon. In the same Steam post, the developer thanked fans for their \"continued support, shares, and feedback\" on the games, with an update said to be in the works.\n\n\nWe don't exactly know what's coming, but the studio says it anticipates sending this update out \"in the next few weeks.\"\n\nThe post The Epic Games version of Tomb Raider I-III Remastered was wildly an ‘incomplete’ build appeared first on Destructoid.",

I can say with certainty that I wasn’t expecting to see a stampede of Chocobos on my screen today, though.\n\n\nBut that’s what happens if you do a search for “Chocobo” or “Final Fantasy”, in celebration of the release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Along with the adorable retro Chocobos, you’ll also see a few Cloud Strifes, complete with Buster Sword aplenty and some (slightly disorienting) shaking visuals for the links underneath.\n\n\nWith the excitement surrounding the long awaited release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it makes sense that Google would add this feature as they’ve done for popular titles in the past, such as the Last of Us mushroom easter egg.\n\n\nHow to get a Chocobo stampede on Google\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIt’s super simple to see this easter egg for yourself. All you need to do is head to Google and search “Chocobo” or “Final Fantasy”. All of the usual results will appear, but there will be a small yellow button in the middle of your browser window, toward the bottom, complete with a Chocobo silhouette. \n\n\nClicking on this button once will result in one or two Chocobos and the accompanying shakes of the search results beneath, but the fun really starts when you repeatedly spam click. Doing so will result in a stampede of multicolored Chocobos, as well as Cloud making an appearance. \n\n\nBe careful though, maybe it’s just me being a little too over eager, but pressing the button too much may result in slowing your browser down to a standstill, at least for a little while. \n\n\nStill, it’s fun.

The Closed Beta will run from April 15 through April 21, with sign-ups open now through April 5.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers can embark on a Viking expedition solo or with up to three friends as they work together to build a Viking empire. Collecting resources, building a thriving settlement, and summoning intelligent NPC villages are some of the tasks required to do so. Players will also need to automate, manage, and defend their tribe especially to survive the bitter cold winter.\n\n\n\n\"ASKA stands as a testament to what a dream-team of just 10 people can achieve over the course of 4 years: an ambitious co-op survival tribe builder where you're never alone, where you work alongside lively AI villagers that are almost indistinguishable from players, all woven into a deep city builder-like economy system. We’re entering the final phase of our beta testing period and we can't wait to give players the power to build their very own truly functional Viking village, who knows what they'll build.\"\n- Cristian Diaconescu, Creative Director at Sand Sailor Studio\n\n\n\nWe've seen quite a few survival builders released recently. But honestly, all you had to say was Viking and I'm in. Based on the trailer it looks like you can get pretty creative with actually building out your settlement. And hopefully, they mean it when they say intelligent NPC villagers. I've seen several games in the genre recently add NPCs to help players with tasks like gathering, building, and even fighting. But none of them have quite gotten it right.\n\n\nThose interested in participating in the Closed Beta that runs from April 15 through April 21 can ASKA Discord server before April 5.\n\nThe post Viking survival builder ASKA getting a closed beta in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "February 29 is a rare day, a perfect date to celebrate with a session of the Final Fantasy-themed musical game Theatrhythm Final Bar Line. However, I've got sad news for anyone attempting to celebrate today with a little Theathrythm as the rhythm game just won't load on this day, specifically. \n\n\nThe situation is a bummer, yes, but worry not as a solution already exists, and the cause for the whole thing is rather hilarious.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like what's preventing players from joining the servers is that we're currently existing in the most cursed day of a glitched period in time, the one our calendar lords call \"leap year\". Look, I admit that don't know the complex math behind this cosmic event, but I believe Destructoid's own Zoey Handley perfectly described it as \"a little Y2K that comes 'round every four years\".\n\n\nThis Y2K ordeal becomes twice as hilarious once you remember that Theatrhythm is a mostly offline game. It doesn't need the Internet, hell, it doesn't even need to know what time it is. In fact, the good people at Vooks report having tried it on their consoles, and the fix they found was to just change the console's date to any other date of the year. Thank you, Mr Kojima, you've taught us well.\n\n\nHere's hoping Square Enix solves this problem soon, or the Theatrhythm fans who are too wise to mess with the authorities of time will have to abruptly find new plans for February 29, 2028.\n\n\nThis is such an interesting failure — or maybe, just maybe, Square Enix is bottlenecking Theatrhythm on purpose to prevent it from completely overshadowing the release of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the real competition here all along. There's just no way of knowing.\n\n\nTheatrhythm Final Bar Line is usually available on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, just not today. \n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Rebirth comes out today on the PlayStation 5 and will likely stay available until the great global collapse.\n\nThe post Theatrhythm Final Bar Line won’t load today for hilarious reasons appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hot skippidy Nimbus, it's actually happening. Destiny 2 is getting hoverboards. Announced in one of Bungie's This Week in Destiny communications, and alongside a snazzy-looking trailer, the new vehicle type will be a part of 2024's Guardian Games event.\n\n\nPlayers have asked for hoverboards in Destiny 2 for years, often citing desires to see changes or improvements to the long-standing Sparrows. Naturally, when Nimbus and Rohan showed up on their pseudo-hoverboards in Lightfall, players only wanted them more. \n\n\nNow, Guardians will finally be able to see their dreams come true and give grinding in Destiny a whole new meaning.\n\n\n\n\nBungie is officially calling the hoverboard the 'Skimmer.' And the TWID notes that they'll function a lot like Sparrows, albeit with a couple of notable differences. Namely, Skimmers can grind rails in the environment and look to sport some stylish new trick animations.\n\n\nThe Skimmer coming to the Guardian Games is Allstar Vector, a flat, vaguely spork-shaped silver board adorned with event decals. Everyone can use the Skimmer throughout the free three-week event, and it's possible to earn it for good via Guardian Games' Drop In quest. \n\n\nIn addition to Allstar Vector, Bungie noted that another Skimmer would also be available through the Eververse Store. While the details weren't fully shared, the TWID hinted that it's inspired by a \"beloved\" Destiny weapon. Here's hoping Guardians will soon find themselves hovering around on the old G-horn.\n\n\nDestiny 2's 2024 Guardian Games, and the chance to grab the game's first hoverboard, start on March 5.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 adds a hoverboard for 2024’s Guardian Games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gearbox Entertainment was one of the companies Embracer purchased during its massive buying spree that was followed by widespread layoffs and studio closures. As reported by Kotaku, the Borderlands maker is poised to be sold out, and more information will be shared next month. \n\n\nEmbracer had purchased Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. However, after purchasing studios from around the world, the Swedish company released an open letter explaining that it is aiming to become a “heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business,\" and this will require “closing or divestments of some studios and the termination or pausing of some ongoing game development projects.”\n\n\nThis news doesn't come out of the blue, as in 2023, a report from Reuters previously stated that Gearbox is workin…",

          "description": "On the company’s website, Toys for Bob, the developer behind Skylanders and Crash Bandicoot 4, has announced that it's diverging from Activision Blizzard to become independent.\n\n\nThe post doesn’t really give much more in the way of details. It states that the company will return to being a “small and nimble studio.” They also state that, while they’re separating, they are looking into a “possible partnership” with Microsoft. Explaining, “Our friends at Activision and Microsoft have been extremely supportive of our new direction, and we’re confident that we will continue to work closely together as part of our future.”\n\n\nThat’s somewhat surprising, considering Toys for Bob was reportedly among those hit by the massive wave of Microsoft layoffs in the wake of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Don’t burn any bridges, I suppose.\n\n\nToys for Bob says it's in the early days of developing its next game and is looking forward to providing more updates.\n\n\nThis news comes shortly after the news that Saber Interactive and Gearbox are being sold off by Embracer Group. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic and even following that, we say a period of rapid acquisitions from companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Embracer. In the fallout of that, there have been a dizzying number of layoffs and studio closures, so seeing a developer spin-off on their own is almost refreshing.\n\nThe post Toys for Bob separating from Activision Blizzard, going independent appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bloomberg is reporting that Saber Interactive, the developers reportedly working on a remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, is being sold by Embracer Group to a private investment group.\n\n\nEmbracer Group has been going through a massive restructuring that has seen hundreds of employees laid off and the shuttering of studios. This latest deal appears to be another part of that ongoing effort.\n\n\nWhile the state of the Knights of the Old Republic remake is currently in question, Saber Interactive is slated to release a few games this year, including Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2, Toxic Commando, and Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game. It’s currently not known how the sale will affect their current projects, which also include Jurassic Park: Survival. \n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg’s source, the deal is worth $500 million. Saber was part of Embracer’s big buying spree. They purchased the company back in 2020 at a reported price of $525 million, which means a bit of a loss. Furthermore, Bloomberg is reporting that the price also “includes an option for Saber to bring along multiple Embracer subsidiaries.” While this might just be referring to Saber’s branches in other countries, there are other studios listed under them, such as 3DRealms and Tripwire.\n\n\nIt’s possible that more of these sales will happen as Embracer continues its efforts to restructure. During their previous fiscal reports, the corporation has stated that they are in “the final stretch” of their restructuring, but it’s currently unknown what else is planned.\n\nThe post KOTOR remake developer Saber Interactive to leave Embracer Group appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s not the franchise’s first foray into video games. A 2017 game called&nbsp;Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.&nbsp;</p>",

The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.</p>\n\n<p>The app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pokémon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year.

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
