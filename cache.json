This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL.

The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games. \"The curse,\" say the organisers, \"is lifted.\" \nRead more",

Finally, a game brave enough to ask: \"what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?\".\nIt's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.\nRead more",

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.\n Read more",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

Maybe one of your toes.\nAnd now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a \"misunderstanding\".\n Read more",

I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.\n Read more",

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

Once you reach the island, you'll notice areas where a storm is taking place (marked by the whirlpools). You'll find a Pirate Ship parked close to these whirlpools. Jump on the ship and you'll meet Captain Neptune on it.\n\n\nOnce you talk with him, you'll receive the only task of this mini-quest.\n\n\n\n\nHow to complete the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest in Fisch\n\n\nOnce you've begun the quest, you'll have to complete the Atlantean Storm Bestiary. This Bestiary includes eight permanent fishes of varying rarities. To catch them, you'll have to fish in the regions where the whirlpools are situated. Make sure to check out this guide, which details all eight species that you'll need to find.\n\n\nDo note that the fish spawn at all times, but you'll have to alter your setup based on which species you want to find. Once you complete the Bestiary, head back to the Pirate Ship. Talk to Captain Neptune and inform him that you have completed the Bestiary.\n\n\nYou'll get x4 Hangman's Hook, x5 Kraken Tentacle, and a Drifter's Tale Bobber by completing the quest.

Once you find the storm, take your boat, and start fishing in the region. \n\n\nThis is likely going to be the final piece of content before the Atlantis core update is released. It's almost a month since we received the Northern Expedition, and plenty of major additions are expected next week.

Rowling somehow managed to carve a world that resonated with an entire generation and continues to pull them back in time and again years later. \n\n\nI’m not ashamed to admit that I love the world of Harry Potter. I was pulled in with the first book at the age of seven, and despite a now much deeper understanding of where Rowling may have gotten her ideas from, the Wizarding World has always had its hooks in me to some degree. As I grew up, I found myself yearning for a more realistic ending, where perhaps everything didn’t get tied up in a neat bow with the name “Weasley” on the gift tag. \n\n\nThat’s where fan fiction comes in. \n\n\nTalented fans of …",

          "description": "The Secret Banana Fish has been on the lips of every Fisch player ever since its appearance was made viral on social media, and many have tried to figure out how to catch it inside the game.\n\n\nThe name of the fish started doing the rounds after an image and video were shown by Kazer, who's pretty well known in the Fisch community. Interestingly, you can't officially catch this fish if you believe the developers. Yet, there's a backdoor approach you can take to catch this peculiar species.\n\n\nHow to catch Secret Banana Fish in Fisch\n\n\nThe Banana Fish is elusive for a reason, as it's a Developer/Admin fish. In simpler terms, it's not a part of the official Bestiary associated with any region, and cannot be caught by normal players. It can only be caught either by admins or by content creators who are directly partnered for producing Fisch-related content.\n\n\nInterestingly, there was even a wiki page stating the steps to take if you wanted to catch this fish. Since then, the page has been taken down, but there might be plans for the Banana Fish to be added to the Fisch Bestiary in the future. If you're unwilling to wait, here's all the information you need to know.\n\n\n\nName: Banana\n\n\nRarity: Secret\n\n\nLocation: Ancient Isle\n\n\nWeather: Rain\n\n\nVersions: 2 (Shiny and Standard)\n\n\nSeason: Summer\n\n\nTime: None\n\n\nPreferred Bait: None\n\n\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen if the developers will add the Banana Fish to the official Bestiary. For a long time, the Travis Scott Secret Fish wasn't available in the full game, but it was later added for the public. Once added, we will add more information to this piece regarding how you can add it to your Bestiary.\n\nThe post Can you catch the Secret Banana Fish in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Dimensional Finger is one of the several items available inside Jujutsu Infinite, but the game doesn't make it clear how you can obtain it.\n\n\nThere are certain items you can also craft from the Crafting Station, and this also includes a few Special Grade drops. However, the Dimensional Finger item can't be crafted with the help of any other resource. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this specific item in the first place and what's its best use-case scenario in Jujutsu Infinite.\n\n\nHow to obtain Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nTo get Dimensional Finger, you'll have to clear the main storyline. You'll come across different NPCs who are directly linked with the main set of quests. Interacting with them allows you to start and complete different quests and unlock a variety of rewards.\n\n\nYour first opportunity to obtain Dimension Finger can be found in Shijo Town's Level 30 quests, where you'll need to defeat the Rogue Sorcerer. Once you defeat the Sorcerer, you'll be able to get a Dimensional Finger.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nThe Dimensional Finger is required to travel across different portals. These portals are found in the villages, and you'll need the item in discussion to shift through them. Once you enter the rifts, you'll find different Cursed Spirits and other types of enemies. Once you take them down, you'll get a lot of credits and XP.\n\n\nAdditionally, taking down these enemies also helps you to get more valuable rewards like Cursed Tools and Special Grade items. Of course, the rewards won't be the same in every run, but entering and clearing these portals is pretty rewarding in general. Whenever you have a Dimensional Finger and come across a portal, make sure to enter and clear out the enemies.\n\nThe post How to get and use the Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Nintendo being in the limelight again because of their long-awaited announcement of the Switch 2’s announcement, does that mean Marvel Rivals is coming to Nintendo’s hybrid consoles?\n\n\nIs Marvel Rivals on Switch?\n\n\nAs of now, Marvel Rivals is not on the Nintendo Switch. This is most likely due to the hardware’s very outdated specs. Since the game isn’t even on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One consoles, it would only make sense. \n\n\nThese three consoles are on the verge of finally being sunsetted as there’s less support for this generation in terms of new games. Besides, performance issues will be a huge problem if this game were ported to last-gen consoles.\n\n\nIs Marvel Rivals coming to the Switch?\n\n\nIt’s highly unlikely that this game will be coming to the Switch. As it stands right now, nothing major is really releasing for Nintendo’s hybrid console other than some remasters, ports, and collections.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nIs Marvel Rivals coming to Switch 2?\n\n\nWith the Switch 2 coming later in 2025, we do not fully know if Marvel Rivals will be released on that platform. \n\n\nWe do not even know the fully confirmed specs of the console yet, so it’ll be hard to determine if that will be a possibility or not. \n\n\nRumors and leaks suggest that it’ll have capabilities between a PS4 and PS4 Pro, which is a big upgrade for Nintendo. However, the specs still do not compare to those of a base PS5 or an Xbox Series console. \n\n\nSince players, namely on the PC side, have dealt with and are still now dealing with the 99% error, shader errors, and other miscellaneous problems, that won’t be all too well for players on inferior hardware.\n\n\nWhether or not Marvel Rivals will be coming to the Switch 2 (at the most), we’ll be sure to let you know any further updates on the matter. \n\nThe post Is Marvel Rivals on Switch?

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

          "description": "Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen \"věci na jistotu\" jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)",

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
