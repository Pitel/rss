We have been reporting on the semiconductor shortage for some time now, detailing Switch assembly issues and the company's uncertainty concerning future Switch production numbers. Now, it seems like Nintendo is trying another tactic to reduce costs and keep up the shipment of consoles as best it can.\nAs reported by Nikkei (thanks, Next News Report), Nintendo will be reducing the size of its Switch packaging by 20% in order to increase the efficiency of its console transportation services.

          "description": "Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. \nHappily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for. \nRead more",

A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.\nWe Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.\nRead more",

          "description": "Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.\nEven with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.\nRead more",

          "description": "Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.\r\n\n\r\nSo, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.\nYou play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.\nRead more",

I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

Now, it's not a stunner as far as looks go, and it's not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it's far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it's been reduced from a UK RRP of £170. \nRead more",

I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?\nAfter spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats.

As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.\nWhere am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.\nThis, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.\nRead more",

Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. \nIt tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.\nRead more",

          "description": "Elden Ring's patch 1.06 offers dozens of small tweaks that should make your journey across The Land Between just a little easier. The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that'll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Original article follows below: \nThe XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer's official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it's also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price. \nRead more",

          "description": "Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they're the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

On paper, it looks like it'll have the same basic two-lane layout as the core one, but with a few changes.\nWhat's different about the new Pokemon Unite map Theia Sky Runs:\nRayquaza is the boss in the middle\nJungling will be different, with new layouts\nIt has a new aesthetic\nIt's not a complete departure from the norm, which is honestly OK. When Unite tries to go for far-out wild pitches, it can often miss. So having a layout that's mostly the same but has a complete visual reboot is likely for the best. After a year of playing on the same tired arena, it'll be great to finally get another option.\nOf course, details are very slim, as is customary for the game. The only tease we're given is to \"stay tuned for future information,\" so it's unclear how this map will rotate, or if it'll completely take over the original battleground for a while.\nAs usual, the Japanese Pokemon Unite site has a page upfront beyond the sole tweet from the English account.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdmbokV5qak\nThe post Pokemon Unite is finally getting a new core map appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"We're not considering that at this point\"\nNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that's the plan anyway.\nFurukawa noted that they are \"not considering\" a Nintendo Switch price hike \"at this point,\" with two factors in play. The chief concern is \"pricing people out,\" given that they're aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).\nAnother potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to \"maintain the momentum\" of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn't with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that \"demand exceeds supply.\"\nSo how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the \"OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models,\" because \"costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea.\" But he also notes: \"The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We're making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that.\"\n[Update: Nikkei also reports that Nintendo is reducing their packaging materials by 20% for the Switch, to help with \"transportation efficiency,\" and allow more use of air mail (as well as more shelf space). Right now Nintendo is trying this strategy with the original Switch model.\"\nThe post Nintendo president says no Switch price hike is coming (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rave from the Grave?\nA staggering eight years on from its initial teaser, there is fresh evidence that zombie-mashing sequel Dead Island 2 is almost ready to grace us with its putrid presence. Online retailer Amazon has opened a new listing for the \"Is it even happening?\" release, complete with a launch date of February 3, 2023.\n\nThe listing includes box art, screenshots, and a game description, which is more than anybody has seen of Dead Island 2 from publisher Deep Silver or developer Dambuster Studios. According to Amazon, the sequel is ready to rock on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, (current and last-gen), and will, once again, see players choose from a selection of characters before engaging in gory, open-world mayhem on the streets of a plague-ridden Los Angeles. The blurb also suggests that the heroes themselves are infected, and can utilize the zombie inside them to unleash further carnage.\n\nIt's the best evidence yet that Dead Island 2 is not only still on deck, but is, apparently, mere months away from launch. Originally announced with a memorable teaser trailer at E3 2014, the sequel has since bounced through several studios and has been subject to an array of cancellation rumors. Can the long-awaited title deliver after being mired in development hell? It seems, according to Amazon at least, that we really don't have to wait too much longer to find out.\nWith Gamescom on the horizon, I would expect that we'll be hearing some official news from Deep Silver in the very near future.\nDead Island 2 is currently in development at Dambuster Studios.\nThe post Dead Island 2 listed on Amazon with art, screens, and Feb 2023 date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The wacky multiplayer survival action game led with PS4 and PS5 as its only platforms, but GungHo Online and Supertrick Games confirmed a PC version in a live developer stream with Uncle Death.\nA couple of weeks ago, Deathverse committed to a fall 2022 release window, after previously eying a spring launch. The delay came about in the wake of an open beta test.\n\"We got a lot of data from the beta,\" explained game director Hideyuki Shin, \"and we're planning to make as many adjustments as we can.\"\nSome of the world-building vibes and close-up combat antics will feel familiar to Let It Die fans, but Deathverse has carved out a different path with 16-player Death Jamboree matches, in which participants try to stay alive long enough to duke it out in the Showdown Zone. All the while, powerful hunters can join the fray, and cryptids — including the chupacabra and jackalope — mingle with the hyperviolent contestants.\n[caption id=\"attachment_340294\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Weapons are important, but don't neglect fashion.[/caption]\nThe goal is to be bold enough to earn GP (Good Points) and power up, but not be so bold that you bite off more than you can chew and get taken out. Classic battle royale strats.\nLet It Die surprisingly ended up having the right stuff — it accumulated millions of players. Whether Deathverse: Let It Die can capture lightning in a bottle again, I'm not so sure, but anything's possible. Having the game accessible on not just PS4/PS5, but also Steam, where free-to-play audiences have a chance to really snowball, feels crucial.\nIf nothing else, it warms my heart to know that Uncle Death's still a jokester.\nThe post Deathverse: Let It Die is also coming to PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A musical miniseries with a surprising amount of heart\nI wasn’t sure what to expect with We Are OFK. Based on the trailer, I thought it was going to be the usual fare we get with episodic, choice-based narratives (which I love). When I started playing, I was surprised to find that We Are OFK is less of a game and more of an animated miniseries with interactive elements, including music videos. It made a lot more sense that it was recommended to me to play on “whatever [my] preferred TV watching setup is.” We Are OFK is also considered a biopic by its creators, and while I'd more categorize it as a memoir, the point is that the project is a fictional telling of the forming of a real virtual band, which sounds more confusing than it is.\nWhen I sat down to write this review, I thought a lot a…",

Choosing tutelage under the banner of one of Fire Emblem's \"Three Houses\" — The Black Eagles, The Golden Deer, or The Blue Lions — Shez and their newfound allies against the might of the Empire. Three Hopes, as the name denotes, offers three distinct but interconnected tales depending on the player's school of choice.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f91wvxXAEXw\nOnce out on the battlefield, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes features the typical hack 'n' slash action that one would associate with Koei Tecmo's Warriors titles. Considered a major improvement on 2017's Fire Emblem Warriors, Three Hopes has won acclaim from both critics and the Fire Emblem fan community for its wide roster of playable characters and engaging combat, though it has also been criticized for its repetition and lack of technical growth over its Warriors brethren.

His latest set of tweets involves his updated Sakurai gaming setup, which has decidedly gone vertical.\nIn a series of photos, he shows off his made-to-order shelves, which house numerous gaming consoles. Visibly, we can see an Xbox Series X, PS5, Switch, PS4, PS3, Wii U (!), Famicom (NES), Genesis, and SNES. The top plate and back are removed to push out heat, and he leaves the door open when playing. Adorably, he has a few controllers labeled with tiny little stickers, like \"Xbox X\" or \"2\" (presumably for player two). Those same labels adorn the power cables that plug into the wall (and the power supplies can be turned off individually).\nAn updated look at the Masahiro Sakurai gaming setup:\nhttps://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1559806360329392128\nThe most curious element is easily the horizontally-docked Switch. He even had to post a response tweet because of it! Here's what he said: \"There was a reaction to the Switch dock horizontal placement...it's not recommended by the manufacturer, so do it at your own risk. This is just my personal experience, but I had no problems using it until I cleared Xenoblade Chronicles 3.\" Well, if Sakurai says it's okay! To be frank I never even really considered it, but it looks awesome on certain shelves.\nIf you're curious, PushDustIn chronicled Sakurai's previous setup in 2019 here.

          "description": "You only need one button\nNinja or Die is a peculiar name for a game, but I took a look at the ninja-slaying roguelite on Steam and I'm intrigued by... all of this. It's so fast and flashy, I can hardly keep up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94IVbgfT0p0\nI've watched the trailer for Ninja or Die a few times now, and I'm still piecing it together; slow-mo helps, but I doubt it will fully click until we've tried playing it.\nNao Games and Marvelous Europe are hoping to blend \"hardcore action\" with \"simple controls,\" and I'm curious to see how that will pan out once the training wheels are off. Specifically, Ninja or Die uses one-button controls. \"Jump to where you point, eviscerate the enemy by dashing through them, and hold to attack with greater power.\"\nThe setup is that you're a secret agent in a \"ninja-eat-ninja world\" with bosses to bring down and hordes of smaller creeps to cut through. As a roguelite experience, death is a part of the deal and you'll accumulate perma-upgrades as well as alternate characters. You can power up your stats back at the village or \"pay the back-alley doctor.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_340023\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Those pesky Big Kite Ninjas.[/caption]\nAs opposed to some recent roguelites, Ninja or Die seems to emphasize high scores and replayability over a loop-based format that's servicing a larger story. On that note, levels are \"a mix\" of procedural and hand-crafted, and there's an Infinite Watchtower to run.\nThe pieces might not all add up in the end, but the strangeness appeals to me. I just hope that when I'm the one leaping around Japan like a madman, I have a better sense of my busy surroundings. From the outside looking in, readability is a concern.\nAs luck would have it, there's a browser-based demo to get a feel for it.\nAnother one for the wait-and-see wishlist?

We've known that Overwatch 2 will have cross-progression for a while, and today Blizzard is explaining just how all of it will work.\nCross-progression means that all progression and in-game cosmetics in Overwatch 2 will span across different systems. While previously having, say, a fancy Tracer skin on PlayStation 4 didn't mean you could access it on PC, the new system will merge and allow you to use the skin on both.\nStarting today on August 16, players with a linked console account will be allowed to identify and confirm the accounts they want to merge. Once approved, the accounts will be prepared to merge on Overwatch 2's release. You'll need a Battle.net account no matter what, and all progress from the linked accounts will be stored on the Battle.net account.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aB-H8QFXA0\nAs Blizzard notes with red text and emphasis, there is just one opportunity to merge accounts. Make sure you check which accounts are being merged when you do so.\nThe Blizzard explainer goes into further detail, including addressing a few specific circumstances some players might run into during the merge process. All of this should serve to provide a central platform, similar to games like Fortnite, where cosmetics purchased in one place will be available on the others as well.\nOne giant closet of cosmetics\nAs Overwatch 2 moves the game from loot boxes to passes and a shop, having that access is a good thing. It's doubly so, since Overwatch 2 will also be taking the place of Overwatch on its launch; like a massive title update for the multiplayer side. The single-player part of Overwatch 2, meanwhile, is expected to arrive sometime later on in the future.\nOverwatch 2 will go live and free-to-play on October 4 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nThe post Blizzard details how cross-progression will work with Overwatch 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the wake of launching its latest game, Astro's Playroom, as a PlayStation 5 pack-in title, its next project will be its biggest one yet.\nIn a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, creative and studio director Nicolas Doucet talks about some of what Asobi's been up to post-Playroom. Team Asobi is looking to keep tooling around with the DualSense, a key part of Astro's Playroom. And it's also looking to expand in scope, too.\nDoucet says Asobi's next game will follow in the footsteps of its previous games, will be a full-blown commercial title, and will be the \"biggest to date\" for the studio.\nThe team at Asobi has been steadily expanding, going from 35 to 60 members. Doucet expects that number to reach around 100. And the makeup is largely Japanese, which Doucet says the team wants to reflect in the games they make.\n\"We want to make sure that when people play our games that there is a feeling, and you can't quite put your finger on it, that it's made in Japan,\" said Doucet. You can find the full interview with GIbiz here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu5VXrEqgco\nAstro's evolution\nTeam Asobi has been on a steady rise for some time. Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered one of the better PlayStation VR games around. And Astro's Playroom was a delightful pack-in console launch game. The platformer harbored tons of nostalgia for the history of PlayStation and its hardware.\nDoucet and the team at Asobi have a clear penchant for working with the nuances of Sony's hardware.

And, as leaked by the Xbox dash yesterday, two new characters joining the star-studded roster are DC Comics anti-hero Black Adam, and the mischievous-to-the-point-of-deadly gremlin, Stripe.\nAs is the modus operandi of sneaky PC types, dataminers wasted zero time digging into the files of MultiVersus' season one update — hoping to find any and all evidence of some unannounced DLC characters. And it seems that their search was a smashing success, after the discovery of a huge batch of voice lines spouted by the irrepressible Beetlejuice, the unpredictable and darkly witty \"bio-exorcist\" from Tim Burton's class…",

However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. \nThat could change soon as Dying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: \n\n\n\"What dangers await?\" a press release reads. \"How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal.\" \nAs you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Dying Light 2 review and then read our interview about the future of Dying Light 2. \nAre you excited about this DLC?

Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.\nThe action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.\n\nIf it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.\nThe new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.",

Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. \n“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.\n“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.” \nan extensive FAQ that you can check out here with answers to questions like, “how do I merge my accounts?” and more.",

The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. \nThe description of the event reads as follows:\nThe Fortnite Dragon Ball Crossover awaits die-hard fans today. \n[Source: Gamespot]",

This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a \"sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.\" \nJUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F\nAugust 15, 2022\nYou might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. \nConsidering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9. \nWhat Marvel heroes do you hope Hennig's game features?

That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” \n“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” \nWētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” \n“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. \nThis new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). \nWhile waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. \nDevil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.\nCheck it out for yourself below: \nWelcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD\nAugust 11, 2022\nAs you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18. \nFor more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, check out the game’s first extended gameplay reveal from earlier this summer, and then read our preview of the game after checking it out in June.

The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). \nNightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. \nSo far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.",

The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld's usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). \nThe film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. \n\n\nSnow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I'm excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.",

Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version. \n[Source: Faz on YouTube via Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of the game running at 60 FPS?

          "description": "Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” \nArc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",
