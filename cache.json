Nintendo's coffers have been spilling over throughout the Switch's cycle and it could have easily gone on an Embracer-style spending spree during the COVID boom years, but that's not its style. With Embracer Group now restructuring, the Swedish company's loss is Nintendo's gain.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Paper, un-jammed.\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the standard for Mario RPGs for 20 years. It, alongside its N64 predecessor, captured what fans wanted from their turn-based, plumber-starring adventures – silly humour, epic adventures, fantastic combat, and charm. Purists often view the GameCube original as the end of the 'true' Paper Mario style – a little bit unfair, perhaps, when Super Paper Mario and The Origami King are both great, if undeniably different from that original formula.\nIt should be no surprise that the Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door was celebrated upon its announcement. Even if you like other Paper Mario titles, it’s hard to argue that Thousand-Year Door wasn't a high point for the plumber, not just in the RPG space but in Mario’s wider canon. Two decades later, that still holds true, and now the best Mario RPG is finally more accessible.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A light bite.\nCapcom is one of the titans of the gaming industry, and among its most successful and powerful franchises is Monster Hunter. Yet it’s easy to forget that, for many years, the series was exclusive to one platform holder – first Sony systems and then a spell with Nintendo starting with Monster Hunter Tri on Wii. On top of repeated exclusivity, it took a while to establish much of a footing outside of Japan, and even then it was still impenetrable and inaccessible for a lot of gamers. Too difficult, demanding, time-consuming, or downright unintuitive — outside of a dedicated base of fans (this scribe included), it was largely ignored.\nGradually, oh so gradually, Capcom decided to make the series more accessible. The mainline games began to add more mobility and gameplay styles in the Nintendo era, nowhere near as open to a wide audience as Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, but on the way to reaching more players. The 3DS entries in particular started that push but still eventually beat up hunters that dared to reach the endgame; then Monster Hunter Stories arrived on Nintendo’s little system and offered an alternative, a gentle hug as an introduction to the series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries.

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming.

And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.\nRead more",

If so, you'll probably love the smell of Valheim's Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.\nRead more",

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch \"later this month\", say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's \"distinct style\". \nRead more",

Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an \"official cinematic world premiere trailer\" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.\nAlso, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.\nRead more",

Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.",

          "description": "Warframe's rich mechanical meta gives an abundance of ways to build your Frame, but as you progress through content, survivability becomes more and more of a pressing issue. Whether it's high-level Elite Sanctuary Onslaught, Steel Path or Sorties, understanding how to use shield gating can give your Warframe survivability for any situation.\n\n\nShield gating is a technique in Warframe that relies on the brief period of invulnerability that every Warframe gets when their shields break. When a Warframe's shield hits 0, any damage they took over the shield is nullified rather than spilling onto their health bar, and they become very briefly invulnerable. This prevents players from losing their entire shield and health pool to a single hit, and means that less resilient Frames can’t be taken out…",

          "description": "Developer Caracal Games' first-person parkour platformer Downward first launched back in July 2017, and now it's set to return with some updates. Downward Enhanced  throws updated graphics and more into the mix when it hits consoles and PC on June 4, 2024.\n\n\nBeyond the visual improvements — which include some new assets —the enhanced version adds optimization and a new ending. Those who already own the base game will be able to upgrade to Downward Enhanced with a free update. You can see more of the dizzying, post-apocalyptic parkour feats in action in the release date trailer below.  \n\n\n\n\nSimilar to games like Mirror's Edge but perhaps not quite as disorienting as VR attempts like Stride, Downward has you jumping, sliding, hanging, and running along walls. This time around, however, you'll be doing so in a ruined world in search of legendary artifacts and an explanation for the apocalypse that brought us to this point in the first place.\n\n\nAlong the way, you can upgrade your powers and boost your stats to give yourself an edge against some of the Ancient Guardians that want to put an end to all those pesky acrobatics. There's also a balance of world exploration that has you using those parkour skills to find hidden items and secret locations.\n\n\nIt's not easy to make first-person platforming work in any meaningful way, so when a developer gets it even partially right, I tend to pay attention. When Downward Enhanced launches, you'll be able to jump into \"humanity's final adventure\" on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. \n\nThe post First-person parkour platformer Downward returns with enhanced version on June 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "XDefiant allows players to meet and compete across multiple maps and modes. Like many online-only arena shooters, the game places its players on regional servers to best guarantee the smoothest gameplay. But if you're looking to change your region in XDefiant, you may come up wanting. \n\n\nYou cannot change your region in XDefiant. This isn't exactly unique to the game, either. Ubisoft, like many game developers, places players in local servers to ensure the lowest ping, so that the salty feelings are more likely to stem from skill issues rather than matchmaking lag. I can't help you if an enemy player spawns behind you, mind. That's just arena shooters, baby.\n\n\nYou can reach out to Ubisoft and ask to change your region, but I doubt it'll be easy to persuade the publisher.

There seem to be some growing pains with XDefiant, and Ubisoft is working to fix the issues. If you are running into connection problems, be sure to look toward our guides on how to fix the Practice Zone or the \"can't find game\" and \"unable to find match\" errors.\n\n\nIf those aren't the errors you're looking for, fret not. Try restarting the game, resetting your router, or reinstalling. You may need to wait for a fix if those steps don't help. As it is with many new online games, the high demand can often cause server problems that the developer has to clear up. Be sure to follow the official XDefiant account on X for updates and keep your eye on the game's server status.\n\nThe post XDefiant: Can you change your region? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Raven Software announced that Ashika Island will be removed from Warzone on May 30. The devs did not share if the Resurgence map will ever return, but it won't return for the rest of Modern Warfare 3's lifespan. \n\n\n\"We're directing our focus toward other map-mode combinations for upcoming playlist updates.

The next CoD title will reportedly launch in late October, and nothing has been revealed yet about the next Warzone installment. \n\n\nGiven that MW3's iteration of Warzone released new versions of Fortune's Keep and Rebirth Island, it's not totally out of the question that Raven Software could do something similar next year.

With its launch, you get access to the Unranked, Ranked Trial, and Practice Zone. That is if one of them wasn't completely greyed out. Here's how to fix the XDefiant Practice Zone not working.\n\n\nCan you fix the XDefiant Practice Zone being greyed out?\n\n\nAs of writing, the XDefiant Practice Zone is unavailable. No matter what challenges you manage to complete or whatever menus you access, the Practice Zone will continue to remain greyed out. The reason for this hasn't been disclosed by Ubisoft, but it's possible that the game's intermittent server issues might have something to do with it. No matter what it is, you'll need to wait for further updates from Ubisoft before getting access to it.\n\n\nOnce you do have access to the Practice Zone, it has several areas that can help you improve your skills. Notably, there's a training course that tests how fast you can run through various environmental obstacles while destroying targets. This helps improve your aim on the fly while helping you get from point A to point B as quickly as possible.\n\n\nIn the meantime, they always say that practice makes perfect. Unranked isn't as serious as Ranked, so it can make for a good testing ground not just for your skills, but also for testing loadouts. One such aspect of loadouts is through the faction you choose. You can see the list of factions in our guide.\n\nThe post How to fix XDefiant Practice Zone not working appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hellblade 2 mostly focuses on two forms of gameplay, traversal and combat. It always flips between the two, with the traversal interwoven with narrative beats. \n\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean the game isn't afraid to shake things up with some light puzzle-solving. One such puzzle can scratch some heads, as it's the first major puzzle you'll encounter. Here's how to open the village gate in Hellblade 2.\n\n\nHow to find the symbols for the village gate in Hellblade 2\n\n\nThis puzzle appears during Chapter 2 of Hellblade 2, when exploring the Draugar-ravaged village of Freyslaug. As you approach a bridge leading to the remainder of the village, a gate appears showing a complex rune. This is split into three separate symbols, all of which you need to find in the village to progress.\n\n\nThe first symbol is located in the house immediately to the left of the bridge. Head inside and take the ladder up. On the overlook, you can find the left side of the rune by focusing at the right angle.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe second symbol is the easiest of the bunch, found as a pyre in the town center with a red hue. Simply get the right angle, and you'll have the middle of the rune.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe final symbol can be found on the far outskirts of town and is the best hidden of the bunch. To reach it, you need to enter a house on the right side of the village gate and enter its backyard, then climb up on the nearby hill.

          "description": "Following critical hits with 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Unicorn Overlord—which has done pretty well for itself—developer Vanillaware has some hints as to what it's working on next. According to a recent tweet, the studio is actively recruiting staff for a \"new fantasy action-RPG.\" \n\n\nThe recruitment flyer says Vanillaware is on the hunt for programmers, 2D animators, and background designers (via Gematsu). While details are understandably light, you can see the notice below. It describes the genre, notes that they're recruiting development staff, and lists the above roles. \n\n\n\n\nVanillaware has spent the better part of the past 20 years jumping back and forth between a few different genres. Its latest efforts, 13 Sentinels and Unicorn Overlord, were a time-spanning adventure and a medieval strategy-RPG, respectively. Members of the Vanillaware team and Atlus recently spoke with Destructoid about the development process, where they got the inspiration for Unicorn Overlord's scenario and setting, and more.\n\n\nPrior to those, Vanillaware partnered with Atlus to release fantasy action-RPG Dragon's Crown. Most of their games have some degree of fantasy to them, fitting the requested bill for the next project nicely. Grand Knights History hit PSP as a Japan-only title in 2011, and before that they put out titles like Muramasa: The Demon Blade, Odin Sphere, and GrimGrimoire. \n\n\nSome of those games have been re-released via remasters and enhanced ports, which is why the \"new\" before \"fantasy action-RPG\" is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting in this listing. Since they're still looking for staff, it might be a while before we hear anything else about it. Whatever Vanillaware is cooking up, it will most definitely look gorgeous, at the very least.\n\nThe post Vanillaware is looking for developers to work on a new fantasy action-RPG appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.\nOur first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!!

          "description": "Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule. \nWhat do you think this new iteration will be?

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

          "description": "Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.\nThis dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless.

Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nSimilar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices.

Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

          "description": "Dungeons & Dragons has a big year ahead of it. The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game's core rules, including the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.\nThe books aren’t far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.\nWe had the good fortune to visit Wizards of the…",

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. \nOriginally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. \n\n\nAt 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. \nOn the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year. \nFor more about PlayStation, read about how Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino have been named dual CEOs of the company, and then read Game Informer's Stellar Blade review. After that, check out Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. \nHow do you feel about the PlayStation 5 at this point in its lifecycle? Let us know in the comments below!",

Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers. \nMidsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.\n\n\nThe company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” \n“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”\nMidsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.",

It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. \nDeveloper Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. \n\n\nArrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. \nAs announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!\n@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…\nMay 14, 2024\nNotably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about how PlayStation recently walked back its Helldivers 2 PlayStation Network changes. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you one of the 12 million Helldivers 2 players?
