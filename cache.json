So many of our favourite experiences are enhanced and in part defined by the soundtrack, and we can see this in the love shown towards iconic tracks. Fan-made performances and arrangements are easy to find, and some of them do brilliant things with the source material.\nOne upcoming album that looks likely to do just that is 'Hyrule Highlands II' - it's the work of Tim de Man, a one-man Celtic and Folk band. The first album in this series is above and is fantastic, and for the follow up they've teamed up with ZREO: Second Quest, which helped with the new mixes and promotion. Hyrule Highlands II launches on Bandcamp on 24th May, where it can be purchased for $10USD or more, before dropping on all major streaming services on 7th June. Picking it up on Bandcamp gets you a \"music video featuring Tim de Man, high-resolution front and rear cover art, wallpaper with and without logos in 6K resolution, mobile wallpaper, and a complimentary photo of Tim.\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive were brimming with a huge variety of games. But when Sony's PlayStation hit in 1995, it was an indication of another huge shake-up in the video game industry — though even then, there was something more concerning happening behind the scenes.\nIn a newly translated article from the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun dated February 29 1996 (translated by Gryson from Mega Drive Shock), it's revealed that there was a huge decline in 16-bit sales in the year 1995, with one industry expert even saying “It’s almost like a return of the 1982 Atari Shock\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The latest, from prolific glitch enthusiast channel Gaming Reinvented, allows you to take your horse to places it's never been before: up a mountain full of hot, flaming lava.\nThe trick essentially allows you to semi-permanently freeze your horse, thereby granting it immunity to the overwhelming heat found within the Elden Region. As described in the video below, you'll need to head on over to the Woodland Tower, leap off, and use your glider to mosey on down to an area near to the Woodland stable.

In a teaser video shared on Twitter and YouTube, it looks like we're going to Beast's Castle, as the racers swerve past the Enchanted Rose and between teacups in this Beauty and the Beast-inspired course.\nThe track looks like it's set partially on a grand dinner table, adorned with treats, plates, cutlery, glasses, and more. Then, later on, there are library walls full of books, and ticking clock pendulums that get in your way. Sounds like Beast took some inspiration from Mario Kart DS' Tick Tock Clock, there! These little references to Chip and Cogsworth from the 1991 film are charming, and we hope Lumière, Mrs. Potts, Wardrobe, and others, will get their own highlights.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The hits keep coming.\n\nWhen Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp was postponed earlier this year in response to current events in Ukraine, there was an interesting perspective that did the rounds. It meant a longer than normal gap between Nintendo retail titles, and we'd have to wait — gasp — for a few weeks to play Kirby and the Forgotten Land. Likewise with the delay of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 to 'Spring 2023'; as it stands we'll only have a new Pokémon generation to enjoy this Holiday season. Gosh, tough times, though of course Nintendo will have a Direct or two to come that'll likely fill even more gaps. We were disappointed to see Zelda pushed back to next year, but there's no shortage of other Switch games to occupy our twiddling thumbs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Sounds good.\nWhen playing an instrument, it can be thrilling to finally nail that song that you’ve been trying to master for some time. Rhythm games are built on this concept, challenging you to replay levels as many times as needed until you get it perfect. Sometimes rhythm mechanics even work well in other genres — just look at how Runner3 manages to pull off a rhythmic platformer. But what if we tried making a twin-stick shooter with rhythm elements? You’d probably get something a lot like Soundfall, the inaugural release from Drastic Games, a studio formed from Epic Games alumni. Though Soundfall doesn’t quite have the pipes to hit the high notes, it nonetheless provides an enjoyable action experience that’s quite unlike anything else on Switch eShop right now.\nSoundfall places you in the role of Melody, a down-on-her-luck barista with incredible musical ability that largely goes unrealized. Before leaving for work one day, Melody sits down to listen to some music and finds herself transported away to a magical musical world called Symphonia. This is the place from which all music comes, but Melody’s arrival is not necessarily a good sign. There’s a rising power of evil monsters called Discordians that threaten the creation of music, and it’s up to Melody and friends to rise to their role as Guardians of Harmony and thwart the discordant threat.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like.

          "description": "AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. \r\n\n\r\nThe lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

          "description": "Loot River, the pixely roguelike with a bit of Souls and a bit of Tetris, is all about making multiple attempts to navigate weird dungeons made of moving platforms, before dying and starting again. It's one of those games that's perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that's going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn't realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they've already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot? \nRead more",

She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's \"weird and creepy\", and has recently been looking for something new to play. \"I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,\" she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. \nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure. \nRead more",

They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP.

          "description": "Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.\nUpon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.\nRead more",

          "description": "I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.\nThat realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.\nRead more",

It’s easy to get lost in its tranquil cycle of collecting stamps via fetch quests and combat. However, Rising doesn’t have much substance. The whole experience is bland and commits various RPG transgressions, which is disappointing.

          "description": "Kerbal Space Program 2 will remain grounded a while longer. Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.\nCreative director Nate Simpson explained on the project's forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: \n“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” \n\n\nLike its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. \nKerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.\nUnfortunately, Kerbal isn't the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.",

But the news for Warner Bros.' brawler doesn't stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.\nLooney Toons' Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo's Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week's alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won't make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.\nA later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you're not able to get into the closed alpha, you'll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. \nIf you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game's website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.",

If you're a PC player, good thing the modding community is particularly generous with its wacky experiments.

The new feature is kind of like spirit summoning. As PC Gamer aptly points out, it's akin to Skyrim's follower mechanic, meaning that your party members will likely stay with you even after defeating the big bads of a specific point of interest. Moreover, the various characters were rebalanced to fit Elden Ring's exploratory loop and include, Melina, Sellen, Millicent, Ranni, Blaidd, Malenia (and her Rot form!), Radagon, Morgott, Godfrey, and Maliketh among many others.

We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing 2017's Pyre. \nPyre was released on June 25, 2017. After Supergiant struggled to create Transistor, the team adopted a looser \"anything goes\" approach for Pyre. The game blends together disparate elements reflecting the team's interests such as a high-fantasy setting, a large cast of engaging characters, a ritual in the form of a basketball/soccer-like competition, and Oregon Trail-inspired exploration. Tune in to find out how Supergiant concocted the game's centerpiece \"sports\" game, its approach to crafting a larger branching narrative (including an ever-changing end credit song), and which members of the Nightwings we chose to liberate and the ones we abandoned in the Downside.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with video game consultant and former Game Informer editor Suriel Vazquez (@SurielVazquez) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Pyre!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

It was one of my prized possessions, even though the details were lacking. This version of Luke looked more like an elf from the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer claymation film than actor Mark Hamill. His lightsaber was also oddly yellow instead of blue – a detail I always thought was odd.\nThe point being, action figures have come a LONG way since then. Hot Toys' latest Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness action figure looks so realistic it could be in a wax museum. Benedict Cumberbatch's facial detailing is spot on, and the 30 points of articulation allow for many of his spell-casting poses to be recreated. To make sure these spell motions look just like in the movie, Hot Toys includes over a dozen interchangeable hands with fingers pointing every which way. You'll also find five mystic powers to go along with some of the hands to truly sell the effects of the spell.  \nThe figure is 31 centimeters in height and comes with a variety of accessories, like the Book of Vishanti, two sling rings, an amulet, handcuffs, mystic vipers, and so much more.\nHot Toys hasn't given us a price yet, but it's expected to ship in either the third or fourth quarter of 2023.

After a week away on Madrigal with Kwan and Soren, the focus shifts back to Reach and what the UNSC is doing about finding The Covenant and Halo. While the militaristic arm of humanity panics over other planets getting glassed by their alien foes, John and Makee are spending time getting to know each other after their shared vision of the show's namesake.\nWhile the universe's greatest Spartan and the Covenant spy fraternize in the park (and other places), Dr. Halsey continues to meddle in order to advance humanity in her image, threatening the people she's trying to save in the process. Will the good doctor's interference and the union between the main characters result in unity between the two warring factions or make the upcoming battle that much harder? You'll just have to listen to this week's show to find out.\nWhat do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

Hugh Neutron, the duck-loving meme king and father of Jimmy Neutron, arrives this summer. Lastly, Rocko of Rocko’s Modern Life fame is slated for the fall. \nThe announcement trailer below largely focuses on Jenny, who can pummel opponents with rocket-powered fists, zap them with lasers, slice them up with buzzsaws, and utilize other gadgets. Unfortunately, we don’t get any gameplay footage of Hugh or Rocko, but those videos will likely arrive as we approach each character’s launch dates.\nEach fighter is labeled as premium DLC, meaning they come at a price. You can grab Jenny, her Tremorton Joyride stage, and her alternate costume for $4.99. A Universe Pack containing all three characters, along with the new stages and costumes tied to them, goes for $11.99. \n\n\nNickelodeon All-Star Brawl didn’t blow us away (here’s our review), but it's a respectable platform fighter and it’s cool to see developer Ludosity continue to bolster the roster with fan-favorite characters. One has to wonder if these will be the only new faces to grace the game in 2022 given how spaced out they are, and what characters will be added in 2023, if any. \nAre you still playing Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl?

This expansion adds more than 180 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, 8 Pokémon VStar, 21 Pokémon V, and 2 Pokémon VMax cards. On top of that, Astral Radiance delivers 30 cards with special art in the Trainer Gallery subset, as well as more than 20 Trainer cards.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us a ton of booster packs so we could see what we pull from this newest addition to the TCG. I was pleasantly surprised not only with the Radiant Pokémon I pulled but also by the number of Hisuian Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I loved the Decidueye and Typhlosion cards I secured through these booster packs, as well as the various rideable and Noble Pokémon I recognized from my time in Hisui. If you are hoping to round out your personal collection with more Galar Pokémon, don't worry, as I still found several creatures from Gen VIII's main region.\nHowever, my favorite card is probably one that features a Pokémon I did not anticipate being so excited about: Hoothoot. This serene full-art Battle Region card immediately caught my eye and became the showpiece addition to my collection from this expansion. You can see the full gallery of my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs of the Astral Radiance expansion below:\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Astral Radiance expansion launches on May 27. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

However, what if it was composed in a different style, perhaps as a symphonic metal song? Or maybe a lofi hip-hop track? Well, composer Alex Moukala has done just that and more. In fact, Moukala covered the main theme of Elden Ring in 15 different styles: Spanish Guitar, Nu-Disco, Symphonic Metal, Smooth Jazz, Lofi Hip-Hop, Darksynth, Movie Trailer, Piano Solo, Baroque (my personal favorite), Reggae, Big Room House, French House, Trap x Traditional Japanese (also possibly my favorite), and Orchestral. \n\n\nAs you can see in the video above, there’s not a single style Moukala remixes Elden Ring’s theme into that doesn’t work – if I booted up From Software’s latest, which is great but even better when playing with friends, and any of these started playing, I’d be just as excited as I am when I hear the standard theme. If you like these remixes, you’re in luck because Moukala does this all the time. He has other “X Game In 15 Different Styles” videos, video game trailer music rewrites and re-arrangements, music analyses, and so much more. His entire channel is great!\nFor more Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10 and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes From Software’s next game should prioritize co-op.

In Evil Dead: The Game, don’t expect to find the human heroes cowering in corners or attempting to flee – this 4v1 fear festival takes the fight directly to the forces of evil, hacking enemies in half and blowing them to pieces.\nIn 1981, Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead made a grisly splash onto the horror scene, featuring what’s become an almost formulaic setup: Five unfortunate friends head out to a cabin in the woods for a good time, and then, spoiler alert, good times are not had. The idyllic journey into the country turns into a bloody massacre, spurred on by an ancient evil book known as the Ne…",

          "description": "MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighting game bringing together the WB brands under one brawl-for-all, has finally had its first official look at gameplay with a Pros vs. Devs exhibition. In the 18-minute video, two professional fighting game players, NAKAT and VoiD, square off against developers from Player First Games, director Tony Huynh and principal developer Daniel Kraft, in a 2v2 competition.\nFeast your eyes on the video above to see what actual matches of MultiVersus look like in the format the game was built around: two-on-two team battles. KATAT and VoiD are top competitors in MultiVersus' very early testing, coming in the top spot of a closed alpha team tournament, so the action on-hand is fast-pasted. Only four characters are shown in the video – Tom and Jerry, Superman, Shaggy, and Wonder Woman – but there's plenty to learn about how each character plays if you look closely. We also get a look at the U.I. used in fights, with the numbers representing damage taken on each player always showing directly below that character's model. It took me a little bit to get used to the change over the classic Smash Bros. U.I., but I get how this can be more readable at a glance.\nAlong with this first look at MultiVersus gameplay, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games have announced a 32-team tournament that's set to take place at Evo in August. The prize pool for the event is set at $100,000, laying down the challenge for potentially big payouts for those who place high in the competition. \nMultiVersus has had a few smaller closed alpha tests but will be moving into another testing phase starting on May 19. If you're interested in a chance to throw hands with the iconic slate of Warner Bros. characters, you can sign up for a chance to play in the 9-day event on the game's website. MultiVersus does not have a release date yet but targets PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as a free-to-play product with cross-play and cross-progression.",

As for why, Bethesda kept it simple: both teams need more time to make the games the best they can be. And while my initial reaction was sadness – like many, I was very excited to check out both this year – I feel a bit of relief.\nNo, I’m not going to mention that Shigeru Miyamoto quote here, as I’m sure you’ve heard it plenty of times (it’s true, though!), but I will say that this delay means a lot for Bethesda. In fact, I think Bethesda’s Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success. \n\n\nLet’s head back to 2011.

When the series hit a low point, Yoshida helped turn its tide, most notably helping transform Final Fantasy XIV after its disastrous launch into one of the most successful and revered MMORPGs of this generation. Nearly a decade later, he’s still finding ways to keep fans engaged with the content and returning for top-tier expansions like Endwalker. This consistency hasn’t gone unnoticed.

Some of the Motive team revealed this in a new livestream that aired today. Back in March, the team showcased some new gameplay in a livestream focused on the remake’s audio development and today’s stream was all about the visuals of Dead Space. Right at the end of this stream, the team shared the official January release date alongside new gameplay. \nYou can check out the gameplay segment in the livestream below at the 1:18:23 mark: \n\n\nHere are some screenshots we captured from the stream if you can't yet watch the video: \n\nAccording to Motive, this gameplay is technically pre-alpha but the team said the game’s visual and environmental team worked hard to elevate this to a state they’d consider greater than pre-alpha. In fact, Motive said this is closer to the level of quality that the studio says players should expect for the entire game. \n“[It’s] not ready to ship, but it’s getting closer,” one of them remarked during the segment before another revealed the team recently completed its first full walkthrough of the remake. \nAs for when we’ll see Dead Space again, Motive said it anticipates doing a gameplay-focused reveal or livestream in October, closer to Halloween. That’s perfect timing because it’s just a few months before its January 27, 2023 release date. While waiting for this gameplay reveal, be sure to check out the gameplay look shown back in March. \nDo you like how this Dead Space Remake is shaping up? Let us know in the comments below!",

There's also an update on the Alan Wake TV show first announced in 2018 (we can’t believe it’s still happening, either). As far as the new concept art goes, it’s exactly what you’d expect: moody, dark, and subtle in terms of what it reveals about Alan Wake 2. The art looks great, though! You can check it out in the slideshow below:\nMoving on to what the team has to say about Alan Wake 2, here’s what Remedy's creative director Sam Lake shared:\nYou can check out the development update for yourself below: \n\n\nElsewhere in the video, Remedy reveals that Alan Wake Remastered, which hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC last year, is coming to Switch this fall. It will be a digital-only release on Switch, and it runs natively on the console – it’s not a cloud version like Remedy’s Control is on the platform. \nRemedy also revealed that its Alan Wake TV adaptation, which was announced four years ago, is still a real thing and very much happening. In fact, the studio has found a home for the series: AMC. You likely know of AMC as the home of The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul, and now, AMC Networks has purchased the rights to this Alan Wake adaptation. Remedy says there’s still a lot to go for the series to become a reality, though, so don’t expect to watch an episode of it anytime soon. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Remedy’s Alan Wake series, read Game Informer’s Alan Wake Remastered review and then check out the reveal of Alan Wake 2. \nWhat do you think of this Alan Wake 2 concept art revealed today?

Don't despair, as this is the perfect time to brush up on your backlog and catch up before some of the industry's biggest sequels come to your favorite home console. In that spirit, we're headed back to 2018's God of War on this edition of GI Live to get reacquainted with Kratos and Atreus ahead of Ragnarok's 2022 release date (fingers crossed).\nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin your hosts, Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik, as they return to the Norse world of gods and monsters live on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT. We'll be playing the first two hours of the game, letting you know why it's one of our favorites of the last few years, and discussing where we think the next game is going (spoilers: Norse mythology is wild).\nIf you need a reminder of God of War's greatness, be sure to check out our review, where we said:\nYears ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos' reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series' evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.\n\n\nFor more on God of War: Ragnarok, keep it locked to Game Informer for up-to-the-minute updates on one of 2022's most anticipated games.",

          "description": "Netflix released the first official teaser for its upcoming Resident Evil series, which hits the subscription service on July 14, and in it, Umbrella is hiding something. Fortunately, we know exactly what it is: there’s a hidden Easter egg that leads to a second, more gruesome zombie-filled trailer within the initial one. \nThe first teaser, released publicly by Netflix, is pretty by-the-books. It tees up the show’s premise and showcases the main protagonists beginning a new life in New Raccoon City in 2022. Then it quickly transitions to 2036, at which point, much of the world seems overrun with zombies. There are a few of the video game’s most famous zombies to be found in the first teaser, but the second teaser is sure to give fans more of what they’re looking for: terror, zombie dogs, lickers, and more. \nCheck out the first teaser below, and then we’ll show you how to get to the second teaser: \n\n\nYou might have caught it yourself, but just in case you didn’t, at the 24-second mark in the first teaser, a URL appears on-screen: umbrellaisjoy.com.\nIf you head there, it takes you to a mock-up of what an Umbrella pharmaceutical website might look like. However, after a few seconds, it transitions into a Netflix Resident Evil site, at which point you should see the second teaser embedded. \nThis second teaser, in our opinion, is significantly better than the first, at least in terms of bringing the scares and horror we want out of anything related to Resident Evil.

Then, earlier this week, EA confirmed in its financial results that it was expecting to release a new Need For Speed this year while also revealing that it has four unknown games set to release between January 2023 and March 2023. Now, we have an update regarding the future of the franchise. \nWe can confirm Criterion Games and the development team at Codemasters Cheshire are officially coming together to create the future of @NeedforSpeed, forming one Criterion studio with two location hubs.

It wouldn’t be surprising if this new studio team-up were doing just that, but as it stands in these tweets, it seems the merged studio is looking ahead to the future of the Need For Speed franchise. \nPersonally, I hope that future includes a return to the Underground series or maybe even just a remaster of the first Underground – whatever it takes to listen to Lil Jon’s \"Get Low\" again while driving around a neon-lit, nighttime city, to be honest. \nWhat do you hope to see in the future for Need For Speed?

Inspired by Optimus Prime's G1 cartoon roots, this set consists of 1,508 pieces and retails for $169.99. The level of detail in Optimus' robot form is spot on, but more impressive yet, the 19 points of articulation allow for this build to transform into vehicle form, without having to disassemble it.\nIn a flash of red and blue LEGO Optimus Prime emerges from the bricks to save the world from the Decepticons! https://t.co/vyK9TzQt7N pic.twitter.com/UtsUTVYH17\nMay 12, 2022\nOptimus' chest can open up to store the Matrix of Leadership. He also comes equipped with accessories that you build, like his blaster, an energon cube, and an energy axe that you can swap with his hand. The set will be on store shelves on June 1. No word was given if this will just be a one-off with the Transformers license, or if more robots in disguise will be on the way. Take a look at the gallery below to see just how impressive this build is.",

It's always had a hand in pachinko machines and mobile releases. It also had a heavy hand in standard video game releases with franchises such as Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania, etc. Konami isn’t too concerned with the latter these days. However, it is releasing the highly-anticipated TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection this year, and its focus has continued to shift into pachinko and mobile releases. That move has paid off because mobile games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, which is also available on consoles and PC, have helped Konami establish one of its most successful years of all time, as reported by Eurogamer. \nHere’s what Konami has to say about Master…",

Now, players will have to wait roughly a year to play both.\nBoth will launch on Xbox Game Pass now that Bethesda is owned by Microsoft. It's unclear when we'll get our first deep-dive looks at both of these games but considering Bethesda said \"soon\" in its update today, there's a good chance they'll show up at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase happening on June 12. \nWhich game are you more excited to see?

This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. \n\nAs you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. \nFirst off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. \nIn the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that. \n[Source: Kotaku]\nWhich pair of Chucks are your favorite amongst this lineup?
