          "description": "\"Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living\".\nKiki’s Delivery Service is a movie all about growing up. The night Kiki leaves home to complete a year of witch training, she excitedly overstuffs her bag, makes herself a broomstick that’s too small for her, and crashes into a couple of trees during her flight. She doesn’t have a speciality or skill, and upon arriving in the town of Koriko, she causes a ruckus by stopping traffic. Yet this all serves to set up Kiki’s growth, and the pain of becoming an adolescent and – eventually – an adult. She finds her place in the world, living above a bakery, delivering goods on her broomstick, and overcomes her fears to become the best version of herself.\nKiki is the heart of Studio Ghibli’s 1989 coming-of-age story, and it’s her brashness, positivity, and determination that has clearly rubbed off on Mika, the star of Chibig’s latest game, Mika and the Witch’s Mountain. There’s no greater influence here than the aforementioned movie; the premise of playing a witch delivery game with cel-shaded visuals and sprawling seas inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was enough to smash through its Kickstarter goal. Yet, two years after the potion was brewed, we’re left with a game that has flashes of the heart of the Studio Ghibli classic, but is sadly completely forgettable in almost every single respect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t.

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's \"curse\" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered - announced that they had received a cease and desist from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be \"smaller and more customised\", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.\n Read more",

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature.

          "description": "The next advance in video game graphics technology is not ray-tracing or tray-racing or any variation thereof - it's janky stop motion and rubbish plastic dolls, and it actually began about 30 years ago, when I watched the Adam and Joe show for the first time. If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these \"Toymovies\" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as \"of their time\". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game. \n Read more",

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.\nRead more",

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it \"a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.\" \nRead more",

          "description": "You're a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.\nRead more",

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals?

Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.\nRead more",

The game festering beneath is actually a \"plant horror\" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable \"Instinct\" abilities and one-hit deaths.\nIn a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it \"Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls\", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those \"painterly\" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as \"rotted\" and \"unhallowed\" and \"manky\". It's out on 6th September.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

If you are not surprised by the things they do, you can easily control the fight. It is worth highlighting here one of the largest differences between early Black Myth: Wukong gameplay and other similar games. If you over-commit, you are dead. Definitely don't spam the dodge button, and don't spam heavy attacks.

Not only should you ring this bell, but there are two other bells that you should ring. Doing so will whisk you away to a secret location, where you can find a very useful item indeed.\n\n\nI have a full guide on each bell location, but I shall also give you some brief info here, as it would be rude not to. You can stay playing through the game until you reach the following two bosses, each of which will have a bell nearby.\n\n\n\nGuangmou - this fight comes just after the Snake Trail area in Bamboo Groove. When the fight is over, make your way up the stone steps to the next bell.\n\n\nWhiteclad Noble - this fight is in Marsh of White Mist, once again in the Bamboo Groove area. When the Noble is down, head left into the cave, not through the ruined building. Take out the enemies there and ring the bell.\n\n\n\nThis will whisk you away to the secret Ancient Guanyin Temple, where you will need to fight and beat the Elder  Jinchi. This fight is a variant of the Wandering Wight fight, with one major difference. From time to time, the Elder Jinchi will float in the area, drawing in the thralls below to heal himself.\n\n\nFocus on taking out the thralls and eventually, he will drop to the ground, and you can get to work on him again. When he is down, you will get the Fireproof Mantle, which will be very useful later in the game.\n\nThe post Should you ring the bell after fighting Guangzhi in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're the type of Madden NFL 25 player who likes options, the Run-Pass Option (RPO) could be right up your alley.\n\n\nThis play call is a bit different from a static, defined run or pass option. Rather than commit to a single play, you head to the line of scrimmage with the option for both, depending on how the defense reacts. As attractive as it sounds, mastering this particular play can be difficult. First, let's take a look at the controls.\n\n\nHow to perform the Run-Pass Option (RPO) in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nA key to this play is to quickly decide between two post-snap options - run the ball, or pass it to one of your receivers. The controls will vary accordingly.\n\n\n\nPress A/X to perform the snap.\n\n\nIf you want the RB to run with the ball, don't press any button. Your RB will automatically grab the ball post-snap and run with it.\n\n\nIf you want the ball to be passed, press your receiver's button post-snap. This will perform a pass. Make sure to do this before the RB receives the ball. \n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nAs I said, mastering an RPO isn't very easy. There are several aspects of pulling off the play successfully. A significant advantage offered by the RPO is the fact that you're not locked to any particular play. You need to observe the opposition's defense and choose whether you want to go with the run or pass option.\n\n\nIf you see that your receivers are being guarded tightly, it's better to run with the ball. Chances are that the defense, which is focusing on the wide receivers, could leave spaces for runs. Similarly, it's better to pass if your running channels appear blocked, due to congestion in the middle.\n\n\nThe RPO is an effective, flexible option if you're looking to keep the defense on their toes. Make sure to put some reps in on this, and try it out in your next match.\n\nThe post How to use the Run-Pass Option (RPO) in Madden 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Destiny 2 Solstice of Heroes event has been in full swing for some time now, offering a ton of new weapons and armor from its Bonfire Bash activity and other tasks. Among those new activities include bounties to claim and complete, tasking you with farming Silver Leaves.\n\n\nIt's a bit tedious, but not a difficult chore. To that end, here is the best way to farm Silver Leaves in Destiny 2. \n\n\nWhere to farm Silver Leaves in Destiny 2\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe best place to farm Silver Leaves in Destiny 2 is, oddly enough, public events. These are the little events that show up across certain open-world zones, as shown above. Simply head to the designated location and complete the public event with other players, and within just a few minutes, you'll earn Silver Leaves. You'll receive more if you make the public event heroic, but will inevitably take a bit longer.\n\n\nIf you get tired of running those, the next best method is running numerous strikes through the Vanguard Ops playlist. These last five to 10 minutes a piece and reward five Silver Leaves when completing them. It's not the most efficient, but it's a lot less tedious than running public event after public event. It may help if you weave these into each other, too.\n\n\nThere is, technically, one easier way than either of these methods, but it's rather boring and requires you to semi-AFK. To do it, set up a private match of Control in Crucible and set the required score to 25. Then, simply go capture a point and wait for the game to end. Once it does, you'll get some Silver Leaves without having to work for it. Again, it's pretty boring, but if you want to AFK it, then this is your best bet.\n\nThe post Best way to farm Silver Leaves in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Dr. Doom the focal point of the current Fortnite season, players will have to confront one of the better-known antagonists from Marvel Comics. However, those with a keen eye who play fighting games may notice that Doom has an attack hearkening back to his Marvel vs. Capcom (MvC) days.\n\n\nPlayers partaking in the new Absolute Doom season are feeling the wrath of the very notorious \"foot dive\" move he performs in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. On Twitter, user CaptainGalxy highlighted Dr. Doom's signature hit as it appears in Fortnite — and it looks like plenty of folks have nostalgia for it. \n\n\n\n\nIt seems like Victor von Doom leaps into the air, charges up with a glowing green aura, and announces his attack with an insult-to-injury \"you're beneath me\" quip. Take the hit or move out of the way, as it won't kill you, but it will disorient you from its pushback. This has to be an intentional nod to the Marvel vs. Capcom fighting game franchise.\n\n\nWith the resurgence of the Marvel fighting games, namely the first two, this obvious nod to the franchise is just what we need to keep the momentum going. What better way is there to build hype than to possibly reenact the iconic moments between characters who appear in these older titles and who are now in Fortnite?  \n\n\nAs someone who puts dozens of hours a month into fighting games, this crossover, especially with its detailed fan-service additions, make the new season of Fortnite that much more enticing to hop back into. This really is the “New Age of Heroes” in a different coat of paint. Hopefully, some of these collaborations bring those who aren’t even into Fortnite out, at least to see how far it has evolved since the “OG” days.\n\nThe post Fortnite’s Dr. Doom gets his MvC foot dive in the latest season appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Among Us-themed Raid Boss is Level 1550 and worth defeating. Here is how to get the Sussy Orb in Meme Sea and the best way to farm it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to farm the Sussy Orb in Meme Sea\n\n\nThe Sussy Orb in Meme Sea can be obtained as a rare drop from Red Sus enemies and the Sus Duck, two enemies found on Sus Island. The Sussy Orb has a 5% chance to drop each time you kill a Red Sus or Sus Duck enemy.\n\n\nIf you're looking for the absolute best way to farm the Sussy Orb, you'll want to head to either the part of Sus Island where lots of Red Sus spawn, or the center square of the town where five Sus Ducks spawn throughout the square. Next, use Floppap Power to AoE all of the enemies at once to kill them. Because there is only a 5% drop for the Sussy Orb, you may need to repeat this for several cycles of spawns because it will typically take 20 kills or so for the Sussy Orb to drop based on its drop chance.\n\n\nIn the town square, five Sus Ducks spawn each time, so you should get the Sussy Orb in about four spawn cycles or so.\n\n\nHow to use the Sussy Orb in Meme Sea\n\n\nOnce you've acquired a Sussy Orb from either the Red Sus or Sus Ducks on Sus Island, you'll then want to head to Forgotten Island. Here you will find the Sus Altar, which is where you use the Sussy Orb. Doing so will spawn the Lord Sus raid boss which is Level 1550 and has 460,000 Health. The Lord Sus has two attacks: a close-range basic attack and Giant Blade, where Lord Sus attacks the player with a falling Giant Sword. He will use Giant Sword every 10 seconds.\n\n\nDefeating Lord Sus can yield you two possible rare drops: Sus Pals, which is an Among Us-themed accessory with a 10% drop chance, and the Purple Katana weapon that has a 5% drop chance. Both of these are worth farming, so you may need many Sussy Orbs to get both rewards.\n\nThe post How to get Sussy Orb in Meme Sea appeared first on Destructoid.",
