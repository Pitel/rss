          "description": "Stepping back in time.\nMaking any video game is exceptionally hard work. But creating a retro-style experience that feels 100% authentic to the source inspiration adds a whole extra layer of difficulty. Implementing pixel art visuals and calling it a day just doesn't cut it, but what developer JoyMasher has done with Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is truly remarkable. Much like its previous effort with Blazing Chrome, the team has successfully created a 2D action title that looks, sounds, and plays like it came straight from the early ‘90s, down to the exceptional environmental detail and enemy design.\nInspired by the likes of Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master and Strider, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is a sci-fi action platformer in which you take on the role of the titular Moonrider, a cybernetic ninja who rejects its intended purpose as a tool to preserve a totalitarian state and instead wages war against its creators. After making your way through the opening level (we recommend playing through the excellent tutorial section, too), you’ll have a choice of six additional stages to tackle in whichever order you see fit, followed by two final stages to round out the experience. Each stage houses its own boss character and beating each of these will grant you a new ability. Very similar to Mega Man in many ways, then.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It's dangerous to go 'lone.\nThough it flew under a lot of radars, Cuddle Monster Games’ Hell is Other Demons was a standout platform shooter of 2019, featuring razor-sharp, ultra-tough action gameplay alongside a delicious neon aesthetic. Considering it was mostly the work of just one man by the name of Hannes Rahm, Hell is Other Demons was an impressive achievement and a great example of a niche classic. Rahm's latest project is Lone Ruin, which feels in a lot of ways like a spiritual successor to that initial release. That same dark atmosphere and intense gameplay are present, but now things play out in 3D. Though Lone Ruin doesn’t feel like it quite meets the bar its predecessor set, it still manages to be a raucously good time while it lasts.\nLone Ruin is all about the gameplay, which is equal parts thrilling and simple. A typical run involves you entering a room, clearing out all waves of enemies, collecting the reward (if you survive), then moving on to the next room. Most enemies go down after just a few shots, but the tricky part comes in with how easily you can get swarmed by them. Some enemies can shoot lasers and projectiles while others may explode on contact, and when things really heat up, there’s scarcely a square inch of space to be found onscreen where your character won’t be hurt. Luckily, your character is pretty light on their feet, and they also have a dash move on a small cooldown that can grant a few i-frames of respite while you reposition.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Oh Mr. Sandman...\nWe are just over a month away from the release of Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and the team over at HAL Laboratory has started drip-feeding us new additions to the game. The most prominent of these is the reveal of Kirby's new Copy Abilities - power-ups gained after inhaling an enemy. We already knew of the Mecha ability from the first trailer, but it looks like a whole lot more is on the way.\nShared via @NintendoUK, the game will introduce a new 'Sand' Copy Ability for the pink puffball. This power-up will allow Kirby the chance to manipulate the environment into protective shelter, or blast enemies with granular attacks. Slashing at your opponents with a sword or scorching them with fire is one thing, but putting some sand in their eye? That's truly evil.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. \n\"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry,\" he tells me. \"We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention.\" \nRead more",

That suit alleged that CDPR had \"made materially false or misleading statements\" regarding the game, particularly as related to the condition of its console release, and sought damages.\r\n\nNow a proposed settlement has been approved by a federal judge in California's Central District. The settlement reached will see CDPR pay out $1.85 million USD (around £1.52m GBP), or roughly $0.49 per eligible share.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG.

That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a \"blockage of the flow of love\".

I put my bread in the toaster one slice at a time. \r\n\n\r\nAnyway, with that out the way, here’s a list of things I liked this year that no one else at RPS had a chance to play, or in one case just thought was total ass.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "These honourable mentions lists are a lovely little wrap up of games we couldn't squeeze into the 2022 Advent Calendar, and mine is also a useful reminder that I didn't just spend the entire year playing Elden Ring. Lots of time was spent as a lowly tarnished, getting smacked around by big fucken madlads with a dragon for an arm, sure. But I also got lost in a thrilling narrative adventure, laughed at flatulent renditions of our national anthem, swept up loot in Al Mazrah, and became enamoured with a lil gator. Here's to 2022, everyone.\nRead more",

We're each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he's away, we've prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.\nTime to enjoy your lovely joke!\nQ.

One would assume that this also applies to online modes of Shredder's Revenge, so hopefully you have three pals all subbed to the streaming service if you want some handheld multiplayer action.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcaEQVBcY0&ab_channel=Netflix\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge sees the fab four team with Channel 9 reporter April O'Neil, sensei Master Splinter, and sporting goods vigilante Casey Jones on a mission to stop The Shredder and his Foot Clan from taking over The Big Apple. The game features a huge variety of cameos and references to Eastman and Laird's iconic 1987 TV series — including appearances from Bebop & Rocksteady, The Rat King, Irma, Vernon, and the Teenagers from Dimension X.\nThe mobile port is not currently in parity with the PC and console releases, sitting just one update behind. So while not all of the game's bugs and issues have been ironed out for the mobile port, the majority of features and modes are all present and ready to rock. For our thoughts on the original release, check out our full review right here.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.\nThe post TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge hits mobile as a Netflix subscriber exclusive appeared first on Destructoid.",

That changes today, as we have new copy ability reveals: the best kind of Kirby reveals.\nThe announcement come by way of two tweets, both of which are from the Nintendo UK account. The first one confirms \"Sand,\" a new copy ability coming to Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, which allows Kirby to \"shift sand into a variety of shapes, from a fist to a castle, and take on even the toughest foes.\" So like the Spider-Man villain Sandman? That sounds rad. The other is actually a returning copy ability that hails from Kirby Star Allies. It's none other than \"Festival,\" which is a dancing-based ability that's kind of like an ultimate (think screen-freezing mass damage).\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1613102374154866688\nI'm ready to return to Dream Land\nIt's crazy to think that 11 years later this game is making a grand return, but I couldn't be happier. Return to Dream Land Deluxe deserves a bigger spotlight, and it'll get it on the Switch: which has its massive (and growing) install base. Also, to be frank, it'll be easier to replay it on the Switch (though I still have my Wii U [which I use!] hooked up out of respect [and to play old Wii games!]).\nThe post Nintendo shares new/returning copy abilities coming to Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Revengeance\nThe retro-inspired market went from novel to heavily saturated rather quickly, and now they’ve been their own corner of the industry for over a decade. It’s a rather difficult corner to stand out in. It’s a pretty busy corner.\nFor my money, it’s a precarious balancing act between building off designs and mechanics of the era, while also finding a memorable identity. You can make Contra again, and if you do a good job, that can be good enough. But you can’t stand with the big boys unless you bring your own pants. Or something. I sometimes just hork up analogies and hope they make sense.\nWith Oniken, Odallus, and Blazing Chrome under their belt, JoyMasher has tried on a few pairs of pants in their years. Really, though, those games harken rather heavily toward their influences.  …",

          "description": "'I guess we really are The Last of Us Part I'\nFollowing a frankly obnoxious amount of media build-up and endless think-pieces, HBO finally previewed its live-action adaptation of The Last of Us to an army of critics, who have been overwhelmingly positive in their response to the grim-looking televisual take of the hit game series.\nThe new series currently sits at an incredible 97% on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, with a score calculated from a total of 60 media reviews. The long-in-development series, which will debut on the HBO network next week, sees beleaguered protagonists Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) pick their way through a dilapidated shell of the United States, attempting to stay one step ahead of thieving marauders and the terrifying mutated humans known as \"Clickers.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax\nThe HBO TV adaptation was first announced back in 2020, a seemingly snug fit for a game series so beholden to its distinct cinematic style. The show is produced by a litany of companies including Sony Pictures, Word Games, Naughty Dog, and the recently founded PlayStation Productions. The show itself is written by Craig Mazin, the Emmy award-winning creator of equally grim series Chernobyl, and Neil Druckmann, the writer of the video game iterations of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.\nIf you're looking forward to the new show, then you won't have too much longer to wait. The first episode will air this Sunday, January 15, on HBO and HBO Max. In the UK, The Last of Us will air at 02:00 BST on Monday mornings via Sky Atlantic and NOW TV, to coincide with the U.S. timeslot. Don't fret staying up, as each episode will be made available on demand after its respective premiere.\nWe're about to hit a whole new wave of Last of Us discourse, folks. Batten down the fuckin' hatches.\nThe post The Last of Us TV adaptation receives overwhelming praise from critics appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Never doubt the power of the Steam Sale\nValve has announced that its popular PC retail platform, Steam, smashed a major record this past weekend, surpassing 10 million concurrent in-game players for the first time in the platform's near 20-year history.\nThe mighty number was achieved on Saturday, January 7, with a peak high of 10,082,055 Steam users in-game. That's not sitting idle, or just logged in, but actively playing in one of the hundreds of thousands of titles in the Steam library. On Sunday, January 8, this figure was further surpassed, with a peak player count of 10,284,568. In addition to breaking the active player record, Steam also beat out its current record for overall concurrent users, with a weekend high of 33,078,963.\nThat's a lot of people grinding for trading cards.\nSteam typically hits high figures during the winter period, mostly due to the advent of its annual, wallet-munching Steam sale. This period is then followed by a plethora of users playing their new games, spending holiday gift vouchers, or simply chilling during their time away from work, school, or college. This latest winter, in addition, will have seen many in possession of a shiny new Steam Deck remaining logged in and/or playing while on the go, which no doubt also helped pushed these numbers into new frontiers.\nhttps://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1611821827948531714?s=20&t=x6RpCjY_JJPgNrIdY4PF_w\nThe post Steam hit 10 million concurrent in-game players for the first time ever appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the title was sadly left out of the conversation for a lot of awards at the end of last year, it's grown a steady cult following with fans — I can see it being one of those games that's only appreciated more and more as time goes on. We're off to a good start though, because pre-orders are now up for physical editions of Signalis for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.\nThe physical edition will run players $29.99 (Signalis pre-orders are currently listed online at Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target in the US), but Humble Games is sweetening the deal by adding in an extra bonus item for players to enjoy: a holographic replica polaroid, which is a key item in the actual game. I'd love to see Signalis get some fancy special edition releases in the future (maybe for an anniversary down the line or something), but for now this physical edition should make for a great collector's piece.\nhttps://twitter.com/LastStarfarer/status/1611439084328583168\nHere at Destructoid we're huge fans of Signalis — Eric Van Allen gave it a 9.5/10 score in his review, and I even chronicled my own experience playing the game, and how it's helped me confront my fear of horror games.

Battles take place in turn-based squad formation, letting players build their own team to tackle enemies.\nPlenty of beloved characters look set to return, too. The obvious suspects, like Aang, Zuko, Toph, Katara, and Sokka, are all here. But so are Suki, Gyatso, Princess Yue, and others from through The Last Airbender.

In an email obtained by UploadVR, Meta explained how the changes will affect Quest 1 users from spring forward.\nQuest 1 user will still be able to use all of the currently available apps and hardware, but no new features will be included in Quest 1 updates and the compatibility of apps moving forward is not guaranteed. Additionally, as of March, Quest 1 users will no longer be able to create or join parties, and will lose all access to the Meta Horizon Home features. So no more visiting your virtual pals or inviting them over to your virtual abode.\nMeta notes that it will continue to roll out critical bug fixes and security patches until 2024.\nReleased in 2019 as the successor to Oculus GO, Quest launched in the spring of 2019 at a retail price of $400.

          "description": "Face your Fears\nWe are just two weeks out from the launch of Square Enix' fantasy adventure Forspoken, and the publisher is ramping up its marketing drive with an evocative new cinematic trailer, spotlighting our hero, Frey, and the challenges that she faces in both this world and the next.\nIn the short cinematic, we see Frey on the run in two distinctly different scenarios, one in the avenues and alleyways of New York City, and then in the jungles and desert plains of the mysterious nation of Athia. Regardless of the terrain, the threat, and the motivation, Frey's goal remains the same: Survival. And, ultimately, when her back is against the wall, she will have no option but face her pursuers, and turn the hunters into the hunted.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6goMdDb4UQ&ab_channel=SquareEnix\nForspoken is an open-world fantasy adventure developed by Luminous Productions. While its protagonist is intriguing, its world lush and vibrant, and its visual effects sharp and dazzling, the incoming release is struggling to light the hype fires as its publisher might have hoped. It has, admittedly, become incredibly trendy to rag on this game, but I'm personally willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt, for now.\nStill, optimism will only carry a title so far, and the truth will out soon enough when Forspoken finally makes it into the hands of the players.\nForspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC.

The Kyo Kusanagi fanboy will be followed in the spring by veteran Fatal Fury star and bringer of JUSTICE Kim Kaphwan. Around this time, SNK also hopes to launch a beta for its crossplay servers, which are expected to officially open at some point later this summer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv9bxAVRCQ&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nAnd speaking of the season, those warm winter months will see the return of KoF XIV debutantes Najd and Sylvie Paula Paula. Najd, as you might remember, was the winning entry in a \"Design a Character\" competition held by SNK back in 2018. As such, to see the mysterious vigilante make their return pays tribute to their designer, artist Mashael Al-Barrak. The absolute MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula is an incredibly loud, boisterous, and colorful NESTS operative, whose obnoxiously cutesy ways and dopey visage belies a dangerous killer instinct and literally electrifying fighting skills.\nHonestly?

The update first released on PC back in 2020, and mobile players have been asking when they'll get a chance to check it out ever since. Eric Barone, the solo developer behind the title, tweeted out on January 6th that the 1.5 update had been submitted for review on iOS and Android platforms. The update had some issues in its first few days as players reported various bugs, but Barone has already rolled out at least one patch to fix the most glaring problems.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1611612814271184899\nIt's easy to miss, but in the thread of replies following that initial tweet, Barone said that the re-write of the game's app that was required to make the 1.5 update work should make things \"easier to update mobile in the future (for 1.6 and who knows...).\" We have no idea what the 1.6 update would entail — it could simply be more basic bug fixes, although the fans (myself included) would be happy to guess that it's another content update, or maybe even multiplayer.\nEither way, it's great to see Barone still has plenty of love to give to his debut title, even as he's working on another upcoming release, Haunted Chocolatier.\nThe post Stardew Valley’s 1.5 update finally lands on mobile, and 1.6 is in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "More Isaac for your buck\nIf you're keen on revisiting the Dead Space series ahead of the remake releasing this month, the Steam pre-order has a neat incentive. Pre-ordering the Dead Space remake on Steam before January 27 will net you the second game in the series, Dead Space 2, for free.\nAs spotted by VG247, the Steam pre-order has a special deal going. Picking up Dead Space through either its base version or slightly-more-expensive Digital Deluxe version will net you a free copy of Dead Space 2. And if you've already pre-purchased the remake, you should receive a copy of Dead Space 2.\nWhile it might feel a bit disorienting to get the sequel to the original as a tie-in for the original's remake, this does net you two absolutely stellar sci-fi survival horror gems. The Dead Space series has garnered acclaim over the years, and for good reason. The first two are prime examples of action-oriented sci-fi horror. The third game? Well, that's a different story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTDJNZ9cK1w\nSpace-based savings\nIt's a nice upside for those who want to dip back into the series ahead of the remake, or maybe have the second lined up to play after they finish the remake. That date isn't too far off, either. EA Motive's Dead Space is set to launch on January 27, 2023 for PC, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\nWhile a remake of one of sci-fi's survival classics is already a strong pitch, survival horror fans are also probably hungry for Dead Space's return. The Callisto Protocol stumbled out of the gate at the end of 2022. And now, a remake of a major inspiration is just around the corner. It could be a big one for survival horror fans. We'll see how Isaac and the crew fare on new tech in just a few weeks.\nThe post Dead Space remake pre-orders on Steam come with Dead Space 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Anyone down for a 2D puzzle platformer?\nYouTube personality videogamedunkey has made a name for himself on the internet with his game reviews/critiques and signature comedic style. Last year, Dunkey announced that he was going to be founding his very own games publishing studio known as Bigmode, and the news was met with mixed emotions.\nIt's been a little over four months since Dunkey's initial announcement, and now he has officially unveiled his first publishing partnership -- Bigmode will publish a game called Animal Well, a Metroidvania-inspired 2D puzzle platformer. Dunkey disclosed his deal with the game's developer, Billy Basso, in his newest YouTube video \"Dunkey's Best of 2022.\" He says that the game is \"one of the few at E3 [2022] that caught [his] eye,\" and that \"it's a game coming from a very pure place of love for video games.\" That sentiment was one of the main reasons Dunkey cited for wanting to start a company like this in the first place, so I'm glad he's found a title to support that aligns with his values in that way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21T-Sc-TXJY\nIf you missed the conversation surrounding Dunkey's initial announcement of Bigmode, here's the gist: some fans were annoyed that in his announcement video, Dunkey implied that he was partially responsible for the success of games like Cuphead, Undertale, and Celeste because he promoted them on his channel. Regardless, Dunkey clearly has a strong vision of the kind of games he wants publish, and while he lacks experience on the development side of the games industry, I'm looking forward to seeing if he can carve his own path in a different part of the industry.\n[Featured Image via Shared Memory]\nThe post Bigmode, videogamedunkey’s indie publishing company, announces their debut title appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.</p>\n\n<p>With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/16/the-dawn-of-a-new-era\">Read more...</a></p>",

Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.</p>\n\n<p>It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/12/16/new-blood\">Read more...</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
