          "description": "Come at the king, you best not miss.\nIt’s safe to say that, 146 million sales later, Nintendo’s risk of launching a dockable handheld console in 2017 has paid off handsomely. After all, Sony’s PS Vita was all but dead by that point, and despite the 3DS managing to reverse its fortunes after a swift price drop in its first year, many claimed that the rise of mobile gaming would spell the end of handheld consoles.\nYet the Switch proved the naysayers wrong and, if anything, ignited a renewed interest in handhelds the likes of which we haven’t seen in years. Mobile gaming has fallen by the wayside (somewhat - though Nintendo properties have also dipped their toes in the water here), and, we now have a bevvy of powerful handheld consoles to choose from, including the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally X, the Lenovo Legion Go, and many more. Yet despite the growing competition, the Switch has comfortably maintained its position as the king of handheld gaming in 2024.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now, this is yet to be confirmed by the developer and there's obviously no guarantee that the Switch version will arrive on the same day, but this certainly seems like a real possibility.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now it’s time for the third proper entry in the series, and thankfully regular Fitness Boxing players will find some new stuff in here to freshen up their daily routine. There are new modes, new tasks, and even a new way to explore the Fitness Boxing lore. Yes, it turns out there’s lore now, apparently.\nThe main workout mode returns and brings with it the same strengths and weaknesses it always did. Those who played the previous games will know exactly what to expect here: after picking your workout of choice (or accepting the Daily Workout chosen for you based on your required time, intensity, and target body areas), you repeat a series of punching and dodging motions to the beat, almost like a violent rhythm game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But, since 2004, Sakaguchi has been at the helm at Mistwalker, his development studio which has a knack for slightly twisting the traditional turn-based RPG affair. Over the years, we’ve seen that in Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian, the studio’s latest game, fits that mould, but it also feels slightly different. Sakaguchi admits that he was inspired to make Fantasian after replaying Final Fantasy VI on stream, reminding him how much he loved the genre. We’ve waited over three years since the two-part Apple Arcade release, but now console gamers can experience Sakaguchi’s ambitious project with FANTASIAN Neo Dimension, a game with flashes of brilliance – including a beautiful world and rewarding combat – held back by uneven pacing, brutally long encounters, and a lacklustre story.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We’ll have that!\" is how I imagine detective immersive sim Shadows Of Doubt made it on the roster for the Jingle Jam 2024 charity bundle. \"RPS have never steered us wrong before!\" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.\n19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

It's boring because it's a \"solved game\" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the \"perfect\" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. \nHow many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe?

But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.\nJames already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me.

It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.\nRead more",

Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: \"STOP talking SH1T about us\". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as \"anticitizens\".\nRead more",

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.\nIt’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying \"we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own\". \"You’re right!\" you respond. \"I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie\". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.\n\"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?\" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew.

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.\nObviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.\nRead more",

These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.\n Read more",

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.\nRead more",

This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced \"Trese\") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.\nI'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.\nRead more",

Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.\nRead more",

But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones.

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. \nRead more",

          "description": "Announced last year, Exo Rally Championship does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of Exo One's interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.\r\n\nNow there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three \"ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.\n$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.\nRead more",

The orthodox interpretation is that \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a \"shotgun\" instead of the \"scissors\". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!\nThe sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials.

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger.

The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. \"For who is madder?!\" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. \"The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!\"\nAnd if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?\nRead more",

Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.\nRead more",

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

If that turns out to be true, Ultimate Succession will become the first promo this year to feature all three cards - active footballers, Heroes, and Icons.\n\n\nAs always, some of the names that will be revealed as leaks could appear as SBCs and objectives. Lately, EA Sports has dropped some expensive SBCs as part of the Thunderstruck promo, and the community will hope for a few reasonably priced ones.\n\n\nOnce we have more leaks, they will be added to the list mentioned here.

You'll also get Chip Shot+, Finesse Shot, Power Shot, and Long Ball, and Avila can play as a LM and RM. \n\n\nHe looks like a pretty useful utility option, and the relatively low overall rating means that the card might be eligible for upgrades as part of an upcoming evolution. \n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete the Chimy Avila World Tour SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

The easiest way to get access to information on everything is through their community channels. Here’s how to access the Anime Power Defense Trello.\n\n\nHow to Find the Anime Power Defense Trello\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere are all of Anime Power Defense’s community channels where you can get the latest info on the game:\n\n\n\nOfficial Anime Power Defense Trello.\n\n\nAPD Discord Server.\n\n\nCommunity Anime Power Defense Wiki.\n\n\nAPD Roblox Community.\n\n\n\nFor clear-cut and organized information on the game, I highly recommend that you check out the Trello board first. There, you can find every piece of content and mechanic in the game sorted by category. Examples include:\n\n\n\nInfo on different currencies.\n\n\nMissions.\n\n\nAll rewards.\n\n\nAll Game Modes.\n\n\nUpdates.\n\n\nAll Units are sorted by rarity.\n\n\nAll Skins.\n\n\nAll Powers.\n\n\nAll Items.\n\n\nAll Emotes.\n\n\nInformation on all lobby stations.\n\n\nUnit tier lists.\n\n\nAny previous events.\n\n\n\nThe APD Wiki holds the same type of content but goes in-depth to explain each unit or game mode instead of just listing them. Both are run by the community, so you can expect regular updates on everything as they’re highly active on both platforms.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re not looking for technical objective information and are looking for a more subjective approach, check out their Discord. The community gathers there to discuss strategies, best units, farming methods, and a lot more. This is also where you can ask specific questions you might have in both the General and Questions-and-Help channels.\n\n\nLastly, Discord is also where you can check out the latest updates, announcements, and patch notes. I’d recommend staying up to date on these for any giveaways that might pop up. Speaking of free stuff, codes can be found here, too.

          "description": "In this modern gaming era, we kind of just accept that new releases need a lot of tinkering post-launch, and STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is no different. \n\n\nHaving spent a decade and a half in development, the long-awaited sequel to the cult survival horror FPS series is doing pretty well so far, with a current meta score of 73. But it evidently still needs work (as most modern games do).\n\n\nWithin the past week, we've already had two patches being sent out for both the console and PC versions of STALKER 2, and now a third one has started rolling out. GSC Game World is evidently keeping a close eye on the game and player feedback, as Patch 1.0.3 comes just four days after 1.0.2.\n\n\n\n\nThis update seems to target issues with crashes and memory leaks, specifically fixing multiple \"ACCESS_VIOLATION_ERROR\" and \"LowLevelFatalError\" issues. Whatever all those words mean.\n\n\nFixes to missions as well\n\n\nAdditionally, the patch also plugs some issues with the AI, including one in which NPCs would \"block the doors during the Back to the Slag Heap mission.\" Speaking of missions, there have been a few fixes in that region as well, though the patch notes have blanked some of the specifics, presumably to save from potential spoilers.\n\n\nThere was also an issue with saves, in which some people were finding their save files were missing after a hard reset of their Xbox or PC. The new update should fix this for anyone who has experienced it.\n\n\nLook, it's not for me to say whether three patches in less than a week is a good thing or not. On the one hand, it shows that GSC is evidently on the case when it comes to reacting to issues and feedback. On the other, it does go back on the developer's claim that, prior to release, STALKER 2 had gone gold, suggesting it was fit for release. In any case, one can't help but suspect Patch 1.0.4 is just around the corner, for good or ill.\n\nThe post STALKER 2 has already had its third patch – let’s see how things are going appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a four-star dish from the House of Mouse that is relatively easy to make for your pals.\n\n\nBarley Salad Disney Dreamlight  Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo gain access to the ingredients in this recipe, you'll first require The Storybook Vale DLC for Disney Dreamlight Valley. \n\n\nOnce that's purchased and installed, you can make Barley Salad in Disney Dreamlight Valley with the following ingredients:\n\n\n\nBarley\n\n\nRadish\n\n\nCauliflower\n\n\nAny Spice\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe star ingredients, Barley (its seeds) and Cauliflower seeds, can be bought from Goofy's Stall in The Bind. They're on the top shelf for 10 Star Coins and 15 Star Coins each. Once you have these planted and watered, Barley will take 15 minutes to grow, while Cauliflower only needs 10. \n\n\nRadish Seeds can be purchased from another Goofy's Stall, this time in Everafter's The Wild Woods. These ingredient seeds cost 100 Star Coins each, making them more expensive than the Barley seeds and Cauliflower seeds combined. They take a lengthy one hour and 45 minutes to grow after they're planted and watered. You should perform other tasks like helping Hades with his leadership issues in his friendship quest or catching Snippets.\n\n\nYou can pick any spice for this dish. You can get Black Pepper seed from Goofy's Stall in Mythopia for example. He sells it for 70 Star Coins. Spices from other regions like Ginger and Cinnamon also work.\n\n\nOnce you have all of the ingredients, put them all in a pot at a cooking station and you'll have the Barley Salad in your inventory. You can sell it for around 325 Star Coins, depending on the spice you choose. You can consume the meal for 1,261 Energy as well.\n\nThe post How to make Barley Salad in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The 9mm PM pistol in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is one of the first secondary weapons you'll have in your possession. Thankfully, it's a decent option, especially if you pick the right 9mm PM loadout in Black Ops 6. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest 9mm PM loadout choices for Black Ops 6\n\n\nThis pistol is a quality weapon with standard damage and rate of fire. However, it is a semi-auto as opposed to the Grekhova, which is full-auto, so it might get some getting used to. With those factors in mind, here's the 9mm PM loadout I'd recommend in Black Ops 6. \n\n\n\nMuzzle: Compensator\n\n\nBarrel: Reinforced Barrel\n\n\nMagazine: Extended Mag I\n\n\nRear Grip: Assault Grip\n\n\nFire Mod: 9x18mm Makarov FMJ\n\n\n\nThe Compensator, as the 9mm PM's muzzle, is a great choice as it improves the accuracy of the gun and the vertical recoil control of the pistol. Next, the Barrel should be the Reinforced Barrel. It improves your Bullet Velocity by 25% and increases the Damage Range of the gun.\n\n\nMore often than not, you'll run out of bullets with the 9mm PM during tense moments. When this occurs, the Extended Mag I as your Magazine is helpful. It slightly increases your Magazine Ammo Capacity despite it affecting your Reload Quickness by 8%. \n\n\nThe Rear Grip should be based entirely on your playstyle with the pistol. If you want a 9mm PM that's snappy, choose the Quickdraw Grip, as it significantly increases your Aim Down Speed. However, if you're sprinting often with this pistol, the Assault Grip would be a better option; this also works with the ASG-89. If you dive and slide often while shooting with the pistol, the Ergonomic Grip is also a good choice. \n\n\nLastly, the Fire Mod should be the 9x18mm Makarov FMJ. It increases the damage of your Scorestreaks, like the sentry turret, and your Penetration Damage. This helps make the weapon great at short-range encounters, especially against those hiding behind walls and corners. \n\nThe post Best 9mm PM loadout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",
