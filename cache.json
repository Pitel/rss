The twist is that there's no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.\r\n\nIt's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. \nThe 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD's limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we're starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts.

AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Only for you, the supporters, would I make such a journey. I won't detail how I made it back alive, but I did, and it is with gratitude that I present this episode of The Nate Files to you.

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.\nRead more",

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.\nWhile Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.\nRead more",

Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.\nEndling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.\nRead more",

As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.\nStray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.\nRead more",

When I first sampled the tower defence deckbuilding delights of ORX a couple of months ago, I'd assumed that we'd be playing as the demo's medieval castle builders throughout. Today, however, devs Johnbell have announced a brand-new faction for the game, the sand-loving Dune Reavers. Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies. Can you still call it tower defence if there aren't any towers involved? Decide for yourself by watching the new gameplay trailer below. \nRead more",

          "description": "A new report indicates Aspyr has hit some rough waters\nThe Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic could be on an indefinite delay, according to a new investigation. Bloomberg reports that Aspyr Media's KOTOR remake is on hold, after hitting some development troubles.\nThe remake was announced last year, during the PlayStation Showcase 2021. It's in development at Aspyr Media, an Austin-based studio that has built up a portfolio of ports, especially in the Star Wars franchise.\nBloomberg reports that Aspyr has fired the KOTOR remake's art director and design director this month. Following a series of meetings, sources tell Bloomberg that the project is on pause. Aspyr is reportedly looking for new contracts and development opportunities.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-RfE-ioJ8\nThis comes after a demo was reportedly finalized at the end of June, showing off a slice of the Knights of the Old Republic remake. Studio heads told staff the slice wasn't where they wanted it to be.\nBloomberg's sources point to two issues, via sources familiar with the matter. One is that the project may not have been sustainable on its current course, given the amount of time and money invested in the demo. The other is the timeline. While Aspyr may have been targeting the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg's sources, a more realistic target would be 2025.\nA galaxy far, far away\nThis news is disheartening for those hoping to see some KOTOR sooner rather than later. Saber Interactive, another studio under the Embracer umbrella, joined on the project earlier this year to assist development. Aspyr announced its intent to acquire Beamdog, which has some RPG talent in tow, in April. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake is still officially planned as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PC.\nNeither Aspyr Media nor Embracer Group immediately responded to Bloomberg.\nThe post The Star Wars KOTOR remake has reportedly been put on hold appeared first on Destructoid.",

He's a square, everything in Minecraft is a square — it just makes sense. Starting today, players can download the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC (as long as they have the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed), and then they're off on their adventures to explore Bikini Bottom like they never have before. The DLC was created in conjunction with Minecraft creators Spark Universe, and this has to be one of the biggest DLC packs I've seen for the game.\nIt comes with over forty skins, a huge map with locations all over Bikini Bottom, minigames, collectibles, and more. Of course, you'll get to visit classic locations like SpongeBob's house, the Krusty Krab, and the Chum Bucket, but the DLC even includes more obscure locations from the show like the Barg'N-Mart, Glove World, and Goo Lagoon. Whether you're frolicking through Jellyfish Fields, defending the Krusty Krab from hungry anchovies, or racing at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, you're likely to have the best day ever. Players can also get a free Character Creator item from now until September 16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9914FnO95J8\nBased on the sheer amount of content we saw in the trailer alone, this looks like one of the most substantial DLCs for Minecraft I've ever seen. The level of detail in portraying the show's famous episodes is something to behold, and you just know that the creators are really big fans themselves.\nHonestly, it looks like this DLC pack is basically a whole new game in its own right, and could keep you busy for a few dozen hours at least if you do everything. I haven't played Minecraft in a good while, but as someone who grew up with SpongeBob, this release has me thinking I might want to crack open the old account again, for nostalgia's sake.\nThe post SpongeBob SquarePants DLC makes a splash in Minecraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

The adorable Cerberus and Dusa plushes are $32 each, while the three-print Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium set is a whopping $179.]\nSupergiant's fantastic action-RPG Hades is custom designed for merchandise, thanks to its attractive visuals, cool aesthetic style, strong colors, and varied cast of memorable characters. Bafflingly, however, Hades gear has been incredibly hard to come by, with nary an art book or pair of Zubaz pants in sight.\nEnter merch-makers Fangamer, who has finally decided, two years after release, to bless fans of Zagreus and his Hades brethren with a fun line of items styled after the game's underworld denizens. While the full line is yet to be revealed, a teaser image appears to include long and short-sleeved shirts, art prints, and a badge set featuring Nyx, Thanatos, Megaera, and, of course, Zagreus himself. No Artemis or Tis, but it's fine.\nhttps://twitter.com/Fangamer/status/1549439138587222016?s=20&t=GrFE6W8m9nXAia2XjKzXrg\nPerhaps best of all, the image features plush dolls of two of The House of Hades' most important employees: three-headed, bone-munching Good Boy Cerberus, and the lovely, hardworking, and ever-fangirling housemaid, Dusa. Better still, the Dusa plush talks! Yes, I will be purchasing both of them.\nHopefully, the full range will include further shirt designs and/or other cool gubbins, but I'm still stunned by the possibility that Hades is yet to receive a lavish, hardcover art book — which seems an absolute given for such a striking-looking release. Regardless, the fun-looking Hades range is set to launch on the Fangamer site on Tuesday, July 26.\nFor my wallet, There is No Escape.\nThe post Hades finally has a merch range, courtesy of Fangamer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, the VR company announced the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset will get a price bump in August, tacking another $100 onto the price tag.\nThis will bring the Meta Quest 2 up to $399.99 for the 128 GB version, and the 256 GB version up to $499.99. Refurbished units and Meta Quest 2 accessories will also see a price increase.\nMeta, a.k.a. Facebook, bought Oculus in 2014 and shifted the naming convention away from Oculus and under Meta in 2021. In today's statement on the pricing change, the company acknowledges VR's momentum, but also cites the cost of production as a concern.\n\"At the same time, the costs to make and ship our products have been on the rise. By adjusting the price of Quest 2, we can continue to grow our investment in groundbreaking research and new product development that pushes the VR industry to new heights.\"\n\nThose who pick up a Meta Quest 2 headset between August 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 will get a freebie. A copy of Beat Saber will be free to download for 14 days, after they've activated the headset.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTIizcuSdHg\nThe cost of virtual reality\nThis is surprising on a few levels. First, the Quest 2 has been available since 2020. A price hike without a hardware refresh is strange, to say the least.\nBut the Oculus Quest 2, or Meta Quest 2, has been the affordable entry point to virtual reality. Its ability to run wireless or hooked up to a computer is a huge boon. And the price point made it a no-brainer for those looking to get into the technology.\nIt certainly ratchets up the potential appeal of other headsets. For those who already managed to grab a PlayStation 5, the PS VR2 is slowly but surely leading up to its eventual launch.\nThe post Meta Quest 2 VR headsets will get a price hike in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

But what if you aren't all about Sol, what if you're all about the mischievous but thoroughly loveable Jack-O Valentine? Well, fret not, as Apex Toys has also announced that the Halloween lovin' gal is getting her own figure at some point in the near future.\nAs revealed during WonFest 2022, (and reported by Siliconera), the new Jack-O figure is scaled at 1/9, which translates to roughly eight-to-nine inches in height... or at least she would, if she were standing upright. Y'see, Apex Toys has teased the new figure with a suspiciously familiar silhouette, suggesting that our girl will be sporting her back-breaking, censor-worrying, meme-creating, crouch pose — the very same pose that took the internet by storm last year in the form of the \"Jack-O Challenge.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/APEX_TOYS/status/1551013041780559873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1551013041780559873%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D336431action%3Dedit\nApex Toys did not release any other info in regards to the new Jack-O pose figure, so we don't know the release window, price, or pre-order dates. But given that we don't even get to see an unpainted prototype, or even any new concept art, we are probably still a long way out from having to explain to our friends and relatives why the centerpiece of our lounge is a young woman in a bodysuit and a Halloween mask is essentially... well... \"presenting.\"\nIt's a crouch pose, mom.

Ambrose Island is a new locale that's free for any owner of Hitman 3.\nThe update rolls out for anyone today, so long as they own a copy of Hitman 3 on their platform of choice. That does include Game Pass subscription owners, according to IO Interactive's announcement. The only exception is the Hitman 3 Free Starter Pack, which does not get access to Ambrose Island.\nThe patch rolled out at 9 a.m. ET this morning, on July 26, and is included in the patch. No need to download anything extra from the store.\nAs for what Agent 47 is getting up to in these tropical islands? Well, the opening cinematic released today can give you a clue. A former associate of Mr. Grey's needs taking care of, and that will have to include dealing with a local pirate syndicate and disrupting a satellite connection along the way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LWgJNXIOuw\nWith the update, there are also some new tools and challenges. A special wetsuit and massive machete are among the rewards. There's also a gas grenade with a poisonous frog trapped inside. And heck, even a fishing hook. Plus, new starting locations, stashes, and more await.\nThe future of Hitman\nWhile this brings a new locale and likely plenty of mayhem to Hitman 3, there's also more in store. IO Interactive has also been refreshing old content as well, adding new challenges and unlockable items.\nPlus, the evolving Freelancer mode is planned for somewhere further off in the future. It seems like the World of Assassination is not quite done with Hitman and Agent 47 yet.

This system hopes to give the wider community a \"heads up\" of sorts on some of the usernames that frequently find themselves blocked from channels.\nThe Shared Ban Info feature is the latest release in Twitch's increasing efforts to clamp down on toxic behavior, derogatory language, hate raids, and personal attacks logged against its huge streamer base. The service recently improved its notification system to signify to banned users exactly why they were banned, while its new Twitch Ban Evasion Tool was instilled in an effort to prevent banned users from returning under new guises.\nOnline toxicity remains one of gaming's biggest and most enduring problems. From headset chatter during online play, to the comment sections of websites, Twitch streams, YouTube videos, and social media accounts, the spreading of hateful, racist, and homophobic language have been emboldened by the general anonymity of the internet, as well as an overall lack of real consequence from the platforms that host the abuse.\nIt is a concern that is likely to continue as long as humans are able to interact with humans in a non-face-to-face capacity.

          "description": "Noclip does it again\nHere at Destructoid, we've covered the Bloodborne PSX demake fan project pretty comprehensively — mostly because it rules. The scope of the demake is insane, and now we have a full 40-minute documentary on how it was made thanks to the YouTube Channel Noclip.\nThe Noclip team actually had the chance to meet and speak with Lilith Walther, the creator of the Bloodborne demake. Walther was inspired by Photoshop mockups/renders of God of War 3, Uncharted 2, and BioShock demakes, and created a prototype of Bloodborne PSX in three weeks in 2017.\nIt goes through Walther's entire history of game development (and how they were spurred on by the complicated circuitry systems of LittleBigPlanet 2), through the origins of the demake itself. They talk about how a large part of the demake is meant to infuse old-school PSX-era systems into the game beyond just the raw aesthetic, including clunky UI elements (referred to as \"rolling back quality of life systems\").\nThey also wax poetic about how fun old-school game design could be, and how quality-of-life features can potentially muddy the waters and put a damper on exploration. As someone who has grown up with games since the Atari, I've seen both the good and the bad of this philosophy, and while streamlining/quality of life has had a positive impact overall, in the subsector of action-adventure titles, I see exactly what Walther is saying here. Definitely check out the doc if you're remotely interested in game design or Bloodborne!\nAs a reminder, you can get the project and check it out for yourself right here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=OZBNbU1TedI\nThe post Here’s a comprehensive look at the Bloodborne PSX demake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Play the hit indie game Papers, Please on your mobile devices\nOriginally released all the way back in 2013, Papers, Please is a legendary indie game that helped reimagine what a video game can be. In the game, players take on the role of a government border control agent in a fictional country called Arstotzka, and must decide who gets to come into the country while on the lookout for fake passports. Of course, it's never as easy as it appears, because players' morality is tested when asylum seekers and other people in need ask to be let through. It's a fairly simply game, mechanically speaking, but its story is one that has stuck with players for nearly a decade now.\nPapers, Please is set to release on mobile platforms on August 5, 2022, as was announced by a tweet from the game's creator, Lucas Pope. Based on the picture he included, the game also looks like it's been optimized for a vertical format, so you won't even have to turn your phone sideways to play. Pope also said that some of the in-game timers have been adjusted, and the interface is \"completely different,\" so there's only one booth upgrade. Papers, Please will be getting a standalone mobile release, as opposed to some subscription-based releases that have become more common recently.\nPope was all jokes in the Twitter replies, saying that the console release was coming in 2031 and, when another game dev sarcastically asked about a VR release, replied simply with \"unlike.\" I do love game developers with a sense of humor.\nhttps://twitter.com/dukope/status/1550895020861181952\nIf you've still yet to play this indie classic, this mobile release could be the perfect way to do it. Sure, it might be a little intense to play on the go at times, but the game makes for a really compelling pocket-sized experience. You can play through the story campaign, or give the endless mode a try, but either way you can't really go wrong.\nThe post Papers, Please is getting a mobile release soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Appearances can be deceiving\nYou are on a quest to a cabin. And inside the cabin, there is a princess. But as the name implies, Slay the Princess is not necessarily about a valiant rescue.\nRather, you're going to have to do some slaying.\nDeveloper Black Tabby Games announced its next project, Slay the Princess, today. And it is a good pitch. You're on your way to a cabin in the woods to kill a princess. Do this, and you'll save the world. Fail, and you doom it. But she's a princess, right? How bad could she really be?\nWell, watch the trailer below and draw your own conclusions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RByDoYQpFa8\nThe story plays on trust, choice, and of course, lots of horror. Because despite any immediate takes on the matter, this princess is a lot more than just that. As the Steam page notes, you will probably die a lot on your quest. Also, don't try to romance her, or talk to her, or hear her out. But also, who's to say this narrator is trustworthy either?\n\nNot quite a knight in shining armor\nSlay the Princess is a really cool concept, and from a pretty interesting team too. Black Tabby Games had some word-of-mouth going about a previous horror adventure, Scarlet Hollow. It's clear the team has some chops when it comes to writing interesting horror narratives.\nPlus, from the trailer alone, the art style looks fantastic. And the voice work from Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight adds a ton, too. It reminds me a bit of fellow pencil-sketch horror game Mundaun, mixed with a visual novel-style presentation. With some branching paths, possible loops, and probably some secrets to uncover, Black Tabby Games has my attention.\nSlay the Princess is aiming for a 2023 launch. Those who can't wait can get early access to a two-hour demo through Black Tabby's Patreon here.\nThe post Slay the Princess is a horror game about a very scary princess coming next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Swords & Solcery\nThe weekend's San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) brought with it a wide variety of plastic fantastics, as various merch-makers showed off tabletops full of figurines, statues, and other paraphernalia related to some of the biggest and most popular global gaming brands. Storm Collectibles was in attendance, shining a spotlight on various upcoming Street Fighter and Darkstalkers figures for its partner, Capcom.\nBut Guilty Gear fans did not go away empty-handed, as Storm also brought with them the completed prototype of GG's hard-edged and hard-edgy poster boy Sol Badguy. The new premium figure sees the badass bounty hunter ready to lay the smack down on his next opponent, armed with his faithful and ferocious blade, Outrage MkII. The Sol Badguy figure features a finely sculpted, fully poseable body and comes complete with five pairs of interchangeable hands, three head sculpts, and an optional flame effect to punctuate his more dynamic poses.\nhttps://twitter.com/stormcohk/status/1551498418056339456?s=20&t=ADr7XpjkQWw16PCSzXQ9fQ\nStorm, curiously, has not listed the height of the new figure, but Sol Badguy is listed in their 1/12 scale category, so we can probably expect him to stand between 10-to-12 inches. Retailing for a very princely $95 (not including shipping), pre-orders for Sol are live over on the official Storm Collectibles website, ahead of his expected release window of early 2023 — which is quite a fast turnaround for a modern collectible.\nSadly, there was no sign of any Testament figures, statues, or models at SDCC this year. Oh well, maybe next time. If you want to take a look at Storm's Street Fighter reveals from the weekend's event, then be sure to check out our Street Fighter SDCC 2022 roundup article right here.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC.\nThe post Storm Collectibles opens pre-orders on Guilty Gear Sol Badguy figure appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The newest development involves collectible magazines and cars\nThe Fallout London mod, a fan creation that's built off of the Fallout 4 foundation, looks better and better every time I see something new pop up for it. That includes this most recent post from the game's Twitter account.\nFallout London will be bringing back the \"magazine pickups that boost your stats\" conceit from the core series, but with a UK-based twist. Now some of the mags will be centered around London upgrades, including owner and repair manuals for in-game cars. The aesthetic is based on the Haynes Manual line: a UK publisher that's produced a long-running (since the '60s) series of manuals mostly focused around the automotive industry. Cars that will be featured in the game include the Routemaster, Tater T, P90, and Cutlass varieties.\nAll this lines up with what the development team has said in the past regarding how they want Fallout London to feel different: \"As a divergence from previous official titles in the series, Fallout London is not set in America. Visiting a totally new setting allows for us to explore totally new cultures which have not homogenized with their American counterparts. It also allows us to explore pre-war European history, and the effects the Resource Wars had on the class structured society of pre-war Britain.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/FalloutLondon/status/1550580481363935232\nFallout London release date\nThe mod is still slated for a 2023 release, as of this past month.

Here's the rundown:\n\"For the first Title Update, we're adding new content regarding Anomaly Research. In relation to that, here's a sneak peek at Qurious Crafting, which allows for armor upgrades. The upgrades utilize new materials that will be added with the update. Please look forward to more news!\"\n\nIn short, you'll be using reagents from the update to augment your armor. The details are still coming, but some of the community surmises that different materials will provide different stats. Either way, more armor customization is generally a good thing, and will likely lead to crazier builds and faster clear times for speedrunners. Anomaly quest grinding is already popular for a lot of players, so this could add even more replay value: on top of the new monsters and extra content coming.\nAs a reminder, Capcom has provided a glimpse into what's next for the game via an official roadmap.

          "description": "It's raining raptors\nAt San Diego Comic-Con this weekend, Capcom debuted a brand new trailer for its upcoming Jurassic lark, Exoprimal, which remains currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe new preview focuses specifically on the reptilian roster of dinosaurs and \"NeoSaurs\" that are running amok throughout our future cities. Like a scaly version of Earth Defense Force, we see the streets literally swarming with creatures, as our desperate but highly skilled squad of Exofighters attempt to put a halt to the dawn of a new prehistoric era. Check out the wild action for yourself below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQNlDJ2I59s\nA lot of monstrous city mashers on display there, from the natural horrors of the Pteranodon, Ankylosaurus, and the Triceratops to a new wave of creatures including the Pyro Neosaur, Neo Ankylosaurus, and the devastating Neo T. Rex. I think my favorite part is the very absurd moment when an enormous herd of Velociraptors is literally seen spilling from the skies.\nI'm not entirely sure of the specific corner of the market Exoprimal is aiming for, nor whether it will succeed in capturing long-term multiplayer interest but — as you can see in the new trailer above — it's shaping up to be a good-looking title, with some interesting concepts and exciting action. We shall see. If you wish to be considered for closed beta access, then you can sign-up right now over on the official Exoprimal website.\nExoprimal is currently expected to launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox at some point in 2023.\nThe post Exoprimal introduces its roster of reptilian overlords in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You can see the Breath of the Wild split-screen mod in action below\nA Zelda: Breath of the Wild split-screen multiplayer mod is like a dream come true, especially if it can be done with extra processing power. Well, dream no more.\nCreated by modder Kirbymimi, the mod adds multiplayer to the popular action-adventure romp. As the modder notes, the project was spurred by the desire to create new emergent situations that are only possible through the power of multiplayer, like sneaking into a bokoblin camp with one player serving as a distraction, while the other does a pincer maneuver. Or, spur-of-the-moment events like a plain old-fashioned shield race down a cliff, or taking down a boss together.\nThe mod actually supports up to four players, but right now there are some technical limitations. As is, using the link above, everyone shares the same screen, so a button to teleport everyone to the lead player is needed. However, as the popular YouTube channel Waikuteru points out, split-screen is also possible thanks to a beta version of the mod that's coming out on July 29.\nNow there are still technical limitations. As Waikuteru notes, the game \"starts to lag if people are too far away\" from one another, so it's best for everyone to stay in the same area for the Breath of the Wild split-screen mod. Still, we can expect further refinements down the line, and the fact that this is even possible is amazing.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k8nEA-y7E4\nThe post Oh look, a Zelda: Breath of the Wild split-screen multiplayer mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nacon and Daedalic Entertainment are pushing the launch of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum back a few months to an indeterminate date.\nNo more has been confirmed about Gollum's new date, except that it is \"a few months\" out from its original. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was previously set to launch on September 1, 2022.\nIn a statement on the delay, Daedalic says it has been pushed in order to deliver the \"best possible experience\" for the Gollum game. An update more exact timing will arrive sometime in the near future.\nhttps://twitter.com/GollumGame/status/1551598260732792832\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum is slotted to launch on both generations of Xbox and PlayStation hardware, as well as PC and the Nintendo Switch.

We reached out to clarify, but were told Daedalic has no further comment at this time.\nWaiting in the darkness\nGollum's very own video game is a bit different than the hack-and-slash or role-playing games you might be used to from the Lord of the Rings game.\nRather, it's a stealth affair, suited to Gollum's own talents of sneaking around and leaping onto people's backs. Plus, balancing the careful line between Smeagol and Gollum, and getting the narrative bits right. Although one section of this cinematic trailer where Gollum dumps lava on some orcs looks pretty alright.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJn2AjYOIJA\nWhile the Fellowship had their time in the spotlight, Lord of the Rings: Gollum will give the little hobbit who's down on his luck his due.

You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. \nWhile Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions.

By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. \nThe play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. \nLastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.\nPlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.\nWhat do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2?

Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown.\" McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. \nIs this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below! \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. \nFans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart.

Tolkien.\n\nThat being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.\n\nWe are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!\n\nDaedalic Entertainment\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring.

According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. \nCan confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.\nJuly 23, 2022\nThe director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. \nUltimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent. \n[Source: The Verge]",

This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. \n\n\nThe update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. \nIf you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. \nThe towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. \nIf you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.",

          "description": "Warner Bros. Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.\nSlated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.\nThe skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.\nFollowing the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.",

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.\nAlong with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.\nIf you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.\nYour time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.\nAre you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?",

          "description": "Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.\nThe publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. \n\n\nSplinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. \nUbisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities.\" \nWhat do you think of these cancellations?

The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. \nUnfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”\nUbisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.",

But what do dogs (the superior pet, if we're being honest with ourselves) think about this feline adventure? \nWe've enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my lap while I play the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask! \nBut that's not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me use my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I now have to do something work-related with it.

There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.\nIn creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn.

          "description": "Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. \nFor those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. \nThe new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. \n\n\nDragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.",

          "description": "In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.\nHowever, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.\nSega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.\nRead more...",

          "description": "No Man’s Sky’s 20th free update, Endurance, soars into the game today. Hello Games describes Endurance as an “overhaul” to the freighter captain experience, giving players new tools and functionality that make commanding a fleet of ships more entertaining and manageable. \nPlayers can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. \n\n\nEndurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.",

The game’s reveal caught my eye thanks to its striking art direction and unique gameplay. I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters.

In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts.

These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. \n\n\nNo More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: \n“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”",

Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will \"carry forward our vision for the game.\"\nThe blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: \nLast December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development.

Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. \n\nThe Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”\nThe Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99.

Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:\n\"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series.\"\n\nI'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not. \n[Source: Famitsu via VGC]",

Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. \nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.\nWe were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.\nYou can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

You can also go to the studio's official website to solve a puzzle to see additional concept art and screens.\nWarframe has long been one of the most successful free-to-play games out there, almost coming on a decade since release. You can take a look at what is coming next to this wild sci-fi expeirence in the trailer below.",

          "description": "Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!\n\n\nMarcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.\nOn top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.",
