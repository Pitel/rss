Cloud streaming could get around this, but it only makes sense if the cloud tech and the machines actually running the game server-side are up to the task.

You have several different speeds, moderated by two different firing modes and the 'L' and 'ZL' triggers, which slow you down to a crawl if desired. Teleports work on a quick recharge basis and can be used to get out of clinches, but you need a moment to prep it before you can use it, and this timing requires expert precision and knowledge in later stages.

          "description": "Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.\nThen Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.\nRead more",

A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I'd seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: \"I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.\"\nMy second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. \"Oh shite.

          "description": "I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live.\nThis is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I've never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.\nThat is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.\nRead more",

Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...\nIn fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.\nRead more",

This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating.

As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. \nAfter Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.\nRead more",

The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them!

It wasn't a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.\nThis was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.\n Read more",

          "description": "Horror games are usually a bit too scary for me to play alone. I actually barely manage to play them at all, though not for lack of trying. Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.\nIf you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you're looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam's done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.\nRead more",

This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won't like. I don't want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don't want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).\nAs it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I'm not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I'd sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn't played it for a while. Maybe it wasn't how I remembered. Maybe I'd changed, you know?\nRead more",

History! That's really smart,\" he tells me. \"Like, there's no need to explain anything to people. You don't have to be like, oh, there's a laser gun or this is a magic missile. It's like, it's a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”\r\n\n\r\nTo Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it's just outlasted everything else.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.\nTrying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.\nRead more",

Not because we're die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we're both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we've been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there's been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I've often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.\nI was beginning to think I'd lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village's Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It's been a while, hasn't it?\nRead more",

It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don't steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.\nThis puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven't played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you're missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, \"Yes\". The long answer is, \"Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably\".\nRead more",

Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. \r\n\n\r\nIt didn't help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady's trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day.

          "description": "There's a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I've been banging my head against all week. It's an uphill fort siege where you're facing off against an evil necromancer who's shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone's mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you've just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. \nTactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it's clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you'd learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I'm still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn's opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.\nRead more",

          "description": "About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.\r\n\n\r\nI was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The game was created by a teeny tiny team, but the whole project was the brainchild of Edmund McMillen, who also created Super Meat Boy, another indie classic. His new game, Mewgenics, has been in the works for over a decade now, but for the first time in years, we finally have an update on the title -- or more specifically, an actual release window.\nMewgenics is a \"turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats,\" according to the game's Steam page, and will allow players to \"hoard, breed, train, and set cats out on epic adventures through a sprawling world of complete chaos.\" The release window is currently listed as \"sometime in 2024 (hopefully),\" and while that's a while to wait, it's just nice to know that the game is still coming out at all. It also looks like it's going to have the same dark, twisted sense of humor that McMillen is known for. I mean, just look at this gif he posted as the announcement of the Steam page going live:\nhttps://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1586047233715101696\nOther features of the game listed on the Steam page include \"100s of hours of gameplay,\" \"6+ classes, each with 50+ unique abilities to draft from,\" \"200+ enemies and bosses that will upset your mom,\" and many more. We already know that McMillen has an eye for some of the most engaging gameplay out there, and Mewgenics looks like it's shaping up to be his most complex project yet. I know I'm pumped to give it a try when it drops eventually, and it'll be interesting to see how the creator's design sensibilities have evolved over time.\nThe post Mewgenics, the new game from the Binding of Isaac creator, has a release window appeared first on Destructoid.",

But ahead of that, IO Interactive is hosting a closed technical test in November.\nThe Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will take place on November 3 through 7. The closed technical test will only be available on PC via Steam, and it will be a separate game, with a download code delivered by IO if you're chosen.\nSign-ups for the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test are live here.\nWe also got a pretty decently sized gameplay video today, showcasing just how Hitman 3: Freelancer works. The walkthrough shows off many different aspects of the roguish new mode: picking contracts, planning, touring the home base, and then setting out for a mission.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZZlIMdavM\nEven Agent 47 is part of the gig economy\nThe mode will pose a bunch of new challenges and options to players, based around the maps of the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy.\nFor the closed technical test, only a select portion of the pool will be available. The nine available maps are: Paris, Sapienza, Hokkaido, Miami, Mumbai, Whittleton Creek, Dartmoor, Berlin, and Mendoza.\nThe full Freelancer mode will have just about every map, barring three. The ICA Facility, Hawke's Bay, and the Carpathian Mountains will be the only locales not in the full Freelancer launch.\n\nWhile there is progression within the closed technical test, that mastery will not carry over to the full launch.\nBut this new way of playing Hitman has looked like a cool alternative for awhile now. I'm sure some players are probably eager to tinker with the possibilities in it. They'll be getting their chance in November, ahead of the full launch at the start of the new year.\nThe post Hitman 3: Freelancer will have a closed technical test in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game featured are Neo Geo shmup Andro Dunos (1992); futuristic sports game Flip Shot (1997) and its sequel Bang Bead (2000); side-scrolling actioner Ganryu (1999); rally racer Neo Drift Out (1996), soccer title Goal! Goal! Goal! (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup Captain Tomaday (1999).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7lDgAJ63Uc\nNo further details have been announced, so we do not know whether the collection will include online play, save states, a museum mode, or any of the other features typical of other retro collections — such as Capcom Arcade Stadium. There are some fun titles bundled here, though the only one I remember seeing quite commonly on the scene is Neo Drift Out. Importantly, however, Captain Tomaday is finally about to get his day in the sun, enjoying the fame and fortune that eluded the winged fruit during his initial run — smothered by the encroaching concerns of The Millennium Bug, no doubt.\nVisco Collection is currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Visco Collection compiles a fistful of forgotten arcade releases appeared first on Destructoid.",

The lo-fi survival adventure is currently in development for PC at indie outfit Sutemi Productions. A release date was not revealed.\nIn My Work is Not Yet Done, players will take control of Avery, the last surviving member of an investigative who trekked deep into strange and uncharted country to source a mysterious radio transmission. A brain-heavy piece, the new title will combine investigative and analytical mystery alongside the simulation of surviving as a single person in a changing, isolated, and deeply unnerving environment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC0fSDi5b4g\nAs Avery, players will be tasked with continuing the work of her departed investigative team, staying one step ahead of death and insanity while uncovering the clues that will lead to an almost indecipherable phenomenon. From the official blurb, My Work is Not Yet Done appears doom-laden, suggesting that the team's — Avery's — task may be unfinishable, as each and every day brings with it further mystery, more questions than answers, and the smothering cloud of both isolation and mortal fear. Heavy stuff.\nRegardless, with its creepy, staccato imagery, immersive atmosphere, and non-linear approach to adventure, Sutemi's new release might prove to be a real sleeper hit for those who like their horror a little on the cerebral side.

We will restock the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game once more later this year, on [the] My Nintendo Store.\"\n\nThe tweet then goes on to provide a link for update registration here.\nMeanwhile, in the US, Bayonetta 1 has been available at several retailers, and is readily in stock at the time of writing at Best Buy. It actually went up for sale weeks ago (I got my copy a while back), and is holding stock. So the \"limited quantities\" Nintendo spoke of in the past seem to be region-based.\nOutside of the regional Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages, this isn't the first hectic rodeo from a My Nintendo Store rollout. Xenoblade 3 was rife with access problems, with virtual queues that didn't work, or crashed randomly. Ideally Nintendo will stop doing exclusives like this in any region, as the demand clearly exceeds whatever Nintendo has in mind in terms of a sustainable approach to taking pre-orders.\nIn the meantime, if you really want it and don't want to wait on a mystery restock window (or potentially deal with a broken website again), importing from the US could be an option. Secondhand markets aren't selling it at obscene prices just yet, and some stores might ship overseas.\nThe post Nintendo UK apologizes for Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages, says more are coming this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Initially developed by Visco Corporation, both Breakers (1996) and its revamped edition, Breakers' Revenge (1998) have been spruced up with a fab collection of modern-day features. These include rollback netcode, crossplay functionality, a Team Battle mode, a deep training mode, player profiles, new character color options, and a fantastic Interactive Replay mode, which gives players the opportunity to relive their losses and experiment to find out what alternate paths could have been taken.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzTmTFxuVsI\nInitially announced way back in 2019, it would seem that a simple rerelease of two '90s fighters should not have taken this long to reach fruition. However, it is clear that developer QuByte has gone all out to deliver an excellent package for these cult classics, ensuring that the ever-faithful Breakers community (and yes, it does exist) will receive the perfect product to allow them to take these funky fighters into the next generation and beyond.\nMy girl Rila has has been benched for far too long, and those nails of hers are ready for action.\nBreakers Collection launches January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

We will release an update soon to fix this issue. In the meantime, Rainmaker has been temporarily removed from Anarchy Battle. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nSo in short, as described by reliable dataminer OatmealDome, the actual bug involves a score counter reset if you touch a checkpoint. That's...instant-shutdown worthy for a competitive mode. Funnily enough I've seen some chatter in my circles that some folks seem to like it: as they didn't enjoy Rainmaker anyway, and are enjoying it being out of the rotation.\nWhile I'm still really enjoying Splatoon 3, it's been hit by multiplayer bugs since launch, including connection issues. That last patch had roughly 100 fixes, so it was bound to mess up something else. It's the Bethesda open world RPG patch effect! That's pretty much how every major Fallout 76 patch played out in the early days, with a minor patch afterward to smooth things out.\n[Update: As of October 28, Nintendo has implemented patch 1.2.1, which fixes the Rainmaker problems stated above.

While this number, in itself, is already the highest number of concurrent CoD Steam players to date, this isn't even the peak, as MW2 already hit a pretty nutso high of 238,522 players during its first hour of launch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeVapCrI1pY\nThat's a stunning 100,000+ players more than the previous record, which has been held by the original Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer since 2010. Once North America wakes up and has its first cup of Joe, it will be interesting to see if this peak number can be smashed even further. Of course, this Steam count represents only one faction of the CoD playerbase, with many choosing to play on PlayStation, Xbox, or Activision Blizzard's own Battle.net app.\nThe success of the newest Call of Duty title has been something of an annual inevitability, with even \"lesser\" entries such as last year's Call of Duty: Vanguard still pulling in sales numbers and player figures that most games can only dream of. And it seems, some 18 years from the series' initial inception — and despite perpetual complaints that the series has \"peaked\" — Call of Duty will remain one of video gaming's most lucrative and fiscally reliable franchises.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 sees series’ biggest Steam launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Overall, a \"Complete Edition\" should age very well for hardcore action fans, especially given the \"challenge\" aspect of the DLCs.\nIf you want to read more about how the team incorporated feedback into their post-launch design perspective, we have a full interview with key members of the team here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6HEY5ix0rw\nThe post Stranger of Paradise continues to add quality of life features, like transmog appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Heading for Tony Stark levels of wealth?\nFree-to-play mobile card game Marvel Snap has already gotten off to a smashing start, having raked in a staggering $2 million USD in revenue since its launch just one week ago. Available on PC and mobile platforms, the card combat title has already been downloaded by some 5.3 million players.\nMarvel Snap is a strategic card battler that focuses on the heroes and villains of the legendary comic-book universe. Players engage in battles, single-player challenges, and objective-based modes with their chosen hand of heroes, set against the backdrop of famous locales from the Marvel universe. Part of the title's attraction is in slick visual style and library of quality Marvel artwork, as well as its speedy gameplay — The average battle takes around three-to-four minutes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ\nThe data, which was compiled by AppMagic and reported by mobilegamer.biz, shows that the United States has, unsurprisingly, been the most popular territory for downloads, counting for some 1.3 million players and $1.2 million in revenue. Marvel Snap's second territory of popularity is Brazil, with 433,000 players, and then Italy, with 342,000. The iOS version of the title has the lion's share of the player base.\nThis is rad and all, but shout me when Jessica Drew shows up.\nMarvel Snap is available now on PC, iOS, and Android platforms. You can check out CJ Andriessen's thoughts on the title right here. Additionally, to help you get started, check out our own Eric van Allen's beginner tips right here.

          "description": "The first Modern Warfare II DLC honors those in the military\nThe newest mainline Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, is out tomorrow, and fans are beyond excited to get into the game. There's a lot to try out with the new multiplayer maps and the single-player campaign, plus the revamped battle royale mode that's coming out in November, and as if that wasn't enough, Activision already announced the game's first DLC. It's called the Endowment Protector pack, and it's already available for purchase at the in-game store.\nAll of the proceeds from the Modern Warfare II DLC will go to Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty Endowment, the company's very own charity that assists military veterans in the US and UK in finding new jobs after they return from service. The pack will run players $10, with proceeds from the sales going directly to the Call of Duty Endowment up to $4 million. The most notable items in the pack include a skin called \"The Protector\" for Operator Hutch, along with blueprints for the Protector's Companion rifle and the Duty Calls sniper rifle. The rest of the items are as follows:\n\"Frontline Stripes\" Vehicle Skin\n\"Tagged\" Weapon Charm\n\"Ready for Anything\" Animated Calling Card\n\"Mermen\" Calling Card\n\"Seeing Double\" Static Animated Emblem\nOne Double XP Token, One Double Weapon XP Token\n\nAs another special perk for those who serve, Activision has also partnered with USAA to give the Protector Pack away completely free to current and former members of the military in the US. The Call of Duty series relies entirely on the stories and real-life actions of military members (like pulling from real-life battles, for example), so it seems only fitting that they would give some of their massive profits back to those who inspired the games in the first place. I would love to see Activision do even more to support vets in the future, but for now, this is a good enough place to start.\nThe post Proceeds from this Modern Warfare II DLC go to charity for military veterans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A new interface is coming to the PC-TV setup\nValve is planning to update its Big Picture viewing mode with the new interface it designed for the Steam Deck. The Steam manufacturer has the new user interface on the beta right now.\nThis update was announced a while ago, but it looks like it could be rolling out soon. Already, the feature is available in the Steam client through its beta options.\nAs detailed in a news post, you just need to opt into the Steam Client beta. Then, head over to the properties and add the \"-gamepadui\" launch parameter. There's also a forum open for feedback.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvokyBOYe8Y\nBig Picture is Valve's special set-up for users who want a Steam UI that's more conducive to a TV set-up. And since that often entails a gamepad in hand, the Steam Deck UI does seem like a good fit.\nThe updated Big Picture mode now includes a new Home Screen, a Universal Search, and optimized Steam Store for controller navigation.\nA new configurator should make it easier for adjusting and creating custom controller configurations. And updated game overlay, system menu, and quick access menu should hopefully make jaunting around Steam's interfaces easier.\nA new lens\nI've been spending more and more time using my Steam Deck, and have also used the old Steam Big Picture UI a fair bit, and have to say: this all feels like a good upgrade.\nThe user interface certainly isn't the sole reason that Steam Decks are becoming pretty darn popular, but the general experience on them is solid. I've had little trouble navigating its menus or finding what I need to.\nSo for those who play PC on the TV or still have a Steam Link stashed away somewhere, this is nice to see. The beta is currently live to opt into and test out for yourself.\nThe post Valve is letting users test Steam Deck UI in Big Picture mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

The sci-fi adventure is set to hit on November 15, for Xbox consoles and PC.\nDeveloper Jumpship dropped the release date in a new trailer today, confirming its November launch. Somerville is set to arrive on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and is also coming to Xbox Game Pass.\nThis narrative thriller follows a family caught up in the immediate repercussions of an extraterrestrial conflict. As explosions and mysterious visitors descend, it looks like the player will be trying to keep their family whole as they escape.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb0jh956VVU\nWe've been seeing teasers for Somerville for quite a while now. The IP is created by Chris Olsen and built in collaboration with former Playdead CEO and co-founder Dino Patti.\nSo yes, it has some of that Inside energy. Both side-scrolling action and tense sequences look to be in store here.\nOut of this world\nIt's a bit of a surprise, to suddenly see a date on Somerville. But it's a very welcome one. Somerville has looked pretty striking in its appearances over the years at various showcases.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcjnHHxHV3o\nThis also bolsters out the Game Pass library, which is pretty nice. While I like being able to access just about every Halo and Fallout under the sun, the bonus of Game Pass has been seeing projects like these get a solid bump. Immortality and Signalis both hit the service at launch, and Obsidian's upcoming historical RPG adventure Pentiment is also currently set for November.\nNovember is looking like a good time to settle it for a weekend in Somerville.\nThe post Sci-fi thriller Somerville arrives in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Announced this week via the below trailer (presented by Deadpool), it'll bring more characters into the fray.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blw2Q0YZI_E\nHere's what we have so far for the Midnight Suns season pass:\nDLC Content Pack 1 - Deadpool - A foulmouthed mercenary with a heart of gold, Deadpool has a penchant for grisly violence and lighthearted, fourth-wall breaking wisecracks.\nDLC Content Pack 2 - Venom - Spider-Man’s nemesis and one of the main game’s bosses, Venom turns playable hero in DLC #2, armed with all of the same symbiote attacks that once threatened the lives of the Midnight Suns.\nDLC Content Pack 3 - Morbius - One of the original comic book Midnight Sons, Morbius is an accomplished biochemist who, in an attempt to cure his own rare blood disease, turned himself into a living vampire.\nDLC Content Pack 4 - Storm - A powerful member of the X-Men, Storm has the ability to generate and manipulate wind, lightning, rain, and other types of weather to her will.\nYes, Deadpool makes a \"Morbin' Time\" joke in the video.\nAccording to 2K, the pass will also be sprinkled with additional content beyond the characters; like more levels and items. Midnight Suns is still slated for a December 2 release on PC, PS4, PS5, and Series X/S. The Switch version and prior generations are allegedly coming later, though there's no date in sight, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were canceled.\nAs one of the last big games of 2022 , I think I speak for strategy and Marvel enthusiasts alike when I say that I hope this one is worth it.

Armed with an array of ground and pound grapples and haymaker strikes, this former abductee turned MMA monster is ready to help Kyoko, Misako, and her other allies in another adventure, (or should that be \"ABventure. God...DAMN), against the ruthless Sabu crime family.\nIf our heroes weren't tough enough before, then shit just got a whole lot tougher.\nRiver City Girls 2 will launch later this year on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.\nThe post Marian is done with damsel schtick in River City Girls 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Green(ish) Light\nMicrosoft has released its financial details for the first quarter of its fiscal year — While the statistics are something of a mixed bag, it has been a significant, positive season for the Xbox brand, with strong hardware sales leading to an overall revenue increase of around 11% year-on-year.\nThe continuing economic slump has been tough on Microsoft, which has seen a decline in many of its sectors. Revenue for operating software Windows dropped by a mighty 15%, while Xbox game sales were also down by a much more manageable 3%. The drop in game sales is likely due to the worldwide cost of living crisis, as well as an increased interest in subscription service Xbox Game Pass. Thus, even if Xbox game sales are down, there is something to be said for Game Pass' growth.\n\nMore positive news came in the form of the publisher's Intelligent Cloud server division, which saw a stellar year-on-year revenue increase of 20%. As previously mentioned, much of Xbox's decline was offset by the growing sales of Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles. The sales of Xbox hardware and engagement with the Xbox Game Pass service — now boasting over 20 million subscribers — will clearly look to carry to load as Microsoft pushes through this continued downswing in customer spending.\nOf course, the more negative elements of the report are hardly about to bankrupt the company. Microsoft's overall revenue for the period still totals somewhere in the region of $50 billion USD, while its net income, even with a huge 14% drop, still saw the company pull in around $17.6 billion. MS is not going to be scratching for change anytime soon.\nIt should also be noted that the publisher recently laid off hundreds of employees across its entire workforce. Additionally, MS remains adamant in seeking approval for its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nThe post Microsoft revenue boosted as Xbox hardware sales offset income losses appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's an oldie but a goodie, and one people deserve to own forever. If you haven't played it yet, make sure you do it! There isn't much I can say about New Vegas that I haven't said already: it's a classic.\nThe rest of the lineup is decidedly less hard-hitting, but you might find something in there: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Facility 47, WRC 9, Etherborn, Whispering Willows, and Last Day of June. Yes, it's that Indiana Jones game, from 1989. It's not the film, and it's not anything recent. I had to do a double take on that one. Wildly, there were three core iterations of game adaptations for Last Crusade: a PC action game, a classic PC adventure title (the Prime Gaming one), and a console platformer.\nAll of these will be available starting November 1.

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.\nMarvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts.

Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. \nThe game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively.

We respected her,\" confirming her death. \nSega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. \n\"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,\" Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. \nKodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.\nOther credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia.

You can watch the official reveal below.\n\n\nOn Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:\nThat second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.\nGreavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.\nIf you’re hungry for more Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out our hands-on preview, or watch the games’ most recent trailer here.\nHow do you feel about this new Pokémon?

We've received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we've even previewed the game (read here). \nNow, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new \"Into The Night\" Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there's a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today's trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it'd be such a great Halloween game – but it's not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it's released.

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",

You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn't a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday's trailer is any indication. \nCheck out the new Resident Evil 4 remake trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more, watch the first Resident Evil 4 remake trailer and then read our review of Resident Evil 4 VR.

The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels stra…",

          "description": "Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.\nAs a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…",

Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.\nThe event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.\" The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn't offer any more information. \nIn your restless dreams, do you see that town?\n#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa\nOctober 16, 2022\nKonami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014's P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima's canceled Silent Hills. \nFor years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!",
