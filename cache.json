It has been nine years since Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam was released as the last new entry. Since then, Superstar Saga and Bowser's Inside Story received 3DS remakes, but then developer AlphaDream shut up shop in 2019 after filing for bankruptcy. In short, we weren't all that hopeful that the Bros. would be back in town any time soon.\nThen the June 2024 Nintendo Direct happened, opening, no less, with the announcement that the plumbing pair would be leaping back into action. The Mario & Luigi: Brothership reveal showcased a new art style, plenty of slapstick humour, OTT turn-based shenanigans and bro-specific button inputs — yes, it looked like a Mario & Luigi RPG of old. The question was, would it feel like one? Would it live up to the high bar set by its predecessors, or is that whimsical magic a product of a different handheld generation?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It ticks plenty of the boxes to appeal to fans of those games, offering a colourful cast of characters, an ambitious narrative, and classic turn-based combat, but there is a lack of polish that keeps this story of sky pirates from soaring as high as its lofty aspirations.\nThe opening cutscene feels promising, with vibrant characters in exotic locales set to a fun, if generic, J-pop tune. We were absolutely rooting for this title from dev Octeto Studios and publisher PQube, who have delivered plenty of fun indie games over the years. Unfortunately, our experience was marred almost immediately by bugs and unwieldy controls that made Sky Oceans nearly unplayable.

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive delayed jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.\nSpeaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have \"higher expectations\" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.\n Read more",

This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been \"mythologised\" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply \"wouldn't fly today\".\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.\nThere's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. \n Read more",

While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.\nAnd then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.\nRead more",

Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.\nMetaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.\nRead more",

I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.\nAt the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.\nRead more",

I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.\nLurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. \r\n \nRead more",

It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary.

Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws.

Good, because you need it to stay alive in this horror game about getting stalked through metro stations by a tall creep that nobody else on the platform can perceive. Crowded Followed is basically a playable It Follows, the 2014 horror movie and overt metaphor for sexually transmitted disease. Only this time the slow but unstoppable entity is following you because you picked up a mysterious briefcase from a dying man in an alleyway. I thought I told you to stop accepting random bloodsoaked objects from strange men? Quit it! Anyway, there's a demo for it on Steam if you like.\nRead more",

          "description": "One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.\nFortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.\nRead more",

Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.\nThat is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.\n \nRead more",

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.\nRead more",

According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.\n Read more",

The Xeon 6900P series showed they could tango with the AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa/Bergamo processors in a number of areas, but Genoa has been around since November 2022... With today's AMD 5th Gen EPYC \"Turin\" launch, Zen 5 is coming to servers and delivers stunning performance and power efficiency. The new top-end AMD EPYC Turin processor performance can obliterate the competition in most workloads and delivers a great generational leap in performance and power efficiency. Here are our first 5th Gen AMD EPYC Turin benchmarks in looking at the EPYC 9575F, EPYC 9755, and EPYC 9965 processors across many workloads and testing in both single and dual socket configurations.",

As your favorite Eliksni make their appearances, you'll be guided through the foundation for how this episode will work. One critical part is performing fieldwork with and for Eido. Yet, finding the Act I Fieldwork tab is surprisingly tricky.\n\n\nHow to access the Act I Fieldwork Tab in Revenant\n\n\nTo access the Act I Fieldwork Tab, speak to Eido in her apothecary in The Last City. It's the green icon with the potion on it. Once accessed, you'll see three categories: Minor Fieldwork, Major Fieldwork, and Key Fieldwork.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThe problem many players, including myself, run into at this part is the instructions at the bottom of the screen never go away despite accessing the tab. By the time it appeared for me, I had already acquired the fieldwork and was ready to go. The fix for this bug is as simple as returning to orbit.\n\n\nThis bug has persisted in various forms for the past several years. It's annoying, to be sure, but once you learn to recognize it, the \"fix\" is easy. It serves as a painful reminder that Bungie leadership doesn't have its priorities straight, and the remaining staff's talents are being misused. \n\n\nAs for the fieldwork itself, it's fairly simple to complete. The first two involve going to Europa and recovering lost items while laying waste to enemies inside a Lost Sector and completing world tasks. I don't mind any excuse to head back to the frozen moon of Jupiter, especially if I'm wielding what is essentially a frozen stake thrower.\n\nThe post Where is the Act 1 Fieldwork Tab in Destiny 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Emblems in Destiny 2 are a great way to stand out from the crowd and give other players a glimpse of what they're getting when you roll into the fireteam. For some, emblems are another thing to collect in a game where FOMO sweetens that chase. So, when the Life for Life emblem was shown off in 2022 with no way to obtain it, some were salivating. Here's how to get it.\n\n\nWhere to get the Life for Life Emblem in Destiny 2\n\n\nTwo years after its release, players can finally obtain the Life for Life emblem by visiting Master Rahool in The Tower. While you're there, make sure to visit the Special Deliveries Terminal for the following rewards (if you've purchased the season pass):\n\n\n\nArcology Vault Shell (Exotic Ghost Shell)\n\n\n(3) Ascendant Alloy\n\n\n(4) Ascendant Shard\n\n\n(1) Exotic Cipher\n\n\n(7) Upgrade Module\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Life for Life emblem was added in February 2022 with Season of the Risen. However, there was a small catch, as the emblem couldn't actually be obtained. Bungie would acknowledge this six months later in a TWAB. Two and a half years later, Bungie finally made good and included the Life for Life emblem.\n\n\nI'll admit that it took me a hot minute to figure out what the icon in the emblem was. Then I remembered when Crow accidentally killed one of Empress Caiatl's most trusted psions. Ah, good times. It's why Lord Saladin is now bound to the Cabal and goes by the moniker of Valus Forge. So, in a season where we're still cleaning up Uldren Sov's messes, it's humorous that we get a reminder of his reborn self's goofs.\n\nThe post How to get the Life for Life Emblem in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Harold Halibut and Judero are about to yield the limelight to The Spirit of the Samurai, confirmed with a December 12, 2024 launch date. Sharpen those swords and ready those warrior cats, folks. \n\n\nWait, warrior cats? That's right. If a harsh and violent samurai Metroidvania with stop-motion-style animation doesn't quite grab your attention (it really should), then know this: There are places where you get to play The Spirit of the Samurai as the viciously adorable warrior cat Chisai. The newest trailer for the game shows Chisai in action, along with its also-cute Kodama partner fighting a grotesque spider.\n\n\n\n\nThe Spirit of the Samurai hacks its way to a late 2024 release date\n\n\nWhen Chisai isn't being cute and potentially deadly, you will play as the samurai Takeshi, who ventures out to end the Oni rampage. Whereas Chisai is used during climbing and platforming sections, Takeshi must overcome the odds. He does it not by being adorable (sadly) but by killing yokai, Oni, and other demons of Japanese mythology using his katana, bow, and spear. \n\n\nThe Spirit of the Samurai is a dark and brutal Metroidvania. Its visuals, inspired by the works of famous animator Ray Harryhausen, are harsh and dreary but absolutely gorgeous. Watching the game in motion is a visual treat. If you haven't checked out the trailer yet, you really should. \n\n\nImage via Digital Mind Games and Kwalee \n\n\nBut you can also wait until next week and try the game out for yourself. A demo for The Spirit of the Samurai will launch on October 14, 2024, for the upcoming Steam Next Fest. I'm not sure what the demo covers, but it'll likely be an early section of the game. Hopefully, it includes some Chisai action. C'mon, you know what we want.\n\n\nThe Spirit of the Samurai launches on PC via Steam on December 12, 2024. \n\nThe post Stop-motion adventure The Spirit of the Samurai slices into a December launch date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "PowerWash Simulator lives in a niche all of its own, and it sure manages to dominate regardless. Over the past couple of years, FuturLab's surprisingly engaging wash 'em up has played host to all manner of wild DLC, but the new Shrek DLC may well top it all.\n\n\n\"Playtime is ogre,\" says FuturLab's latest Steam announcement. Featuring pixie-dust cleaners, faerie soap, and the good old-fashioned mops, PowerWash Simulator's new Shrek Special DLC pack takes players on a romp through a classic fantasy franchise. The gist of it all is still much the same, of course, but who could say no to an opportunity to power-wash Shrek's Swamp?\n\n\nImage via FuturLab\n\n\nClean up Shrek's swamp in PowerWash Simulator... for $7,99\n\n\nPriced at $7,99, Shrek Special is actually seemingly quite loaded with content. There are five maps to clean up in total:\n\n\n\nDuloc\n\n\nHansel's Honeymoon Hideaway\n\n\nShrek's Swamp\n\n\nFairy Godmother's Potion Factory\n\n\nDragon's Lair\n\n\n\nOf course, included is the aforementioned roster of magical cleaning tools and supplies, which puts this DLC at roughly the same ratio of content-per-dollar as all the other PowerWash Simulator DLCs. Content-wise, it seems pretty solid, but there are some problems to keep in mind for the time being.\n\n\nAs of October 10, the current build of the game will apparently lock up and make it impossible to do much of anything in-game if you try to actually clean up any of Shrek's unlikely mud palaces. Even entering menus becomes impossible, so it may pay off to wait until the developer can patch things up. FuturLab has historically been quite good with these matters, so it won't take long before the problems are properly sorted out.\n\n\nOnce that's all been sorted out, though, I've no doubt that Shrek Special will take its rightful place as a worthy alternative to the prior Warhammer 40K, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Tomb Raider DLCs, just to list a few.\n\nThe post De-Shrekify Shrek’s legendary swamp and cabin in new PowerWash Simulator DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While new weapons in Destiny 2 are the focus for most players, sometimes it's good to pick up some old tools of the trade. This is especially true with the launch of Episode: Revenant, where an old raid's weapons were updated to fit more modern standards.\n\n\nOne such weapon is highly sought-after by many players thanks to its strength when it was released. Titan players, especially, are hunting for it. Here's the god roll for the Prophet of Doom shotgun in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Prophet of Doom in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThe Prophet of Doom sports the Precision Frame archetype, causing its recoil to be far more vertical. This makes the shots easier to control, though that doesn't stop the recoil from being nasty. Thankfully, some of the news perks give us a way to fix that. The following perks do just that and more:\n\n\n\nBarrel: Rifled Barrel\n\n\nMagazine: Assault Mag\n\n\nPerk 1: Threat Detector\n\n\nPerk 2: Closing Time\n\n\n\nRifled Barrel brings that handling speed down but provides a healthy bonus to effective range, meaning you won't need to barrel stuff enemies as often. Assault Mag provides some stability to help with that recoil, alongside a healthy rate of fire boost. Threat Detector brings in some nice stability, faster reloads, and counteracts that lost handling if enemies are near you. With a shotgun, that isn't too difficult. Finally, we round things out with Closing Time, which improves the weapon's stats the more you empty the magazine. It's nothing crazy, but it sure helps.\n\n\nIf you're looking for some alternatives, Trench Barrel can be a good alternative for Closing Time if you're a Titan with a melee-focused build. Voltshot can also be good, provided you're in PvE and reload a bullet after every kill. Otherwise, the rest of this setup should be best in class.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Prophet of Doom god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As caught by Kotaku, you can already play the masterful remake of Silent Hill 2 without the series' ever-present and all-engulfing fog. Behold, the marvel:\n\n\nScreenshot via ThatGenericProEric\n\n\nThough Team Silent originally came up with it just to circumvent the PS1's hardware limitations, the fog present in Silent Hill ended up becoming the series' most iconic element. I'd argue it's even one of gaming's most iconic visual elements, overall. \n\n\nRemoving the fog from any of the Silent Hill games seems like shooting yourself in the foot with a bazooka, especially since the volumetric fog in the new Silent Hill 2 is one of the most amazing visual effects ever seen in a game. Still, FrancisLouis immediately set out to create a mod that rids the town of fog, and the results are surprisingly neat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game sure does lose a lot of what makes it special because the remake’s unique fog is incredible to look at, but it also hides a lot of the graphical prowess of the remake. Another interesting thing you might notice is how the game doesn't get less creepy, it just gets so in a different way. Silent Hill, in the state James visits it in, remains a desolate place filled with creepy crawlies and other inexplicable phenomena, and now they're all in plain sight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mod is called \"Silent Hill 2 HD Collection\", a cheeky reference to the Silent Hill 2 and 3 remasters from 2012 that accidentally did away with most of the games' fog. Those were absolutely awful, but I'm glad they paved the way for this kind of experimenting.\n\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this mod for a first playthrough, obviously. But, alongside the official no-UI mode and 90s filter, I think this is a pretty neat (and funny) way to experience SH2 and proof that the remake is more than just its spectacular environmental effects.\n\n\nYou can now enjoy Silent Hill 2 on PC and PS5.\n\nThe post New cheeky Silent Hill 2 mod removes all fog appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not only is the weapon the second-ever primary ammo grenade launcher, but it can spawn Special and Heavy ammo bricks for both you and your team.\n\n\nWith how solid the weapon is, you might be wondering whether there's a catalyst for it and how it changes its performance. There is a catalyst, but there's a massive caveat. Here's how to get the Alethonym exotic catalyst in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhen to get the Alethonym catalyst in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThe Alethonym's catalyst is unobtainable right now. Taking a look at the Season Pass, the catalyst is obtainable at rank 145, which doesn't unlock until Act II's launch. That won't be until the middle of November, so you'll need to wait until then to snag it. On the bright side, the catalyst is part of the free reward track.\n\n\nAs for what the catalyst will do once it's released, Bungie has remained tight-lipped on that front. If we had to wager a guess, it'll likely have something to do with generating Vestiges and building up the charge for that a bit faster. However, it could also be something to do with Stasis crystals or something like that. We're just speculating, though, so take those guesses with a grain of salt.\n\n\nIn the meantime, there are still plenty of other exotic goodies to collect.

The legal dispute was filed earlier this month by author Kelsey Martineau in Louisiana, alleging that many of the concepts and characters from Red War were \"directly\" taken from one of their science-fiction short stories.

Once you've enough of all the necessary resources, using the crafting recipe will help you obtain Vitalstones. To gain the resources, you'll have to track the movement pattern of a Gigantrite.\n\n\nHow to craft Vitalstones in Throne and Liberty\n\n\nThe first time you enter the game and clear the tutorial, you'll observe a Gigantrite. These gigantic creatures are like flying whales, and they drop something called blue crystals from their bodies. Usually, blue sparkles are the best hint, indicating the presence of these blue crystals.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nGigantrites are available on the mini-map, and they have specific spawn times. You can always check out the countdown timer to know when the next one is going to appear. Here are the ingredients needed to make Vitalstones.\n\n\n\nRare Manasteel\n\n\nRare Magic Powder\n\n\nPolished Crystals\n\n\nLithograph\n\n\n\nOnce you've enough resources, visit the Armor Crafter or Weapon Crafter, who will allow you access to the crafting menu.

You can change your selection later, and also upgrade the stones with proper resources.\n\nThe post Throne and Liberty: How to get Vitalstones appeared first on Destructoid.",

While discontinued, there was a whole slew of rewards you could earn each month for having Twitch/Amazon Prime including cosmetics and emotes.\n\n\nWith the launch of Episode: Revenant, Bungie is continuing that trend through a unique way to get a free shader. Here's how to get the Celestial Ties shader in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to get the Celestial Ties shader in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThe Celestial Ties shader is tied (pun absolutely intended) to a Discord quest. To complete this quest, you'll need to play Destiny 2 with Discord open for 15 minutes. After that, you'll get a code for the shader. To start this quest, click on the Discover button in the bottom left of your Discord client. This will show an array of quests, including the Destiny 2 Celestial Ties shader quest. Click Accept Quest, and a new banner will show in the bottom left with your progress. From here, simply play Destiny 2 for 15 minutes to complete the quest.\n\n\nOnce the quest is complete, you can click on the quest to get your code. This will be a nine-character code separated by three dashes. To claim it, head to Bungie.net/redeem, log in, and put in the code. Once that's done, all you need to do is head to the Tower in-game and head to the Special Deliveries terminal. This is found between Master Rahool and Banshee-44, before going down the hallway toward Ikora and where Xur would normally be. Under Additional Rewards in the terminal, you'll find your shader.\n\n\nHow to apply the Celestial Ties Shader\n\n\nTo apply the shader in-game, open up your Character screen, hover over the piece of gear you want the shader on, and open the details page. Head down to the Appearance page of that gear piece, then hover over the Shader slot and select the Celestial ties shader. This can be applied to any piece of legendary armor or any legendary weapon.\n\nThe post How to get the Celestial Ties shader in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Film má docela originální námět, ze kterého by mohlo vzniknout něco opravdu unikátního, kdyby měl lepší scénář, lepšího režiséra a lepší herce. Takhle je to 10 zajímavých minut na začátku, pak hodina nudy a pak 30 minut WTF, ve kterých už není možné nijak soucítit s nikým na plátně a bylo mi srdečně jedno, co se vlastně \"doopravdy\" stalo.

          "description": "110 minut docela kvalitního retra, které připomíná spíše \"Po strništi bos\" než cokoliv od Bohdana Slámy, a pak 20 minut něčeho zcela jiného, co je buď vrcholně originální nebo vrcholně nevydařené, ale v každém případě to pramálo navazuje na 110 předchozích minut. Znovu se ukazuje, že Sláma bravurně zvládá drobné situace, ale má problémy s dvouhodinovým, někam směřujícím dějem. Krobot je jako obvykle úžasný. (Ilča 60 %)",

          "description": "Skoro dokonalý horor. Nepředvídatelný, ale přesto celkem logický děj. Hutná atmosféra, tvořená novými permutacemi starých klišé, bez nutnosti uchylovat se k lekačkám a stříkající krvi. Nepotřebuji to vidět znovu, ale dlouho jsem něco tak kvalitního neviděl a nevšiml jsem si mnoha věcí, které by se daly zlepšit. (Ilča 80 %)",
