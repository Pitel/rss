          "description": "Tweet Racer.\nSquare Enix first boosted onto the kart racing scene all the way back in 1999 with the Final Fantasy-themed Chocobo Racing on the original PlayStation. A rather average effort all things told, the game featured a few unique ideas of its own — such as a selection of special moves to choose from pre-race and a cute pop-up book style story mode to introduce its cast of characters — but, when it came to the all-important racing action, it was let down by a combination of underwhelming tracks and a lack of precision in its controls.\nFast forward 23 years and you could perhaps forgive us, then, for being slightly underwhelmed by the prospect of returning to the world of Final Fantasy-inspired karting in Chocobo GP, a direct sequel to the forgettable original that's seen a rocky road to development. Having been announced way back in 2010 for the 3DS before being canned entirely in 2013 and then resurrected — if only in name and spirit — in the last couple of years.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We still have no voice chat, unless you want to subject yourself to the mobile app for a small number of games.

Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.\nThere's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing \"hahaha\" of old. And it makes me sad.\nRead more",

It's a \"playable short\" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.\nIn fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw). And it just reminds me how good Valve are at, you know, making games. Please, Valve, make more games.\nRead more",

This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.\nVix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time.

Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, \"You should do this thing.\" In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.\nRead more",

They are mysterious, to a degree, but they're also quite easy to read. Your innards? Their tea.\nBut what makes the game great is its capacity for surprise, the deep well of lore – the gaps left for us to fill. The goats. What's up with them, huh?

A Billy Idol concert. Yeah, you read that right. I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.\r\n\n\r\nThere is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.\nRead more",

Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions.

That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.\r\n\n\r\nWhile indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering.

And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset.

Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.\nValve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.\nRead more",

Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. \r\n\n\r\nSo it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It is very clearly similar to 2019’s Grid reboot, although there is immediately one thing that’s changed that makes this offering worth the upgrade. No, not the added story mode, it’s more fundamental than that; it’s the handling. It just didn’t feel quite right in the last game, whereas here it’s arguably the most playable handling system of any modern racer that doesn’t have ‘Kart’ in its title. Even though your car slides at every opportunity, it’s actually disguising the fact there’s a great deal of grip here, making for an enjoyable experience whatever your skill level.\nRead more",

As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's.

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 was an infuriating mess in so many ways when I reviewed it at the end of 2020, but a funny thing would happen every time I'd stop playing it. All the T-posed NPCs, floataway physics bugs and crashes-to-desktop would be lost in time, like tears in rain. What remained was the deep appreciation I had for its story and characters, and a longing to revisit Night City.\nSo I have. After last week's patch 1.5 promised more fixes, a refreshed perk tree and improved AI, I wondered if I might finally be able to champion the first-person RPG without caveats. The answer is not a simple yes or no - but the list of caveats is definitely a lot shorter.\nRead more",

I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence. But I understand it’s viewed as a faux-fancy chain for people who think Al Dente was the name of the man who invented spaghetti, and not somewhere you’d want to earnestly praise as a quote unquote ‘serious critic’.\r\n\n\r\nBig Tones was having none of it. He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews. A class act, no doubt. And it’s this championing of the everyman gourmand, this deep passion for non-exclusionary, unpretentious foodie culture, that powers Total War: Warhammer 3’s most joyfully silly campaign experience.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Jelikož FFmpeg již neposkytuje ffmpeg12vpdau, přechází MPlayer na samostatné ffmpeg1vpdau a ffmpeg2vpdau. Knihovna live555 je nyní zastaralou a ve výchozím nastavení deaktivovaná. GUI má opravenou chybnou velikost okna při návratu z fullscreenu, upraveno je rozpoznávání argumentu příkazové řádky -fs pro fullscreen vedle nastavení v GUI (předvolba load_fullscreen). MPlayer také konečně dostal vlastní výchozí GUI, takže není potřeba žádné vnější.",

A Reddit user may have found Gen 9 Easter eggs in not one but two recent Pokémon titles. \nIn a Reddit post, a user named DDD-HERO points out a clever hint hidden within a hotel in Pokémon Sword and Shield:\nThe image above, taken by DDD-HERO, shows said wallpaper adorned with grapes and oranges. Those two fruits can be found all over in the Scarlet and Violet reveal trailer, including two plaques flanking a doorway, each featuring an icon representing either an orange or a bushel of grapes.\nIt's a great find from this web sleuth, who also came up with another possible hint in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Seen below, there's a flowerbed in Twinleaf town filled with red and purple flowers, now recognized as the color pair for Scarlet and Violet. DDD-HERO made sure to check the original versions of Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, finding that the fenced garden initially existed but with less-pronounced flowers of different colors. I'd say this is another hit of a hint!\nNow to find one in Pokémon Legends: Arceus...\nCheck out the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right here, and find out which Pokémon are confirmed for the new duo of Switch titles so far.",

It pits you and one other player (if you’d like) against Spidersaurs, which are man-eating mutant spider dinosaurs, as the name implies. Originally designed in a lab to be meat and more for humans in need of supplies and resources, the Spidersaurs are loose and on a rampage against you and all of humanity. \nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nHowever, Spidersaurs on console and PC isn’t simply a port of the Apple Arcade version first released in 2019. It comes with some new things like an all-new stage, a new true final boss, a new ending, two new difficulty settings, and two new unlockable modes: Arcade mode and Speedrun mode. WayForward says other tweaks and balance adjustments have been made as well, including mid-level checkpoints, rebalanced boss order, and numerous visual improvements. If you’re happy playing Spidersaurs on Apple Arcade, don’t fret – it will receive these updates as well. \nSpidersaurs is currently available on Apple Arcade on iOS devices and it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime this spring. \nHave you played Spidersaurs?

I'm currently speeding through the content, but I was slow off the line, so I'm not quite ready to render my final verdict. However, from what I've played, Gran Turismo 7 is everything players should want from a simulation racer. \nMy first impression was just how flat-out gorgeous this game is. Yes, racing games typically are visual showcases, but Gran Turismo 7 is impressive even in a genre that includes the likes of Forza Horizon 5. Each vehicle, track, and environment is meticulously modeled, giving you a true sense of immersion as you drive at blistering speeds. Around every turn, the beauty of Polyphony Digital's work is unavoidable.\nUnlike Forza Horizon 5, Gran Turismo 7 is a sim racer that takes place on closed tracks. That means you won't be exploring a vast, open world or launching yourself off ramps, but there is plenty of fun to be had. Whether you're competing in white-knuckled races over the course of several laps, completing activities to satisfy special missions, or racking up mileage in special time trials set to musical playlists, Gran Turismo 7 offers a diverse set of content. Not only that, but it appeals heavily to the collector in me, continually encouraging me to build as robust a garage of vehicles as I can.\nGran Turismo 3: A-Spec captivated me more than two decades ago and was perhaps the most-played game on my PlayStation 2. The series hasn't held my attention to that extent in the time since, but even in my early stages, I can feel Gran Turismo 7 begin to sink its hooks in me. Only time will tell if this game will steal hours upon hours from me the way Gran Turismo 3 did, but so far, I'm having a great time with the latest from Polyphony Digital.",

Yes, that’s a fire axe that Sharice is wielding, so the undead are in serious trouble. The potentially much bigger news is that a new PvE experience is also coming with this update, the ridden hives. Of course, there are all kinds of new loot to be had as well, so that should have cleaners crawling back to camp to take on these new threats. Warped chests, new cards, and legendary weapons are all on deck to help fight back against the undead tide.\nThe Tunnels of Terror is scheduled to land on April 12 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

Capcom doesn’t specify what that means but one would assume the games will hit at least 60 fps since that’s the benchmark for current-gen titles. The PS5 versions feature Dual Sense haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support as well. \nBest of all, if you already own these games on last-gen consoles you’ll get a free upgrade to the new versions (with Smart Delivery on Xbox). A free upgrade patch is also coming to the PC versions. There’s no release date for these re-releases but expect them in 2022. \nResident Evil 7 Biohazard launched in 2017 and was hailed as a return to form for the series, shifting the perspective to first-person and getting back to the franchise’s survival horror roots. Its direct sequel, Resident Evil Village, arrived in 2021. The remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 were similarly celebrated as smart reimaginings of the PS1 classics, reinventing them using Resident Evil 4’s over-the-shoulder gameplay. \nTo learn more, be sure to check out our reviews for each title:\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard Review\nResident Evil 2 Review\nResident Evil 3 Review",

          "description": "After purchasing the anime streaming service, Crunchyroll, last year, Sony Pictures Entertainment is shifting its other anime-focused service, Funimation, and all of its content under the Crunchyroll banner.\nEffective immediately, Crunchyroll is now the home to an even more massive library of anime titles including many English dubs that previously were produced by and presented by Funimation. A full list can be found on the Crunchyroll site, but here are some of the shows now available for Crunchyroll viewers:\nAttack on Titan: Junior High (Sub and Dub)\nBlack Clover ep. 1–170 (Dub)\nCowboy Bebop (Sub and Dub)\nDarling in the Franxx (Dub)\nDr. Stone seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)\nFire Force seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)\nFruits Basket seasons 1-3 (Dub)\nHunter x Hunter ep. 1–74 (Dub)\nMy Hero Academia seasons 1–5 (Dub)\nScarlet Nexus (Dub)\nSk8 the Infinity (Sub and Dub)\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime seasons 1 and 2 and OADs (Dub)\nTokyo Ghoul (Dub)\nYu Yu Hakusho ep. 1-112 and OVAs (Sub and Dub)\nYuri!!! on Ice (Dub)\nStarting with the upcoming spring season for anime, Crunchyroll will be the place to catch subs and dubs of any new anime for both Sony-owned streamers. Funimation users will only be able to watch new episodes of series already existing on the Funimation service, so now is definitely the time to migrate over to Crunchyroll. To encourage the switch and ease the transition, Funimation subscribers will be receiving an email with an offer for 60 days of a premium Crunchyroll subscription for free. \nCrunchyroll recently became one of four streaming apps available on the Nintendo Switch, and with this consolidation, renders Funimation's Switch app obsolete, bringing the count ostensibly back down to three.",

The good news is Disney is making room on its streaming service for all of the MCU-related TV shows.\nThe countdown is on. Marvel's Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, The Punisher, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. start streaming March 16 on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/U80cfZCPa8\nMarch 1, 2022\nStarting on March 16, Disney+ will be the exclusive place to watch every season of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Punisher, The Defenders, and even former ABC series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. which was conspicuously missing from the Marvel lineup. Those shows will join the already accessible Agent Carter on Disney+ that weren't natively made for the service, nor strictly tied to the current Marvel Cinematic Universe storylines. However, the Netflix roster, which has always been part of the MCU canon, has only recently started to be more directly referenced in the newer movies/Disney+ shows so bringing them home makes more sense than ever. \nDisney and Marvel haven't said whether the series migrating to Disney+ will receive any additional seasons, specials, or even films, but with all of these shows hitting the mothership streaming service certainly leaves some doors open. As for the saucier nature of the former Netflix series (these aren't fun family-friendly romps), United States subscribers to Disney+ will see some \"updated parental controls\" landing alongside the shows. Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand will also have access to these shows on March 16.",

This feature adds tasks that, when completed, will shell out a handful of My Nintendo Platinum Points upon completion. Missions to complete include backing up a save to the cloud or booting up Super Mario Bros. in the Switch Online NES collection or other ways to make sure you're exploring everything you can do with your online subscription. To view these missions, simply head to the Nintendo Switch Online app on the Switch's home screen.\nSince the rewards available use the already existing Platinum Points, you may already have a pile of coins stashed away to redeem on a host of new digital items like new icon elements. These elements are character photos, frames, and backgrounds used to build and customize an icon image for your Switch profile. Right now, Switch Online users can pay Platinum Points for Animal Crossing and Mario Odyssey-themed icon parts, with a fresh set of icon elements becoming available each month.

And now, following yesterday's reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, we'll be diving headfirst into Generation 9 later this year on the Switch. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nA new generation of Pokémon is exciting for a number of reasons. There's the new story to unravel, a brand-new region to explore, and of course, new Pokémon to catch. Perhaps more exciting than all of that, though, are the three starter Pokémon that we'll be beginning our new Scarlet and Violet adventures with. It's the first big decision we'll all be making in Generation 9, other than choosing which version to play in the first place, and it's one that will stick with us for the entire duration (unless you're a heathen who doesn't use their starter on their journey to the Elite Four). \nAs expected, there are three starters to choose from: The Grass-type cat Sprigatito, the Fire-type croc Fuecoco, and the Water-type duckling Quaxly. \nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nFor me, I'm going with Quaxly. It's not my favorite design of the group, to be honest, but since Generation 1, I've always chosen the Water-type starter (except in Sword and Shield because goodness, I loathed the design of Inteleon). I like Quaxly's design enough that I'll be able to return to my old habits, and that's exciting. I have to say, though – Fuecoco's giving me big Totodile vibes and Totodile is an all-time great starter. Sprigatito is a cat, though, and who doesn't love a good cat Pokémon? \nWith all of that in mind, we want to know: which starter Pokémon are you choosing in Scarlet or Violet?

You’ll be tasked with beginning an investigation into a new phenomenon that is causing a mass outbreak of what appear to be Alpha Pokémon.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the phenomenon is causing some of the most challenging types of Pokémon in the game to appear all over the place and it seems it will be up to you to figure out first what’s going on, and then discover a way to stop it. It’s not a bad time to be catching some powerful Pokémon if you’re up to the challenge, though. \nThe Daybreak update will also bring new Pokémon battles to the training grounds in-game. Seemingly addressing one of players’ biggest complaints, this new update will make it so that there are more Pokémon battles against other trainers to take part in. As for how many or how often, who knows but fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to find out because the Daybreak update hits Pokémon Legends: Arceus later today. \nTo coincide with Pokémon Day, players who use the password \"ARCEUSADVENTURE\" in-game will receive 30 Ultra Balls, 30 Gigaton Balls, and 30 Jet Balls. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about Generation 9, which was just revealed today as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. \nAre you excited about the Daybreak update?

After the success of Uncharted 2 and it's blockbuster setpieces, Naughty Dog upped the stakes and pushed to include even more spectacular action moments. Unfortunately, that put a toll on development. In this episode, we talk about Uncharted 3's renewed focus on melee combat, how Last of Us' development impacted the team, and why Uncharted 3 almost shipped with a game-breaking bug. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and co-founder and the CEO of Kinda Funny Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's third outing.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

The device can’t play every title and Steam recently rolled out new library categories to better label which of your games work on the Deck and which don’t. Publisher THQ Nordic has assisted on this front by revealing which of its many titles are playable on Steam Deck at launch.  \nIn a press release, THQ has listed the following titles as Steam Deck Verified. That means they’re fully functional on the handheld:\nDarksiders II Deathinitive Edition\nDarksiders Genesis\nDesperados III\nThis is the Police 2\nThe next batch of titles is Steam Deck Playable. This is a step below Verified status because while these games work on the device, they may require some manual tweaking to get them running at full capacity:\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar\nBiomutant\nDarksiders: Warmastered Edition\nDestroy All Humans! (2020)\nElex\nExpeditions: Rome\nMX vs ATV All Out\nSpongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated\nThis is the Police\nThere are currently over 300 titles confirmed to be playable on Steam Deck and that number will grow as Valve and developers work to get games running on the handheld. Other confirmed titles include Persona 4, Dota 2, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Inscryption, and Valheim. \nAre you getting your hands on a Steam Deck today? Let us know in the comments!",

When Google removes an allegedly copyright-infringing URL from its search engine,  it will disable ads on this URL as well. In addition, the search engine has added a “still-in-theaters/prerelease” tag for DMCA notices, so reported sites can be punished more severely.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
