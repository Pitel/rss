          "description": "Top 40 is chock full of Switch games.\nWell folks, in what is presumably the last Christmas period before Nintendo unleashes its next major hardware, Switch games have performed admirably as folks look to fill those stockings come Wednesday morning.\nIn fact, let's look at the numbers here: 8 games in the top 10 are either Switch exclusive or can be played on the Switch, and the same can be said of 26 titles from the complete top 40 charts. That's impressive, and it goes to show just how popular boxed Switch games really are at this time of year.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A genuine blast.\nA few months ago, the Switch finally received Pizza Tower, an indie action platformer that’s gotten a lot of praise for how well it channels Nintendo’s long-dormant Wario Land series. Yet developer Tour de Pizza wasn’t the only team inspired by Wario. Summitsphere’s Antonblast is a wild and wonderful action platformer that feels like it could actually be the next Wario Land game if it came with a different coat of paint; its combination of speed, precision, and smart level design makes for a truly thrilling experience that’s only let down by its issues with stable performance.\nAntonblast stars the titular Dynamite Anton, whose angry, red-skinned appearance leaves Satan feeling envious and insecure about his status as “the reddest being of them all.” So, in a petty act of retaliation, he sends his minions to Anton’s apartment to steal what he cherishes most: the Spirits that he kept around his living space. Enraged, Anton grabs his hammer and sets out on a quest to reclaim what was stolen and to give Satan a piece of his mind.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy.

          "description": "Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. \nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.\r\n\nCuriosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Among my last-resort tactics for generating precious PC gaming news is to go on holiday - for as sure as toast lands buttered side down while cats always land on their feet, as sure as the number 13 breeds calamity and Star Citizen committing to a release date guarantees a delay, myself going on holiday will always, somehow, conjure a big story from the crevices. It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a \"bogus\" phishing report, sent by \"AI-powered\" brand protection software.\nThe situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires.

          "description": "If you've started to complete the new schematics of the Palworld Feybreak update, you'll find the requirement for a certain resource called Hexolite to make them.\n\n\nThis unique metal is exclusively available from the Feybreak region, but not in the way you might think. Unlike Chromite, you can't directly farm Hexolite. The trick is to farm the three ingredients required to produce Hexolite, and that process will be necessary if you want to keep building the schematics.\n\n\nHow to make Hexolite in Palworld\n\n\nTo make Hexolite, you'll need the following resources in the mentioned quantities.\n\n\n\nChromite x5\n\n\nHexolite Quartz x12\n\n\nOre x20\n\n\n\nOre is an old resource which can be found all over the map. For Chromite and Hexolite Quartz, you'll have to travel to Feybreak Island. Check this guide out to efficiently farm Chromite after reaching the island. For Hexolite Quartz, you can use your pickaxe on the nodes that can be found all around the island.\n\n\nHexolite Quartz nodes are really bright and stand out, and you can find them on the beach. Once you have the required ingredients, Hexolite can be made at the Blast Furnace. Make sure to have your Technology at level 56 or higher to unlock the production procedure.\n\n\n\n\nAll Hexolite recipes in Palworld\n\n\nHexolite is required to craft several new items in the Feybreak update. These include:\n\n\n\nExotic Sphere\n\n\nBeam Sword\n\n\nAdvanced Bow (multiple types)\n\n\nLaser Gatling Gun (multiple types)\n\n\nPlasma Cannon (multiple types)\n\n\nHexolite Armor (multiple types)\n\n\nHeat Resistant Hexolite Armor (multiple types)\n\n\nCold Resistant Hexolite Armor (multiple types)\n\n\nLightweight Hexolite Armor (multiple types)\n\n\nHexolite Helmet (multiple types)\n\n\nTriple Jump Boots\n\n\nAdvanced Arrow\n\n\nPlasma Cartridge\n\n\nAdvanced Shield\n\n\nSilvegis Saddle\n\n\nBastigor's Hammer\n\n\nAdvanced Sphere Assembly Line\n\n\nLarg-Scale Electric Egg Incubator\n\n\nMedicine Facility\n\n\nPal Pod\n\n\nAdvanced Chest.\n\n\nThe post Best way to farm Hexolite in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

But first, you'll have to reach the island in order to discover what lies there, and that can be slightly confusing.\n\n\nSo here's how to find Feybreak Island in Palworld.\n\n\nPalworld Feybreak Island location explained\n\n\nThe Feybreak island is located in the south-west part of the main map. If you've traveled to Mount Obsidian, the new island is next to it, with the coordinates being -700 and -890. There are different ways to get there, but the most efficient will be from Fisherman's Point.\n\n\nTo travel over there, you can either use a flying Pal or a Pal who can swim. The first task you'll want to do is to activate the Scorched Ashland waypoint at coordinates -810 and -826, as it will activate fast travel to Feybreak Island.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you're taking the aerial route, the island has anti-air weapons in place. This means that you and your pal will be shot down if you continue approaching the island by air. One good strategy is to get close to the island and then just swim. If you find that your stamina isn't enough, just get on top of your pal and get down immediately.\n\n\nThe easier alternative is to use a Pal that can swim, as you won't have to care about the defensive mechanisms. Once you reach the island, you'll be able to explore it and get new resources like Chromite. However, be careful of your player level (like don't do what I did), and make sure you're above Level 50 if you don't want to worry too much about the Pals or enemies that you might encounter.\n\nThe post How to reach Feybreak island in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Palworld's Feybreak update has added plenty of new content, and you can complete bounties to unlock different rewards to aid your in-game journey.\n\n\nThe Feybreak expansion is now live across all platforms, and bounties are an interesting addition. They can be considered side quests that you can engage in in your free time, and completing them will earn you rewards. These simple activities can also be done routinely, allowing you to gain more resources in the process.\n\n\nHow to start a bounty in Palworld\n\n\nTo begin a bounty in Palworld, you'll need to speak with Intel Dealers. These dealers can be found all around the island, and you can look for them in settlements. You can also find them beside the fast travel locations, so knowing where they are is the easy part. Once you interact with them, you'll get the description of Bounty Targets that are available in the area.\n\n\n\n\nHow to complete a bounty in Palworld\n\n\nOnce you've got the details about a Bounty Target, you'll need to track them down. Then, you can either capture them or defeat them. The choice is entirely yours, although defeating them might be useful. Once you defeat/capture a Bounty Target, they will drop something called Bounty Tokens. This is the main resource you can earn by completing bounties in Palworld.\n\n\nOnce you've found some Bounty Tokens, look for the Vigilante Bounty Officer npc. You can usually find them in settlements, and they will provide you with different rewards in exchange for these tokens.\n\n\nIf you undertake a harder bounty, you'll need to track and defeat different bosses. They will reward you with boss bounty tokens, which are special resources required to access dungeons. These dungeons are mostly related to endgame content, so you can avoid them for the time being if you're a beginner. All things considered, bounties in Palworld can be an excellent source of farming certain items, but it can feel slightly repetitive after a while. \n\nThe post What to do with bounties in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dead Space fans, look away now. Series creator Glen Schofield has revealed that EA recently rejected a pitch from him and two other developers who worked on the original game for a potential Dead Space 4. \n\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that the Dead Space series had been put on ice at EA after Motive's 2023 remake of the original game did not meet the publisher's expectations. This was despite positive reviews, with many believing the game to be an improvement on the 2008 survival-horror classic. However, it seems this may be the last we see of the series for some time.\n\n\nImage via EA\n\n\nGlen Schofield's Dead Space 4 pitch was recently rejected\n\n\nGlen Schofield, creator and director of the original game, revealed in an interview with Dan Allen Gaming that he had pitched a potential Dead Space 4 to EA this year, alongside creative director Bret Robbins and animation director Christopher Stone. \n\n\n\"We didn't go too deep - they just said no, we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and you know, we know who to talk to, so we didn’t take it any further... they know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that,\" Schofield explained.\n\n\n\n\nStone jumped in to attempt to explain EA's decision further, claiming, \"The industry is in a weird place right now. People are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you’ve got to you know, take it with a grain of salt, who knows, maybe one day, I think we’d all love to do it.\" \n\n\nWhile Dead Space might not be in EA's immediate plans, it will be interesting to see if the publisher returns to it in the future. Even more curious will be to see if it returns to Schofield to explore his plans further. He wasn't involved in the series beyond the original game, but could be just what it needs for some original ideas.\n\nThe post EA recently rejected a Dead Space 4 pitch from series creator appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The launch of the Feybreak update has introduced the Meowmere weapon in Palworld, which is part of the game's collab with Terraria.\n\n\nThe new weapon is perhaps the most unique addition to the latest update, as it's primarily a melee weapon. However, the weapon can also fire bullets, making it a gun as well. The flexible nature of the weapon and its exclusive nature being part of a collab make it a popular choice for all. Hence, let's take a look at how you can build this weapon and wield it in Palworld's newest update.\n\n\nAll Meowmere ingredients in Palworld\n\n\nTo craft the Meowmere, you must be at Technology Level 30 to access the schematic.

They drop from Predator Pals, who spawn all over the map. Their spawn location doesn't show on the map, which makes it hard for you to detect and defeat them. Typically, Predator Pals will have a red glow about them, indicating their special nature.\n\n\nThese Rampaging pals will have more moves and a higher health pool, making it hard for you to take them down. You can check this guide out to learn more about Predator Cores and how to find them.\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Meowmere in Palworld\n\n\nOnce you have all the required resources, you can use any of the following benches to craft your own Meowmere.\n\n\n\nHigh Quality Workbench\n\n\nProduction Assembly Line\n\n\nProduction Assembly Line II\n\n\nWeapon Workbench\n\n\nWeapon Assembly Line\n\n\nWeapon Assembly Line II\n\n\n\nThis special sword has 200 attack, takes up 22 units of your inventory space, and comes with high durability as well.

          "description": "Remember all those years ago when we first got a glimpse of Skyrim? My word, but it was gorgeous. Jaw-dropping vistas of the colder parts of Tamriel were something to behold. Fast-forward some 13 years later and vanilla TES5 has certainly aged to some extent. But there's still life in the ol' girl, yet.\n\n\nAs noted by DSO Gaming, someone has created a version of Skyrim with a graphical kiss of life, so to speak. Specifically, someone has ported the game over to Unreal Engine 5, and you can now play the demo of this fan project.\n\n\n\n\nThe video above gives a taste of how much it's improved the overall look of Bethesda's aging RPG. The person responsible for the port – one Greg Coulthard – says they wrote their own C++ plugin, which allows it to read the ESM files of Skyrim, which also automates \"landscape generation and object placement\" within UE5. You can download the demo from Discord here. Just look for the link pinned to the top of the \"bethesda_unreal\" channel.\n\n\nJust a lovely stroll through the world\n\n\nA couple of things to note: first, Coulthard says their version uses the vanilla assets of Skyrim, so it will still look very close to the 2011 release, just with much better visuals. Second, DSO notes that the demo only contains the world, so there's no gameplay or RPG mechanics to speak of.\n\n\nBasically, if you just want to have a leisurely walk through Skyrim's land, wondering what could have been had Bethesda built the game in Unreal Engine, this is your chance. As for when we will have a full release of the project, it's hard to say at this stage. For all we know, it may never emerge.\n\n\nEssentially, go into this with an understanding that it's more of a proof of concept than an example of things to come. But, hey, it's at least another way for Skyrim to retain some degree of relevance while we wait ever longer for updates on The Elder Scrolls 6.\n\nThe post Skyrim has been ported to Unreal Engine 5, and it’s stunningly beautiful appeared first on Destructoid.",

The humongous 110-gig update 1.1.0 revamped almost every aspect of the game, featuring over 1,800 fixes and improvements in total.
