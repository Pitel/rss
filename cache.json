          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.\nAlso, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\".

          "description": "I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.\nRead more",

          "description": "While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say \"his own choomba shot him!\" for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.\nRead more",

Unfortunately, the ingredients take a long while to grow. \n\n\nAll Tekka Maki Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTekka Maki can be made with the following ingredients in Disney Dreamlight Valley: \n\n\n\nTuna\n\n\nSeaweed\n\n\nSoya\n\n\nRice\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nTuna can be fished from the waters of Glade of Trust and Forgotten Lands in the original valley. The ingredient can be found in white ripples within the water. \n\n\nSeaweed can be found in a similar spot to Tuna. Use your fishing rod and set the feed to a place outside of ripples within any spot in the Valley. You should get Seaweed pretty quickly. This ingredient is also used to feed turtles in Disney Dreamlight Valley. \n\n\nSoya can be purchased from Goofy's Stall in the Lion King-themed Sunlit Plateau. The clumsy character sells the green beans' seeds for 60 Star Coins. It annoyingly grows within one hour and 30 minutes. You can speed up the process with some Miracle Growth Elixir. \n\n\nRice is also bought from Goofy's Stall, this time in the Glade of Trust. The seeds are 35 Star Coins each, while the ingredient itself is 92 Star Coins each.  Rice is a little quicker to grow than Soya and takes 50 minutes. Rice can also be used to make another Japanese dish, Sake Maki, which includes Salmon instead of Tuna.\n\n\nOnce you have all the ingredients, go to a cooking station at your home or Chez Remy. Then, place them all into the pot to create your Tekka Maki. It can be sold for 366 Star Coins or consumed for 984 Energy. Now, you have the delicious recipe in your culinary repertoire! \n\nThe post How to make Tekka Maki in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you want to make your build in Jujutsu Infinite as powerful as possible, you'll want to concentrate on getting Energy Nature.\n\n\nUnlike typical resources, there's no direct explanation about Energy Nature inside the game. Additionally, you can't get Energy Nature directly, and you'll have to concentrate on the resources used to create this resource.\n\n\nHow to farm Energy Nature in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nYou'll need to collect an Energy Nature Scroll to get an Energy Nature, but this won't be an easy task. The Energy Nature Scroll is a Lvl. 300 Special Grade item. To get Energy Nature, you'll have to use an Energy Nature Scroll.\n\n\nWhen you use a scroll for the first time, you'll get one Energy Nature, and you can use only one at any given moment. Using a scroll with one equipped will allow you to reroll your existing choice for a different one.\n\n\nThere are two ways of getting Energy Nature Scrolls. You can find them from chests, but the rate of obtaining one is very low. You can use consumables to improve the chances of finding one, and using Beckoning Cats or Lotuses with Fortune Gourd will be helpful.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAnother way of obtaining a scroll is by trading in the Curse Market, and you can do so mostly with the help of Domain Shards and Maximum Scrolls. Ultimately, it's pretty complex to get the scrolls in the first place as you'll have to rank up your character to level 300 or more. \n\n\nAgain, not every Energy Nature is the same, and you can check out this tier list to get the best option for your build. Ultimately, their effectiveness depends on the style of play of your character, and you should pay attention to that particular aspect as well.\n\nThe post How to get Energy Nature in Jujutsu Infinite appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the resource is part of the Yuki Fortress daily quest, there doesn't appear to be any known method to obtain it. Let's take a look at whether you can get this item right now inside the game.\n\n\nHow to get Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nAt the time of writing, there's no way to obtain Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite. Naturally, this means the Yuki Fortress daily quest can't be solved, as you'll need this specific resource to do so. In all probability, this might be a bug, and the developers are likely to be working on it to solve the situation.\n\n\nIncidentally, you can find this resource in the Sandbox version, where Frost Petals shares the same icon as Cursebloom, a common material required to craft different consumables. This might be a good indication of how you'll be able to use Frost Petals eventually when they're properly added to the game.\n\n\n\n\nThen again, you can already find the description for the resource, meaning they're in core game files. All the available evidence suggests that the developers might have locked Frost Petals for the time being so that players can't obtain it. But that's likely to be resolved soon.\n\n\nOnce Frost Petals can be obtained inside the game, we will update this section to help you get this valuable item. If you're just getting started, the first task will be to farm as many spins as possible. Make sure to check out our guide on that topic, which will allow you to make your gameplay journey a lot easier.\n\nThe post Can you get Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
