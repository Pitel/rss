          "description": "Legends never die.\nLast month, Riot Games announced a substantial number of layoffs within the company, and one of the casualties was the Riot Forge publishing arm. Over the last few years, Riot Forge partnered with various indie developers to produce a diverse lineup of single-player games set in the world of Runeterra, and these games all proved to be pretty good while being completely different from each other. Presumably, whatever projects it had in the works for the rest of this year have all been cancelled, making the latest release—a cozy RPG called Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story—the last hurrah of Riot Forge. Bandle Tale offers a decent, enjoyable take on a Stardew Valley-esque life sim, and though it has its issues, it feels like a good send-off for one of Riot’s most interesting initiatives.\nBandle Tale is set in the mystical realm of Bandle City, which is linked to the expansive land of Runeterra via magical portals. You play the role of a humble yordle living with their grandpa in the quiet region of Yarnville, which is mostly disconnected from other yordle settlements. Events kick off when you sneak out with your best friend to attend a party, where you inadvertently cause an enormous magical incident with a nearby portal that destroys the entire portal network and throws the entirety of Bandle City into disarray. Luckily, your character has been training for the past century in a magical form of knitting, so they set out to repair the damage done to the portal network and explore the other yordle settlements that they never got to see.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Debuting back in 1995 as the second entry in the Mystery Dungeon series, Mystery Dungeon 2: Shiren the Wanderer introduced the world to the young boy who would explore many procedurally-generated dungeons over the next few decades.\nAmazingly, despite being such a long-running franchise, there are actually only five mainline games in the series, and twelve in total (counting mobile games and spin-offs), but Shiren has a loyal following. In the West, we were oblivious to these endless tower-climbing, dungeon-trawling adventures until 2008's punishingly difficult Wii title, Shiren the Wanderer.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

France-based Holy Cap Studios and Red Art Games bring us this 2D puzzle-platformer collectathon that connects a mix of lands via a Great Elevator. Inspired by other titles, it may not be the most original, but true to its name (French for ‘ride’), it’s a pleasure to play — for the most part.\nPromenade opens with your character, Nemo, getting lost (don’t). He’s less the Pixar fish and more Finn the Human. You fall from a great height to somewhere underground, where a little ‘poulp’ (which we just learned is another word for octopus, from the French poulpe) saves your life. A wholesome montage shows you making a home, before the day you decide to embark on the big wide world together.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days.

A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.\nRead more",

Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is \"cautious\" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.\r\n \nRead more",

In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  \nComposed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.\nThe boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.\nThis might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.\nRead more",

After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.\nBut nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.\nWhile Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.\n Read more",

The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs.

          "description": "If you've been yearning to take up arms against Super Earth as either an arachnid, a robot or a filthy (managed) democracy-hating human traitor, then I have bad news, roughneck. Helldivers 2 will \"never\" get a PvP mode, according to Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt. The reason? They want to avoid encouraging any toxic behaviour in the new shooter's multiplayer community.\nGiven that Helldivers 2 is a game with mandatory friendly fire in which you can kill team-mates by respawning right on top of them, I fear the Good Ship Camaraderie may already have sailed, but I'm very early on in my Helldiver career, and I'm... intrigued by how Arrowhead's efforts at community curation sit alongside/within the game's premise of playing a dirty space fascist locked in an endless xenophobic crusade.\n Read more",

It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic!

But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.\nWith so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore?

As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment). Seriousness is reserved for the act of extermination, which adds tactility to the familiar motions of a shooter, making for horde management that promotes efficiency and frequent lapses of judgement in equal measure. Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.\nRead more",

          "description": "MojeFedora.cz informuje, že ovladač Nvidia už není v GNOME Software. Před 7 lety se zjednodušil způsob, jak nainstalovat proprietární ovladače Nvidia do Fedory. Pokud jste po instalaci souhlasili s repozitáři třetích stran, přidal se speciální repozitář z RPMFusion, který balíčky s ovladačem obsahoval. Zároveň byla přidána integrace s GNOME Software, takže stačilo dát hledat v katalogu softwaru \"nvidia\" a ovladač šlo nainstalovat několika kliknutími.\r\n\r\nNyní se od tohoto řešení ustoupilo. Ovladač v RPMFusion totiž není podepsaný klíčem Fedory a tudíž nefunguje se SecureBootem, který má dnes zapnutý většina počítačů. Zmizela pouze integrace s GNOME Software, kde už nyní ovladač nenajdete. Repozitář s ovladačem je stále k dispozici a lze ho doinstalovat přes DNF. Uživatelů, kteří ovladač už nainstalovaný mají, by se to nemělo nijak dotknout. Momentálně se hledá nové řešení, které by bylo jednoduché a zároveň fungovalo se SecureBootem.",

Busy day.\n\n\n\n\nIt was about a year ago that we first heard that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was on its way. We still don’t really know much about what is going to be in it and how it will build on the 2022 megahit, but that’s what makes this announcement about an announcement so anticipated. It’s been nearly two years since the game first launched, so it’s expected to be rather extensive. We’ll have a better idea sometime tomorrow.\n\n\nI never did finish Elden Ring. I guess I’ll soon know if I should hold off or if I need to pick it back up again before the expansion launches.\n\n\nThe trailer is set to be three minutes long, so it’s not going to be an in-depth look, but hopefully, we’ll get a good look at things.\n\n\nThe trailer fo Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to go live at 7am PST, 10am EST on February 21, 2024.\n\nThe post Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is getting a gameplay trailer tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ubisoft and Netflix have announced that Rainbow Six SMOL, the spin-off of the venerable Tom Clancy sub-series, is now available on Android and iOS.\n\n\nRainbow Six SMOL takes the once realism-focused tactical FPS series and shrinks it down to cartoon-ish proportions. You command a squad of counterterrorists as they march around procedurally generated stages, blasting everything in sight. The press release suggests that you can take a sneak approach, but there are a lot of explosions in the trailer that suggest that’s unlikely.\n\n\n\n\nI used to love Rainbow Six back in its pre-Ubisoft days. Even following Red Storm’s acquisition, I frequently returned to it straight up through its bastardization in the Rainbow Six Vegas games. I fell off that after Ubisoft did what Ubisoft does and sucked a lot of the color out of the games, which is weird to say about tactical shooters.\n\n\nRainbow Six SMOL, however, actually looks like it could be fun. The trailer shows off a good flow of action and demonstrates some of its features, like a fog of war that obscures everything your characters can’t see at the moment. It still looks like a far cry from its tactical roots, but it doesn’t look like it completely excludes its DNA. I think it’s a bit troubling to depict something like counterterrorism with such cartoonish glee. That's some dystopian territory we walked into, but that’s video games for you.\n\n\nSeriously, though, I’m typically allergic to mobile games, but this looks like something I want to try. The press release says that it’s available exclusively to Netflix members, so it might be worth a shot. Assuming I don’t just forget about it moments after posting this article, which is always a risk.\n\n\nRainbow Six SMOL is available now for Android and iOS exclusively for Netflix members.\n\nThe post Rainbow Six SMOL is a bite-sized operation, out now for mobile appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will be joined this month by the adorable Bluey: The Videogame, Indivisible, and Space Engineers among other titles, according to Xbox Wire.\n\n\nTales of Arise can now be played by Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC. It also works on the cloud through the Xbox app on your phone. It's a well-regarded JRPG marked as a return to form for the long-running Tales of series. It's also on PlayStation Plus through the Extra and Premium Game Catalog options this month, too.\n\n\nIn our review, Eric Van Allen wrote: \"Whether this is the big Tales breakthrough or not is a matter that history will decide. This is a Tales game that hits the right spots for me, puts a lot of love into its cast and its action, and somehow manages to strike a balance between the old and the new. It’s not without a few shortcomings, but it’s also got a lot of improvements that at least shore those up a bit.\"\n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nIf you're not a big JRPG fan, you're in luck because there are many February and March Xbox Game Pass titles to look forward to. They include Return to Grace, Bluey: The Videogame on February 22, Maneater (which is returning on February 27), Madden NFL 24 for cloud services on February 27, underrated RPG Indivisible on February 28, and Space Engineers on February 29.\n\n\nThe Doom-like FPS game Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun also demolishes its way to Xbox Game Pass on March 5. Another huge game Diablo IV slithers its way to Xbox Game Pass on March 28.

          "description": "Tinybuild has announced Road Redemption developer Redemption Road Games’ Kingmakers, which takes medieval battle simulation and perverts it with modern firepower. I can dig it.\n\n\nThe trailer’s pretty awesome, misdirecting with some shots of gameplay that could be torn out of any number of medieval RTS. Then, it cuts to someone driving a pickup truck through the battle, and it gets weirder from there.\n\n\n\n\nYou play as someone from the future who gets sent back in time to intervene in a war. You’re trying to prevent the apocalypse and simultaneously confuse archeologists by leaving bullet casings on battlefields. But beyond just enjoying a vast technological advantage, you also get to lead your troops, popping out of third-person combat to an overhead RTS viewpoint. You also plop down buildings, but judging by the guys running around during this sequence in the trailer, it looks more like Command & Conquer basebuilding than metagame citybuilding.\n\n\nBlasting knights with modern firepower isn’t really anything new, but somehow, it isn’t very pervasive (yet). It’s an appealing concept. It was always very satisfying in the Civilization series to have a vast technological superiority and roll tanks over their archers.\n\n\nKingmakers also features co-op for anyone who has friends. It can be played with four people, each commanding their own army. I have to wonder what a co-op campaign would look like for the game.\n\n\nFor that matter, I’m curious about the single-player campaign. The trailer shows the player jumping back and forth between the medieval setting and the future. The footage focuses more on the core gameplay without really revealing what will tie it together. However, I really enjoyed Road Redemption and appreciate the developer's approach, so I’m totally on board.\n\n\nKingmakers is planned to launch into Steam Early Access sometime in 2024.\n\nThe post Kingmakers is an isekai shooter-strategy hybrid that has you wade into medieval battles with heavy firepower appeared first on Destructoid.",

To celebrate this – and because you need more Fallout in your life – Bethesda is launching an anthology of all the games in the series.\n\n\nThe S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (my word, is that a pain to type out!) Anthology set is launching April 11 and comes with a total of seven games. You'll get Fallouts 1-4, New Vegas, 76, and even the 2001 release Tactics.\n\n\n\n\nTo cap it off, the set will arrive in a mini-nuke that makes an \"audible bomb\" sound when you open it. I can't see how that could possibly go wrong in a public setting! You'll also get S.P.E.C.I.A.L. cards, each with a PC code for the games. Pre-orders are being taken now, but the anthology isn't available on console from what I can tell.\n\n\nThe \"S\" stands for Steam...\n\n\nWe're not quite done with Fallout just yet. As well as the classic games becoming available on Epic Games Store for free at some point this year (after Epic changed its mind initially), we're also still waiting for the next-gen upgrade of F4.\n\n\nBethesda told us late last year that we need to wait a little bit longer for that. Not to mention the fifth entry in the series, which is said to be in the pipeline. But who knows when we'll see either of those...\n\n\nSome may prefer the older, non-Bethesda games, while others are happier with the direction the series has gone in since Fallout 3. It doesn't really matter which side you fall on. At least with this anthology set, you get to play them all.\n\nThe post Bethesda is launching a huge Fallout anthology collection just before the TV show airs appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, some good news is on the horizon, as the company will launch them as part of its storefront giveaways. Just not yet.\n\n\nAccording to a recent report from IGN, Epic has been in touch with the publication to say the classic Fallout releases will be up for grabs \"later this year.\" A spokesperson confirmed that the first two games plus Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel will be included.\n\n\nImage via 14° East/Steam.\n\n\nThe original plan was to have all three available on Epic Games Store between February 22 and February 29. However, it was quietly pulled, being replaced by Super Meat Boy.\n\n\nSome love is needed for these cult hits\n\n\nIt's a bit of a shame we don't exactly know when they'll be available for free. All we know is that it'll be sometime this year. At least it's happening at all, given that fans had the rug pulled out from underneath them recently.\n\n\nThere's a good chance a lot of people reading this have only experienced Fallout 3 and beyond. When Bethesda took over the franchise for the 2008 installment, the series went from having more of a cult status on PC to being a mainstream, AAA release.\n\n\nAs and when the older games do become free on Epic Games Store, I would urge you to try them out.

On Wednesday, Nintendo will host a Partner Showcase Direct on its channels.\n\n\nNintendo's Partner Showcase will air on February 21 at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on its YouTube channel. The company says to expect around 25 minutes of info, focused on Nintendo Switch games arriving in the first half of 2024 from publishing and developing partners.\n\n\n\n\nNo switch-up\n\n\nSo yes, let's just get this out of the way now: with the words \"Partner\" and explicit emphasis on the external side of publishing and developing, I would not expect any sort of big Switch 2 reveal or anything. Heck, even a reveal of something like Metroid Prime 4 is likely out of the cards.\n\n\nIf you're looking for the regular reason to over-hype yourself, though, there's always Hollow Knight: Silksong. More realistically, studios like Level-5 have been making regular appearances at shows like these, and that company in particular pushed a big batch of games into 2024. I'd put some good odds on Level-5 showing up, though to be clear, that's just speculation on my part.\n\n\nOtherwise, expect a lot of non-Nintendo games coming to Switch. It's an interesting choice, seeing as this is Nintendo's first Direct of the year, and the same time as they'd usually host a big Direct to kick it off. It's a shame the company isn't putting any of its own stuff into the mix, and at 25 minutes compared to a hopeful 40 or so, I imagine we'll still hear speculation about a full Nintendo Direct long after.\n\n\nAt least for now, we can spin down the rumors and look forward to seeing what's hitting Switch soon, as it enters its seventh year of life.

At the time, the alleged game had been rated by the ESRB, and now the Ubisoft title has shown up on the Korean ratings board.\n\n\nThe Game Rating and Administration Committee (or GRAC for short) has listed the project on its website, and has given it a 12+. While the site is in Korean, the actual title is right there in plain English, referring to it as Beyond Good and Evil Remaster. The listing was added on February 16, so this is pretty fresh.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nGranted, we already knew that this was happening, as Ubisoft itself confirmed it. Still, we've yet to see anything beyond the confirmation. The original came out in November 2003, so it's a little late if this is going to be a special 20th year special.\n\n\nStill no sequel, though\n\n\nA remaster is great, of course, but what a lot of people are ideally wanting is a sequel. As I say, the game came out at the start of the new millennium. While a sequel has been in the works for some time, it's pretty much in development hell at this stage. Who knows whether it will ever see the light of day.\n\n\nIn any case, we may still get a modern take on the first (and only) game. Remastering it will likely mean a tweak to the controls to make them more modern (a lot has changed these past two decades) and, of course, sleeker visuals.\n\n\nWe've been promised a Beyond Good and Evil 2 for years.

          "description": "While it may be overshadowed at the moment by its RPG counterpart, Granblue Fantasy: Relink, the formidable fighter Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is not one to sit back. Two months after the announcement trailer, Nier: Automata's 2B is back with a new trailer showcasing some devastating fighting and a killer version of Weight of the World.\n\n\nAnother reminder of Nier: Automata's greatness\n\n\n2B is set to become available on February 20, 2024, as the second DLC fighter. Her pack will cost $7.99 individually. Alternatively, players who have purchased the Deluxe Character Pass 1 will receive the android alongside five other DLC fighters. Aside from her iconic swords, Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty, 2B (and 2P) can wield a large number of weapons from the YoRHa armory. \n\n\nScreenshot via [GBVS] Granblue Fantasy Versus Official Channel YouTube\n\n\nAt this point, 2B is a safe bet for just about any game. The character is overwhelmingly loved by gamers, no matter their preferred genre. It's to the point that even if she's not a legitimate addition to a title, you can almost guarantee there's a mod that adds her in some way, shape, or form.\n\n\n\n\nWhile she doesn't exactly mesh with the world of Granblue, 2B is immune from much criticism due to the \"rule of cool.\" Be it Final Fantasy XIV, Soulcalibur VI, and more, Square Enix knows that she prints money and will license the character for just about anything. That's a huge win if you're a fan, and even if you're not, you get to beat the white-haired war machine into the ground.\n\nThe post 2B does work to a sick Weight of the World remix in new Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A recent SteamDB listing seems to indicate that Dragon's Dogma 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the best \"recent\" IP in Capcom's catalog, might be getting a demo soon. \n\n\nThe hype started when u/CannedBeanofDeath on Reddit noticed a telltale piece of intel below:\n\n\n\n\nIt merely lists the addition of an \"Unknown App\" to the Dragon's Dogma 2 backend on Steam. Still, there are only so many things that this unknown app can turn out to be, namely, the Dragon's Dogma 2 demo. The smoking gun here seems to be that the \"Unknown App\" is listed as \"free on demand\", a status that usually applies to demos.\n\n\nAs of the time of this writing, there's no confirmation from Capcom that this will be the demo, but we know that Capcom sure loves their demos, and we also know that the release of DD2 will take place about one month from now. This would be a great time to get a demo out.\n\n\nThe original Dragon's Dogma wasn't exactly a massive hit when it first came out, possibly due to it not featuring the most amazing graphics of its era. Luckily, players quickly realized the game was filled with ultra-fresh gameplay ideas, such as having to climb huge enemies to kill them. You won't be getting much giant-slaying done here by hitting monsters in their feet until they inexplicably die.\n\n\nEver since its release back in 2012, Dragon's Dogma name has been growing in the hearts of the gaming community. It's only natural that a lot of people are already revving up the engine of the sequel's hype train.\n\n\nDragon's Dogma 2 will come out on March 22 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nThe post Dragon’s Dogma 2 demo could be on its way, per Steam update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It looks like the rumors from last year of a \"Complete Edition\" of Shin Megami Tensei V might have been accurate after all. According to Gematsu, an official rating popped up from the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea for Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. The description for the rating indicated it was a complete edition of Shin Megami Tensei V with improvements and additional content. The rating was later removed.\n\n\n\n\nNo platforms or any other information was provided, but it would be par for the course for Atlus to be porting Shin Megami Tensei V to other consoles. Even though SMTV is the best-selling entree in the franchise, as of now it's been a Switch exclusive. With the massive Persona fanbase that has grown on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC over the last few years, surely there are some fans on those consoles looking for a chance to play. Even though the two franchises are different, there's some pretty big overlaps in terms of gameplay.\n\n\nHonestly, I'd be included in that bunch. Shin Megami Tensei V looks amazing and I've heard the story is top-notch. But for me, there's certain types of game I'd prefer to play on ms Switch and others I'd prefer to play on PS5. SMTV is one of those games. I'd be happy for a 1:1 port, but with the description mentioning improvements and additional content this will probably be a no-brainer for me.\n\n\n\nThe post Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance appears, disappears on Korean rating board appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.\nWe’ll let the trailer speak for itself.\n\n\nIn Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.\nSince the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  \nRedemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. \nRedemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we'll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.",

          "description": "Nintendo will air a Partner Showcase of its Direct videos this week on Wednesday, February 21. Unlike a traditional Direct, Partner Showcases are presentations that highlight upcoming third-party games for Switch.\nThe Direct will air at 6 a.m. Pacific/9 a.m. Eastern on YouTube and will run for 25 minutes. Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”\nIgnoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:\nInkulinati\nUnicorn Overlord\nGylt\nHighwater\nSouth Park: Snow Day!\nOpen Roads\nBotany Manor\nTales of Kenzera: Zau\nSaGa Emerald Beyond\nBraid: Anniversary Collection\nNumerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.\nOr we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. \nOf course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out. What do you hope to see in the Partner Direct? Let us know in the comments!",

Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it.

They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.\nAccording to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.\nSpencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.\nBond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.\n\n\nThe podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.",

          "description": "It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.\nThe video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. \n\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. \nWith Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). \nWe don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.",

Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. \nThe video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.\n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.",

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the \"where\" and \"when\": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.\nWhen the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.\nWhat do you think the future of Xbox looks like?

This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf.

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.\nWhile 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

You can see the developer's full statement below.\nAfter 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat.

It also wrote, \"The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!\" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.\nFor more on Evil Empire, you can read Game Informer's impressions of the Dead Cells: Return to Castelvania DLC.",

          "description": "Persona 3 Reload is finally here, and fans of the series have welcomed it with open arms, happily becoming reacquainted with the high schoolers who get magical powers from a shot to the head. Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

          "description": "Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.",

The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.",

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.",

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
