On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different.

But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here.

So I thought it worth mentioning that you can now pick up this 2TB high-end drive for £85, following a price drop from £93 at Amazon UK.\nRead more",

Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. \nOn its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing? \nRead more",

It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Red Thread Games, who made Draugen (a horror game I liked quite a bit), are adding to the list with Dustborn, a single-player action-adventure with a heavy lean towards story, which was revealed at this year's Gamescom Opening Night Live.\nYou play Pax, a pregnant con-artist on the run transporting an important package across the Northern border of what appears to be an authoritarian, dystopian USA. And you tell me this is in no way related to Road 96? Well, alright. Dustborn is being published by Quantic Dream, so I feel dutybound to make fun of it. No. Must... resist...\nRead more",

The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there's a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that's capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we've written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won't mean much to a lot of you.

And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault.

Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).\nThe rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.\nRead more",

Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. \nIt's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.\nRead more",

After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.\nIndeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.\nRead more",

This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.\nDespite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.\nRead more",

Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.\nI think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.\nDon't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.\n Read more",

The original Ghostrunner bashed the first-person parkour of Mirror’s Edge with cyberpunky ninja swords to great success, and the sequel bolts on a rideable bike and a parry system to the winning formula. \nRead more",

Life By You and Paralives both have grand plans to unseat (or at least share it with) EA’s life sim juggernaut, and they both promise to set themselves apart with features that Simmers have long been asking for. But I only have one question for both of them: can I kill my Sims? Or Parafolk? Or… Lifers? In the case of Paralives, the answer is thankfully a big fat yes. \nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. \r\n\n\r\n“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.\r\n\n\r\nThe update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.\r\n \nRead more",

The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) \"lore\", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.\nIt's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?\nRead more",

Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.\r\n\nNow it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There's a first trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Problém řeší analog in-memory computing, kdy se maticové násobení vektorem dělá paralelně v paměťových dlaždicích (memory tiles). Používá se k tomu phase-change memory (PCM). Malý kousek materiálu se roztaví a podle rychlosti chlazení buď zkrystalizuje (pomalu) a bude vodivý, nebo zůstane amorfní (rychle) a bude nevodivý. Zároveň můžete mít i více analogových stavů mezi těmito dvěma extrémy.",

Proto jsou grafické karty s GPU Nvidia na Linuxu rozumně použitelné jen s uzavřeným ovladačem přímo od Nvidie. Ale to se možná změní.",

One of the notable changes with this new kernel version is Linux now defaulting to the AMD P-State \"EPP\" active driver configuration for modern Ryzen systems rather than the long-used generic ACPI CPUFreq driver default. In some cases this can mean better performance but particularly should yield a nice improvement to the power efficiency of Ryzen Zen 2 and newer platforms, especially laptops and other portable Linux systems like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally. I am working on some fresh AMD Ryzen Linux laptop comparison benchmarks but for this article is a look at Linux 6.5 on the desktop side with the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X.",

That is, if they even remember the name. I say that because I could never really remember it. Not until I became interested in pre-3D racing games.\nThis is mostly because Rad Mobile was only once ported to console and never in North America.

Enemies should no longer spot you when they shouldn't be able to, and random items should no longer defy gravity and float.

However, there might be more to look forward to. The game's director, Davide Soliani, teased a return to glory for the French platforming mascot Wednesday. He also confirmed there will be a secret message if you finish the DLC with a 100% completion rate. The prospects of the first Rayman game since 2013 might come to fruition.\nAccording to fan community leader ItzalDrake from Rayman Together, Sparks of Hope director Davide Soliani sent a message to the character's fanbase just before the launch of the Phantom Show DLC:\n\"I hope that all the community and all Rayman players support us as much as possible because I'm on a mission: my mission is to be able to bring Rayman back to the glory he deserves.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RaymanTogether/status/1694386555723342118\nWhen was the last Rayman game released?\nThe limbless hero has been absent for a long time, which is strange as he was an important mascot for Ubisoft during the beginning of the studio's history. The last true game in the series was Rayman Legends, released back in 2013: a decade ago this month. If you want to go all the way back, the last 3D platforming adventure Rayman 3 came out in 2003. A fourth entry or even a follow-up to the 2D platforming subseries would be a dream for many fans of the series.\nSoliani did not outright confirm a new game in the series, but as previously mentioned, he has teased a secret hidden message for those who 100% complete the DLC. \"I hope for your support and I hope you like it!\" he concluded in his message to the fans.\nThe post Sparks of Hope director teases return to “glory” for Rayman and secret DLC message appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer Shiro Games and publisher Funcom announced plans to bring Version 1.0 to Steam in September 2023. There's also a release trailer to go along with the news. The new preview shows off more of the real-time warfare and the various means of political sabotage at your disposal.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZJPQ2dRt-8\nDune: Spice Wars originally launched in Early Access on April 26, 2022. The 4X real-time strategy game tasks players with battling for control over Arrakis. Multiple factions—including House Atreides and House Harkonnen—are available along with key characters from Frank Herbert's novel. \n[caption id=\"attachment_399159\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Shiro Games[/caption]\nTremors\nIn addition to controlling spice resources and pulling off acts of subterfuge to expand, you'll need to watch out for sandworms. Ignoring wormsign is a great way to lose your spice harvesters and troops. The number of games featuring any form of giant worm management or warning system in place is shockingly low. We'll take what we can get and consider it a bonus if a quality RTS happens to be attached. \nThe folks behind Dune: Spice Wars previously worked on Northgard, a strategy survival game based on Norse mythology. Northgard launched in 2018 and received its latest major update in April 2023. Like Northgard, players seem mostly positive on Spice Wars so far. Hopefully this sandworm will boast a similarly long post-launch tail. \nIf you're looking for more on how this one came together, the devs have been fairly active in showing off concept art and other details.\nThe post Dune: Spice Wars leaves Early Access this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

As the name implies, this will be a celebration of all things tactical. A recent promo video gives a brief hint at what's to come.\nhttps://youtu.be/xYp3ugqPxiA\nThe event will kick off Monday, August 28 at 10AM Pacific and will go on until September 4, so that's a week in which to get your strategy on (that's a saying, right?)\nWhat's to be expected?\nAs always, Steam isn't saying absolutely everything about Strategy Fest. Suffice it to say, you can find demos and discounted games on sale throughout the week. As for what's going to be on offer, it's hard to say, but the short video above outlines a few titles that are likely to be included, such as Dune: Spice Wars and The Riftbreaker. Essentially, if this is a genre you're into, you're bound to find something you like.\nConsidering that we recently had the Visual Novel Fest, and before that the Stealth Fest, Valve does a good job of making sure we all stay tuned into its gaming platform.

          "description": "The paranormal horror game Phasmophobia originally launched on September 18, 2020, on PC where it enjoyed popularity among streamers. Kinetic Games has PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports in the works, but you'll have to wait a little longer than expected before you can get your hands on them. The studio has announced that the game has been delayed, pushing its Early Access console launch from August to October, in the week leading up to Halloween.\nhttps://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1694849069045194958?t=tRaDEz-xKbFYrOeZT2OxnQ&s=19\nAs the studio explains on Twitter, the delay is the result of a \"fire incident\" in its office building, along with \"unpredicted development issues.\" With the extra time gained by the delay, the studio hopes to perfect and fine-tune the ports.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399024\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Kinetic Games.[/caption]\nPhasmophobia lands just in time for Halloween\nThe delay isn't too long, and in the meantime, PC players can enjoy the recently released Ascension update which brings several changes, including a new leveling system with \"new rates of progression, new unlocks, and a prestige system,\" along with several minor bug fixes.\nPS5 owners will be happy to know that a PS VR2 version is also in the works, and crossplay will allow friends to play together regardless of what platform they're on. The game has already demonstrated that it is capable of providing a terrifying VR experience thanks to its VR support on PC.\nPhasmophobia's minor delay pushes it into an appropriately spooky time, which could end up being a positive for it. However, Phasmophobia will have to contend with several other headliners scheduled for October, including horror titles like Alan Wake 2 and Alone in the Dark.\nThe post Phasmophobia console launch delayed to October due to “fire incident” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced that the next game joining the Nintendo Switch Online (Expansion Pack) line-up. Excitebike 64 will be arriving on August 30.\nExcitebike 64 is generally remembered as being a better-than-expected motocross game. It was a rather strange title where, if you looked past the rather generic visuals and excess of dirt, you’d be rewarded with a lot of strangeness. This includes a soccer mini-game that the internet likes to call the original version of Rocket League and an endless desert.\nIt also got an unexpectedly awesome trailer:\nhttps://youtu.be/mVHhNyEQeio?feature=shared\nI rented Excitebike 64 back in the day and loved it. When I reunited with it years later, I couldn’t find that same spark. I pick it up every now and then, trying to remember why I loved it so much, and still can’t do it. There’s too much dirt. Too much bike. Not enough excite. Still, remember when Nintendo had its own line of sports games that didn’t involve Mario? I prefer Mario sports games over real ones, but I also love variety.\nThis is the fourth of five games Nintendo promised us for 2023. Many have been pointing out that somehow Mario Party 3 is currently the one left out. Considering the first two Mario Party games were released in 2022, it’s kind of strange that they aren’t in more of a hurry to complete the trilogy.\nIt would also be nice if they added more non-Nintendo titles. The Star Wars games, maybe? The Goemon games? Hybrid Heaven? It doesn’t really matter to me, personally, since I have an extensive N64 collection. However, there’s more to experience on the console than just Nintendo’s contributions.\nExcitebike 64 will be arriving on the Nintendo Switch Online N64 app on August 30.\nThe post Get ready for dirt bike soccer, Excitebike 64 gets added to Nintendo Switch Online on August 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's been five years since we were treated to a brief tease of the next installment in Bethesda's flagship series, and the face of the studio seems to regret being too hasty with things.\nIn a recent interview with GQ, Mr. Skyrim himself, Todd Howard, says he me have been a bit too quick to announce TES6, adding, \"I probably would've announced it more casually.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/OkFdqqyI8y4\nOf course, the interviewer asks whether Howard can divulge any further details about The Elder Scrolls 6. Naturally, the director isn't saying anything, though he does say that the upcoming RPG does have a codename. He also says that he and the team want the next TES game to \"fill that role of the ultimate fantasy-world simulator.\"\nSo when is it co-\nWhen's it coming out, I hear you ask? Again, nobody can really say. As a sidenote, Howard does make a comment about how he wants to keep making games, with no plans to retire any time soon. He even likens his career path to Nintendo's own Shigeru Miyamoto, who's now in his early 70s.\nIt's at this point that the GQ interviewer offers their own speculation, saying that The Elder Scrolls 6 may not be out until Todd Howard reaches 60. Given that his Wikipedia page has him down as being either 52 or 53, this means TES6 might still be a good seven or eight years off.\nObviously, that's just speculation. Although recent rumors suggest the long-awaited follow-up to Skyrim might be at least five years away. In any case, Bethesda definitely seemed to have done itself a disservice by announcing it so soon.\nThe post Todd Howard wishes he’d announced Elder Scrolls 6 ‘more casually’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fans were initially excited when the game was announced, though it quickly drew criticism when developers announced that NFTs would be included. The Ukrainian studio backtracked on this, though it then had to contend with the Russian invasion of Ukraine which resulted in the game's delay.\nAs revealed in a fact sheet from the studio at Gamescom 2023, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has been delayed yet again, pushing its release date to Q1 2024. This may be disappointing news but with a new trailer out, you can rest assured that GSC Game World is still working hard on the upcoming game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_398998\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via GSC Game World.[/caption]\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's development has been anything but predictable\nIt was inevitable that the Ukranian studio would be affected by the ongoing conflict, as it was based in Kyiv. When the invasion began, development was paused as the studio relocated to Prague and employees fled the conflict zone. Some decided to stay and fight alongside the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nhttps://youtu.be/bcDHClWRHd8\nThe studio has also found itself subject to cyberattacks originating in Russia, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's site was banned from the country after it ceased operations there. Despite the setbacks, the studio has continued to condemn the Russian invasion while embracing its Ukranian roots.\nhttps://twitter.com/stalker_thegame/status/1694655679271690472\nOn a more positive note, preorders for the game are finally available, which represents some progress. It has also received positive reception at Gamescom 2023 where a playable demo was available, indicating that the long wait might be worth it.\nThe post S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 delayed to 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I think a game industry where every title is tripping over each other in an attempt to be the most meaningful experience you have had would be pretty miserable. Developers should have fun with the creative process. It should be fulfilling to them. Otherwise, we’d just be getting our entertainment from workers on an assembly line. That’s not how art works.\nThis might be obvious, but I say that because Orbo’s Odyssey did not combust my crotch. I played it because I like the cut of the developer’s jib. Feverdream Johnny is probably best known for their work on Nowhere, MI. They’ve partnered with Ben Drury for this sort of spin-off or sequel to Peeb Adventures. So, I guess I’m here to spec…",

While Baldur's Gate 3 is now looking set to debut on Xbox Series consoles this year, it won't have split-screen co-op for the Series S version.\nVincke announced that, after meeting with Xbox head Phil Spencer, the team found a \"solution\" to bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Xbox players.\n\"All improvements will be there, with split-screen coop on Series X,\" said Vincke. \"Series S will not feature split-screen coop, but will also include cross-save progression between Steam and Xbox Series.\"\nSplit vision\nWhile no split-screen co-op will disappoint Series S owners, Vincke stated back in June that split-screen would be one of the potential hangups for the Xbox version. He mentioned compromises might need to be made for an Xbox version, and it looks like lack of split-screen on Series S is going to be among them. Microsoft typically requires feature parity between Xbox Series games, but for now this is one bullet point that will stay on Series X. \nIn an interview with IGN earlier this week, Spencer had commented on the Baldur's Gate 3 situation. \"The decision to do split-screen or not is a creative decision, a dev decision,\" Spencer said. \"So if we think about Forza, it has nothing to do with any kind of hardware thing on S and X, just where they wanted to focus their time.\" Vincke had previously confirmed to IGN that Xbox had committed some help to Larian in getting BG3 up to scratch on its consoles.\nNext up for Baldur's Gate 3 is the PlayStation 5 version. Larian will bring the game to Sony's console on September 6, following an earlier delay.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 is coming to Xbox this year, but no split-screen co-op for Series S appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, simple confirmation of the NG+ existing in Starfield is pretty exciting as it would be the first Bethesda Game Studios title to feature the mode. The NewGame Plus mod added NG+ support for Fallout 4, but otherwise, it has just been a highly requested feature.\nAccording to the interview with GQ, your skill traits and backstory perks when creating a character will add a unique and exciting twist on New Game Plus and incentivize continued and repeat play.\n[caption id=\"attachment_398844\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bethesda Game Studios[/caption]\nEven more content for Starfield with New Game Plus\nGamescom has given us an idea of how long we can expect to spend in Starfield. Bethesda's Head of Publishing, Pete Hines, even mentioned we could potentially spend hundreds of hours in a Starfield playthrough.\nI'm very curious about exactly how New Game Plus will work. In an open-world adventure with over 1,000 planets to explore, a single playthrough will surely have plenty of content. I'm excited to see what sort of new features or content will be available by going on the journey again. Either way, now that I know Starfield has a New Game Plus mode, perhaps I won't spend hours going back and forth on the starting traits I choose.\nI suppose we'll know soon enough. Starfield releases on September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It will also be a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass. Players who pre-ordered the Premium Edition will get early access to Starfield on September 1.\nThe post Starfield has a New Game Plus mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest from publisher Playstack and developer 2Awesome Studio ranks high on the \"we came up with the title first\" list, but thankfully, it also looks like a good time. The top-down roguelite shooter now has a date and a trailer showing off its fast-paced fireworks.\nThis axolotl with an AK rolls into action on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam on September 14, 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xteTxUFl2xs\nThe gunplay in AK-xolotl looks pretty hectic, with some downright bullet hell-style patterns on display. In roguelite fashion, death isn't the end; it's just an excuse to start over, get stronger, and unlock new weapons. It's all accentuated with the help of nice looking pixel art visuals and some impressive sprite work, so hopefully the final game matches that energy. \nLook who's talkin'\nBeyond the frantic shooting, AK-xolotl introduces an ally-raising system with the Axolittles. These little baby axolotls can be nurtured and fed until they eventually grow into adorable killing machines of their own. It looks like nurturing may involve putting diapers on them? This is the most I've ever thought about axolotls, much less changing their diapers. \nBased in Barcelona, 2Awesome Studio previously developed cyberpunk action-platformer Aeon Drive and shoot 'em up Dimension Drive. They also handle publishing and porting for a few other titles.

Genshin Concert is a live orchestral performance showcasing some of the gorgeous music in Genshin Impact. Ticket sales are staggered based on location, with Singapore and Malaysia opening up first.\nBoth dates for Singapore’s concerts were sold out in a matter of minutes, described by one Reddit user as an “absolute bloodbath.” Malaysia’s ticketing website was overwhelmed entirely, resulting in an error where people couldn’t even join the queue.\nIt’s not just Asian locations that are mad for tickets though. Two American locations began their own ticket sales shortly thereafter. New York has two concerts, and both of them reached a ticket queue of over 4,000 people within five minutes of opening. At least the website is holding up though! The same can’t be said for the website handling Mexico’s sales, which was still returning a 508 error half an hour after opening.\nOther locations in the US, Asia, and Europe have yet to open their ticket sales. Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago tickets open tomorrow. If you’re at all interested in snagging a ticket for yourself, be prepared to camp out early to get your place in the queue and may the Archons be with you.\nTicket Gacha and Scalping\nThe mad rush for tickets has some people suggesting that ticket sales should be based on a lottery — adding a gacha element to the gacha game’s live concert. The idea is being handled with varying degrees of seriousness, with some users joking about buying multiple tickets for a chance at a VIP seat.\nScalping has already begun too. Sale listings for Singapore and Malaysia tickets have begun appearing on Carousell, a marketplace platform for Southeast Asia.

As far as we can tell, it's still the same old Elder Scrolls 3.

L4D2 is still getting a lot of love and, in fact, it recently received a small update that comes packed with tweaks, as well as one sought-after change.\nAs spotted by PC Gamer, the patch notes for the latest update to Left 4 Dead 2 notes that, among other things, Valve has finally decided to name the Swamp Fever gator, something that's apparently been requested by the community. From this day forth, the \"swamp gator\" shall canonically be known as...Fred. Do with this info as you must.\n[caption id=\"attachment_398633\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Valve/Steam.[/caption]\nAccording to my own Steam account, this patch is only a 2MB download, but as you can see from the notes, there's a laundry list of tinkering that's gone on.\nStill rockin' the Steam charts\nAnd why shouldn't the developer keep its 14-year-old zombie co-op game alive and well? It's an absolute classic in the genre, giving more of what people loved in the original release. It's still going pretty strong overall. At the time of writing, SteamDB registers almost 27,000 players fightin' hordes in Left 4 Dead 2 right now. Also, the game is currently at the number 44 spot on the Steam charts.\nThat might not sound impressive, but considering Elden Ring is just ahead at 40 and Cyberpunk 2077 is trailing behind at position 48, Valve's classic FPS is still managing to pull in enough players. Although we were supposed to be seeing a return to the L4D format with Turtle Rock Studios' Back 4 Blood, it didn't quite hit the mark. For many, it was a decent zombie shooter, but it just couldn't reach the heights of Valve's long-dormant series.\nThe post Left 4 Dead 2 update finally names Swamp Fever gator, because why not appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Video game and general graphical technology is advancing so fast, that it's tough to keep up with it. Now, Nvidia has announced that the latest version of its Deep Learning Super Sampling (or DLSS) is on the way, and it's already going to support some modern titles.\nDetails can be found on Nvidia's website. The long and the short of it is: DLSS 3.5 is due to release sometime this fall. It represents the next stage in Team Green's upscaling AI tech, with a recent video from the company explaining just how it's better than previous iterations.\nhttps://youtu.be/sGKCrcNsVzo\nOn top of that, games like Alan Wake 2 and Portal RTX will support version 3.5, as will the upcoming Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077.\nOne for you graphical purists\nThe recent video announcing DLSS 3.5 gives an overview of how the people at Nvidia have improved the image upscaling algorithm. Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research, says this latest version will feature Ray Reconstruction.\nHow does it work? Catanzaro gives some insight into how it differs from the ray tracing technology many of us have come to be familiar with. Suffice it to say, most casual gamers probably won't be too concerned with the details. However, side-by-side comparisons showing Cyberpunk with all the iterations of DLSS (including 3.5) do show a difference in quality, especially when it comes to bolder colors in light reflections.\nAs always, the upcoming Nvidia AI will only be compatible with RTX-enabled graphics cards. Bit of a shame that it's not more open source, but no doubt AMD (and possibly Intel) will follow closely with newer and more powerful versions of their own upscaling alternatives.\nThe post Nvidia announces DLSS 3.5, will support Cyberpunk DLC and Alan Wake 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "BioWare is a large studio known for titles such as Mass Effect: Andromeda and Dragon Age: Inquisition. It appears that all is not well at the studio, as on August 23, it announced that it is \"eliminating approximately 50 roles.\"\nAccording to a statement released by general manager Gary McKay, the move was made to help BioWare become a \"more agile and more focused studio.\" McKay states that this is an unavoidable outcome, and steps will be taken to \"ensure the process is handled with empathy, respect, and clear communication.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_398647\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bioware.[/caption]\nWhat's going on at BioWare?\nAccording to McKay, BioWare's long-term vision is to deliver \"exceptional story-driven single-player experiences filled with vast worlds and rich characters.\" This involves ensuring that the upcoming Dragon Age and Mass Effect games are a success. The announcement reveals that the studio's dedication to Dragon Age: Dreadwolf hasn't wavered, and that a team led by Mike Gamble is still working on the next Mass Effect game.\nEmployees affected by the layoffs won't be left stranded, according to McKay who promises to provide \"impacted colleagues with as many internal opportunities as possible,\" though he does state that it is unlikely that everyone will find new internal roles. With several roles opening up in Electronic Arts' other studios, affected workers will also be assisted with their applications for these positions.\nThis is unfortunate news, though BioWare isn't the only studio that has suffered layoffs this year. The AR gaming studio Niantic has also met the same fate, as well as CD Projekt Red and  The Callisto Protocol's Striking Distance, to name a few.\nThe post BioWare hit with layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I’m not above being lured in by aesthetic. Draft of Darkness hooked me in with its grainy, pixelated photo manipulation. It looks like a tacky game that followed in the wake of Mortal Kombat. In fact, it would fit right in alongside titles that pushed the limits of tastefulness back in the ‘90s. It’s hypnotic.\nIn my experience, a well-executed aesthetic can be indicative not necessarily of a game’s quality, but of its inventiveness. Not always, but sometimes. My favorite type of game is one where the developers fucked around and found out. However, that methodology doesn’t always result in an appealing game.\nDraft of Darkness is so well-executed in its mechanics that it makes them seem accidental. Aesthetics aside, everything I’ve seen surrounding the game makes it out to be this quiet lit…",

Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. \nAshmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx\nAugust 25, 2023\n“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment,\" says Ashmore in the video. \"Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will.\"\nAlan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest.

Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. \nThe game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: \n\n\n“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” \nThis sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” \n\nIf you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship.

However, it will be missing a multiplayer feature – split-screen co-op – on the Xbox Series S. \nBaldur’s Gate 3 has been perhaps the biggest surprise hit of 2023 – we gave it one of the highest scores of the year – although Early Access players have been singing the RPG’s praises for a while now. It launched on PC earlier this month and is due on PlayStation 5 next month. Earlier this summer, Larian said it wants to launch Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox this year but might push into 2024 due to parity issues between Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. \n\n\nNow, it's been confirmed the RPG will hit Xbox this year after a meeting between Baldur’s Gate 3 director Swen Vincke and Xbox head Phil S…",

First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vampire Survivors on Switch, Gunbrella, Mr. Run and Jump,  The Crew Motorfest, Ra Ra Boom, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Sea of Stars.",

The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.\nThe free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.\nLil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC.

However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” \nThe PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. \n\nPSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. \nPlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.",

Now, two and a half years following the release of the last mainline entry, fans of the first two critically acclaimed games have something new to be excited for. Bandai Namco has announced that Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games is developing a new entry in the Little Nightmares universe. Not only that, but we got our first look at Little Nightmares III.\nLittle Nightmares III gives players the story of Low and Alone, two children trapped within The Spiral, which is a cluster of disturbing places, and they need to work together to escape from a threat that is lurking in the shadows.

Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.\nFor any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now.

They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. \nSimilar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals. \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.",

Phantom Liberty is a paid expansion that will include all kinds of new story content and Idris Elba, but even if you don't buy into the expansion, the game will receive all kinds of improvements.\n\n\nThe footage from the game showed protagonist V launching herself from a motorcycle to slam into a group of enemies. New weapons, like guns and blades will be added and perks have been redesigned. There are also all kinds of new animations in the combat. We also saw V throwing an enemy at another in combat and dashing in mid-dair. The police have also been revamped and will call in MaxTac to fight you, you can hack while driving, and new vehicles will have built in guns for expanded car combat.\nThe 2.0 update releases September 26 and the paid Phantom Liberty expansion will also be available that day.

It was set to launch in Steam Early Access later this year, but the team needs more time to bring it together.\nAs such, the game will now launch early next year. A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, \n“We've made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a new adventure that lives up to what fans expect from a Heart Machine title.”\n\n\nHyper Light Breaker is a spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, set within the same universe but imagined in 3D graphics. The third-person action game can be played alone or with friends in 3-player online co-op. Players roam the large, colorful world discovering new areas, battling monsters in flashy combat, and obtaining powerful gear in a quest to overthrow a powerful king.

The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. \nAtari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. \n\n\nThe 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:\nAdventure\nCombat\nDodge ‘Em\nHaunted House\nMaze Craze\nMissle Command\nRealsports Volleyball\nSurround\nVideo Pinball\nYar’s Revenge\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\nThe Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.",

Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.\nThank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!\n>",
