Surely any attempt to return to this world and its characters would inevitably lead to disappointment.\nWell, we were flat-out wrong, thankfully.

Though many of these have had us chuckling away or otherwise afraid to turn the light off at night (spaghetti trainer haunts our dreams), none of them have the potential to be quite as annoying as this theory about the games' random number generator (RNG) when in Battle Stadium mode (thanks, Eurogamer).\nOriginally shared on Reddit by u/Lord-Trolldemort, the player found that using the move Frost Breath (an attack with 90% accuracy) wouldn't hit if it was the first accuracy check of the battle.

          "description": "Bewitching.\nAt this point, it’s easy to think that the Metroidvania genre has become played out. The indie community has positively run away with the genre over the past decade, producing projects that need to work increasingly harder to differentiate themselves from the pack. Still, this pressure has also bred some impressive innovation. Who would’ve thought the genre could be mashed well with a cute pinball game? Or what if your only movement option was teleporting? Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team (no, that’s not a new Street Fighter game) has decided to take a crack at this lineage of more offbeat takes on the genre with The Knight Witch, a new Metroidvania that integrates the white-knuckle gameplay of a bullet-hell game like Ikaruga. Though it’s not perfect in how it executes mixing these styles, The Knight Witch still manages to offer a memorable and enjoyable experience that ultimately proves itself to be worthwhile.\nThe narrative in The Knight Witch picks up several years before the events of the game, when society was ruled by the industrious Daigadai clan. Their focus on progress at all costs destroyed the environment and led to a civil war, with the opposition being led by the titular Knight Witches. After a lengthy campaign, the Knight Witches defeated the Daigadai, but the fallout from their epic battle forced society to move underground to rebuild. Years later, the story places you in the role of Rayne, the secret fifth Knight Witch who was never powerful enough to join her sisters and thus went unknown. Things are peaceful enough in Rayne’s underground village, but events quickly take a turn when it’s revealed that the Daigadai weren’t completely wiped out and they’ve come back for revenge. With the famed Knight Witches scattered and broken, it’s thus up to Rayne to defend her home and defeat the Daigadai once and for all.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Gotta go back in time.\nBefore the Wii U Pro Controller and the Switch Pro Controller, the general consensus amongst Nintendo fans was that the GameCube controller was, in fact, the very best plastic shell to enable the wiggling of various thumbsticks. Granted, when compared to what came before it - the safe, yet dependable NES and SNES controllers and uh... whatever that N64 thing was - the GameCube controller didn't need to do a whole lot to come out on top, but it was nevertheless a comfortable, attractive piece of kit (if you ignore the rather terrible C-Stick).\nIf you, like us, long for the simpler days of the GameCube, then the good news is that you can practically turn your Switch into one with Retroflag's Handheld Controller. It's a transparent case that takes the iconic purple colour of the GameCube and whacks on a bunch of similar looking thumbsticks and buttons to pay homage to Nintendo's cute little console box. You've got a proper d-pad here, green and red 'A' and 'B' buttons respectively, slightly curved shoulder buttons, and even a dinky little C-Stick in place of the regular right analogue stick.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Undertale makes for a handy comparison - which makes sense, because many of the team worked on Moon, one of the games that inspired it. \nI'm telling you all this because it might pique your interest in their upcoming sandbox RPG, which we now know will be out at some point next year. \nRead more",

A new video series in which Liam and I spend our precious free time with massive live-service games to see how much they demand from our schedules. Are we able to truly experience everything these games have to offer without sacrificing the bits of our daily routines that keep us from withering away at our monitors? How many hours do you really need to invest in order to fully experience a game? And is it even worth it, in the end? \nInventory Space will – hopefully – give you a better idea of whether mammoth games will slot into your life neatly, or not at all.\nRead more",

And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?\nAnyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins.

Although the remake of Ishin was announced during Sony’s September State Of Play stream, Kenzan seems quite far from being picked up for a revamp.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Matthias Linda is feeling tense. Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's \"still so many little and not so little things to do\" before the big day hits on December 8th. \"[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission,\" he says over email. \"I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then.\"\nBut he also says he's \"happy at the same time\". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to \"build a bridge between the worlds\" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.\nRead more",

It’s honestly awesome. \nI’m a huge fan of mysteries in games, with some of my all-time favouites being Kentucky Route Zero, The Return Of The Obra Dinn, and Disco Elysium. I just like getting wrapped up in a good story that will kick my brain into gear. Strange murders, devious disappearances, and just general strange happenings - I love all of it. \nRead more",

Like all the best couch co-op games, it's very easy to get to grips with the controls: you have a sword, and you can raise it or lower it across three different heights to try and get around your opponent's guard. There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other's blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.\nOh look, now I'm holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I'm holding scissors! Oh, and now it's paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running.

It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).\nIn the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.\nRead more",

          "description": "The United States’ consumer watchdogs, the Federal Trade Commission, are considering filing a lawsuit against Microsoft over the company’s proposed $68.7 billion (£57 billion) buyout of Activision Blizzard. US newspaper Politico report that three anonymous sources with knowledge of the potential antitrust lawsuit have claimed it could happen in December, although any such lawsuit isn't guaranteed. The four FTC commissioners haven’t voted to decide on a complaint yet, and haven’t met with Microsoft or Activision Blizzard lawyers, two of the sources said.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed.

          "description": "I've known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life's calling. My eyesight's terrible, for one, and I guarantee I'd be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don't think I'd even make it through the doors at NASA. They'd take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game's story.\nThere's a good reason for this, though, and it's one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she's anything but. In fact, when she's climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home's little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game's gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It's a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers. \nRead more",

It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.\nMy history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it'll last in the long run and confirms that there's still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.\nRead more",

          "description": "GTA Online’s month-long Heists event concludes on November 30th, and Rockstar are setting the game’s community a challenge to steal a total of $2 trillion in-game over the next week. That would be double what GTA Online players managed during the last Heists Challenge two years ago, when the target was set at the much lower amount of $100 billion. Rockstar are promising a “special reward” later this year if the community hits that $2 trillion total in stolen cash. Buy out Twitter in time for Christmas, maybe?\r\n\n \nRead more",

I don’t know what it is about RPG maker games, but they just hit different.\nSet in a post-apocalypse with no women, you play as Brad who one day finds an abandoned baby girl, names her Buddy, and raises her in secret. Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems. The absurdist comical world together with the awful decisions forced upon you make this a special kind of bleak RPG.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. \"Everything was a dive bar,\" Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. \"It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was.\" His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard (\"As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard\", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.\nBack in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. \"The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it,\" Popovich says.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Pokémon mods are rolling in\nDespite some glaring technical issues, the newest mainline games in the Pokémon series, Scarlet & Violet, have been smash hits. It's likely that Game Freak will do their best to patch the most glaring of glitches out as soon as they can, but that doesn't guarantee that the game's abysmal performance slow-downs will necessarily be fixed. Thankfully, fans are stepping in with mods to make for a smoother Pokémon experience, even though Nintendo is particularly tough on those who modify their games. There are some brave soldiers out there doing Arceus' work to help give us a better gaming experience even at the risk of being struck down by the powers that be, and we have to commend them for that.\nThe modder in question is called \"theboy181,\" and they're creating a mod that allows players to take on the games at a silky smooth 60fps, which is a welcome change for those who have already given Scarlet & Violet a whirl. While the mod is not yet publicly available, and we don't have any information on when to expect the mod's release, theboy181 has posted some proof-of-concept photos to Twitter, and it looks absolutely amazing.\nhttps://twitter.com/theboy181/status/1596759874654048263\nIf you want to give the mod a spin when it eventually comes out, you'll likely have to play it on a PC emulator rather than a Nintendo Switch, as that's how it's being developed in the first place. It's not impossible that theboy181, or another modder, could make it playable on a jailbroken console, and if you're already looking to mod a Nintendo title, I'd bet you're cool with hacking a Switch anyway.\nI find it pretty amazing that players have figured out how to modify games so seamlessly, and while I would have preferred Nintendo release a polished, bug-free title in the first place, knowing that the modding community has our backs makes me feel a bit better about things.\nThe post This Pokémon Scarlet & Violet fan mod will let you run the game in 60fps appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie second trailer tomorrow, November 29.\nThe Direct, as Nintendo is dubbing it, will air live at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. There's no estimation on how long this one will be, though given its prior Direct, this movie teaser will likely be on the shorter side.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1597350002028064768/\nAs Nintendo states in its tweet, no game information will be included in this Nintendo Direct. Much like the first Super Mario Bros. Movie Direct, this one will seemingly focus on just the film. And also, hopefully, more selfie cam talking heads with the cast.\nMario goes to the movies\nIn our first trailer for the new Mario movie in September, we got a pretty good look and feel for what's in store. It seems like a Mario isekai, with the plumber waking up in the Mushroom Kingdom and setting off for adventure.\nMeanwhile, Jack Black's Bowser absolutely stole the show. Both his pre-trailer guest spot and his in-trailer performance as the King of the Koopas was excellent.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPpazvJrHm0\nThere are still some principal performances we're waiting on, though. No sign of Peach or Donkey Kong yet, and we got maybe a smidgeon of Charlie Day's Luigi at the end there.\nConsidering the teaser image for the new Direct features the stained-glass art of Peach's castle, we'll hopefully get more of the cast this time around.\nThe stream goes live at 2 p.m. PT over here on Nintendo's YouTube.

Upcoming Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will have a cabaret mini-game.\nThe Like a Dragon, née Yakuza, series has had a wealth of minigames over the years. But few are as well-remembered as the cabaret ones. First making an appearance in Yakuza 0 and then again in Kiwami 2, these sections have you manage a club of hostesses.\nUnlocking new hostesses through quests and scouting, while also competing with other clubs, became quite an engrossing side activity. And now it looks like the festivities return for Like a Dragon Gaiden.\nhttps://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1597301578675130368\nLike a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name follows longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, after the events of Yakuza 6. The Dragon of Dojima stepped down from the spotlight in the sixth entry as Ichiban Kasuga took over in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. (Kiryu did make an appearance in that entry, but didn't star.)\nGaiden looks to bridge the gap a bit, as Like a Dragon 8 will have both Ichiban and Kiryu in the lead. And from the looks of it, Kiryu has been going through some stuff.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxkn-dcy01k\nA year of dragons\nIt looks like we've got a decent amount of RGG content on its way, as the studio is also due to release Like a Dragon: Ishin next February. With Gaiden also set for 2023 and Like a Dragon 8 aiming for 2024, there's a lot of Kiryu in store for the next year or so.\nAll that said, I'm happy to see the cabaret game returning. It's fondly remembered for a reason, and will hopefully add an extra bit of mini-game oomph to Gaiden. As much as I liked holding meetings in Like a Dragon, I'm ready to manage the club again.\nThe post Like a Dragon Gaiden will have a cabaret mini-game appeared first on Destructoid.",

The comic-book strategy adventure will launch next week on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series, with PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch ports to follow at a later date.\nIn the video, we see the turn-based strategy that Firaxis has finally honed in games such as the acclaimed XCOM series applied to familiar characters from Marvel's huge universe of superheroes, (and villains). Under the guidance of custom protagonist \"The Hunter\", players will utilize the skills of names such as Dr. Stange, Wolverine, Iron Man, Blade, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and The Scarlet Witch to lead an attack on the dark armies of Lillith, Mother of Demons.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Icc7o0ex4&t\nMuch like its XCOM brethren, Midnight Suns will offer up a story-based campaign, in which they will lead a growing team of heroes into the battlefield, utilizing the offensive and defensive capabilities of the crew to ensure a glowing victory in battle. New heroes and abilities will be forged and unlocked as the story progresses, with powerful, scene-clearing Hero Moves being offered to characters who are on a particular roll in the ongoing war against evil.\nThere's no denying that the XCOM titles handle strategic action very well, and this marriage of Firaxis' pedigree with the Marvel universe's cast of exciting characters could result in a fine hour-eater for those long, cold winter evenings. Having already faced a one-year delay, comic book fans need only wait one more week before they get the opportunity to take their favorite characters into battle.\nNot my favorites, of course.

The tidbit was dropped in an interview rolled out this past weekend to subscribers of \"The Secret Onion Cellar\" newsletter.\nLittle has been revealed about the new release since its initial announcement back in 2020. We do know that the mysterious release is a sandbox RPG that will no doubt feature the stylized visuals and thought-provoking narratives synonymous with Onion Games hits such as 1997's Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and 2018's mournful shmup Black Bird. Also, according to Kimura, \"children\" will form the central theme of the new adventure.\n\nIn an additional letter to the fans, as printed by Gematsu. Kimura candidly speaks of the stress and turbulence of being an indie studio, detailing some of the psychological and physical pressures of working under budget and within limitations, while being completely unsure as to whether your release will ultimately hit it big on release. Kimura notes that it is also a very expensive process, that can take its toll on the expenses you have aside for basic living and other day-to-day costs.\n\"Indie game developers are basically bizarre creatures that are constantly running, laughing, and playing chess, all while bleeding profusely,\" concludes Kimura, in a typically colorful and visceral statement, before signing off delightfully as \"Your Indie Game Making Uncle\".\nBlack Bird is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch, and is well worth your time.\nOnion Games' new sandbox RPG due out in 2023 [Gematsu]\nThe post Onion Games’ untitled sandbox RPG will launch in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Specially decorated \"Pocky K.O.\" boxes will be distributed throughout Japan from tomorrow, November 29, with images of the original World Warriors emblazoned on the packaging. Inside, a special code will afford access to Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition, which can be played on mobile platforms and web browsers.\n\nWhat this boils down to is a typically regular edition of the grandfather of fighting games, imbued with extra Pocky advertising. For example, characters will hold Pocky sticks/boxes in their hands during victory poses. As a weird touch, players can achieve a special \"Pocky K.O.\" when the health bar hits the correct chocolate-to-biscuit ratio on an average Pocky stick. Baffling. They could have at least applied Rainbow Edition physics.\nPocky? Partial Credit!\nOf course, I'm not really angry about it. It's darn tragic, mind, but it's harmless fun. It's not even the first time that Pocky and Street Fighter have collaborated. Who remembers Street Fighter V's relatively pointless \"Pocky K.O. Challenge\" — a tournament that featured the same \"sweet spot\" qualifications for landing that elusive Pocky K.O.? Glico has also noted that it plans to build a Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition cabinet to take to trade events. A frightening prospect.

The esoteric game director responded to a tweet about the rumor with little more than a series of question marks — suggesting that if Grasshopper Manufacture were stepping into the iconic world of H.R. Giger's extraterrestrial beings, then it was news to him.\nhttps://twitter.com/suda_51/status/1596118774901805056?s=20&t=CVRjWqcGKVLdtSteYdGYbA\nOf course, the internet being the internet, this has not stopped die-hard fans from thinking that perhaps Suda is merely keeping the project under wraps, and that his tweet is a smoke screen to keep people guessing. Quite honestly, Grasshopper Manufacture seems a baffling choice of developer for 20th Century Fox to contact with an eye to adapting the famous film franchise, one would assume that it would choose a studio with a less stylistic and bespoke approach to game design.\nEither way, you can't blame the fans for being excited. Despite being almost custom designed for gaming, the Alien franchise has had a seriously hit-and-miss relationship with the medium over the decades — with perhaps its best offering being 2014's Alien Isolation. It would be pretty fascinating to see what Suda and his crew could make of the franchise's frightening and violent xenomorphic universe, but it seems that this particular rumor can be laid to rest.\nThe post Suda51 seemingly shuts down Grasshopper Manufacture ‘Alien’ rumor appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stay close\nAfter drudging through internet forum rumors and all sorts of wacky tips that didn't pan out: I finally found the answer to whether or not Pokemon Scarlet and Violet co-op can provide access to exclusives. Well, through experience, I'm here to tell you that it can!\nJust know there is a caveat.\n\nTo be clear, you can catch exclusive Pokemon in co-op from either game that the co-op session has access to, but everything is proximity-based. Spawns will happen for either version (regardless of the host) so long as players are close to each other. Meaning, you can't just go off into another part of the game world and expect to farm all of the exclusives in minutes.\nAs you can see in the above image, I captured Gulpin (a Violet exclusive) in south province area three while in my wife's Violet game, as a Scarlet player (you can also view the proximity in which we were able to get this Gulpin to spawn in the header image). It's also important to note that if your partner is really early in the story, they may not have access to mount-based movement that can get them to some of the later/endgame zones: or may not even have access to some locations entirely. So you are at the mercy of either player's progression that regard.\nWith all that in mind, you can use this trick to your advantage to track down Pokemon as a unit in a really cool, organic way. The other player can potentially look up Pokemon locations on their Pokedex, then you can ride out together and look for them, and capture them together.\nI spent part of the weekend doing just that, and it was a blast!\nThe post PSA: You can collect exclusive Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet co-op, but it’s proximity based appeared first on Destructoid.",

Similar patches for other console and PC platforms are set to follow in the near future.\nThe patch notes are, oddly, only available via the Japanese Sonic Frontiers Twitter. But, thanks to a translation by UpdateCrazy, we know that Version 110 includes fixes for a variety of in-game problems, including UI and map optimization, fixes to audio issues, performance improvements, and fixes for numerous fatal crashes. The new update also cleans out a bug that would cause the Chronos Island boss to randomly disappear upon retry.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfr4kK8phZ4\nSonic Frontiers launched on November 8 to a mish-mash of reviews and divisive fan praise. While some found the new adventure an interesting and unique new take on the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, others were ostracized by repetitive gameplay and a dull, somewhat miserable environment. Much of the fanbase sees Sonic Frontiers as a positive step for the dice-roll franchise, however, and hopes that it represents a new dawn for a series that has had its fair share of terrible releases.\nThere is still work to be done to bring Sonic Frontiers fully up to speed, (pun fully intended), and Sonic Team lead Morio Kishimoto has raised a few eyebrows with his comments that he sees the game's grand worldwide launch akin to a \"global playtest\". Despite this, Kishimoto points to the new title as a landmark moment, reinventing the long-running franchise for a brighter future.\nSonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers patch address issues with map, audio, crashes and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

As winter turns to spring, the taekwondo master and bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan, will make his eagerly awaited return to the ring. Evildoers beware.\nIn addition, spring will see SNK launch an open beta test for its new crossplay functionality, allowing fighters to test their mettle across PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store platforms. Across the remainder of the year, fans can expect more characters and balance patches. This will hopefully keep fan fervor up for what has been a successful first year for The King of Fighters — easily the most relevant that a KoF title has been on the global FGC stage in many years.\nThe King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms.\nThe post The King of Fighters XV season 2 kicks off January 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The developer announced that it will hold an open beta in January 2023 to test the sword-slashing title's new functionality.\nThe beta test will be held on the Steam edition of Samurai Shodown. It will offer SNK the opportunity to fine-tune the stability of the fighter's online mechanics ahead of the official rollback rollout, currently scheduled for spring 2023. Rollback netcode will be applied to the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox ports of Samurai Shodown, though the Nintendo Switch and (inevitably) Stadia releases will be missing out.\nThe arrival of rollback netcode, albeit three years late, will be very welcome to SamSho's devoted community. The 2019 reboot is unique among its fighting brethren, both in its visual design and its playstyle, and as such it deserves a new lease of life. Here's hoping that the update will help bring back some of those wandering ronins to a game that, frankly, deserves a better reputation within the fighting game community.\nSamurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.\nhttps://twitter.com/SNKPofficial/status/1595598325608218624?s=20&t=CtCKGc1TIrQFcSci7H8IWw\nThe post Samurai Shodown rollback beta coming to Steam January 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.\nThe stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.\nhttps://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1595462356230115329\nWhat's the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of \"action, gore, and zombies.\" Hopefully we get to see some details of what's in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.\nRising from the grave\nIt's at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it's been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.\n“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”\nMore delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It's just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.\nWe'll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.\nThe post A Dead Island 2 showcase is set for December 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No need to tack on some more tales just yet\nRagnarok has come and gone for the God of War series. And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.\nIn a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he's asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.\n\"I don't know man, that game is big,\" said Williams. \"I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn't count on it.\"\nWhile there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn't too surprising. God of War (2018) didn't receive any extra DLC.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfJ4Km46A-0\nPatience, boy\nI haven't rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it's a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I'd be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.\nRagnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.\nWhat could those projects be? Well, in the Kinda Funny spoilercast, Williams does mention he'd love to make a Castlevania game. It'd be a sight to see if that collaboration ever does work out.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely, according to director appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Running with the pack\nNetEase Games has made a \"strategic investment\" in the up-and-coming Polish studio Rebel Wolves. The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.\n\"We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. \"Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development.\"\nThis \"world-class AAA game\" is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team's strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title's release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.\nNetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.\nDespite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.\nThe post NetEase Games acquires minority stake in Polish studio Rebel Wolves appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn't the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company's right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.\n\"Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve,\" said Office Create at the time. \"Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.\n\"Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create's approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create's approval.\"\nFollowing this week's legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves.

The studio was picked up earlier this year as part of a transaction that saw holding company Embracer Group acquire much of Square Enix' western subsidiaries, including studios Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, along with their respective IPs.\nSoon after, it was announced that Square Enix Montreal was rebranding as Onoma, which appeared to signal a new lease of life for the company.

This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. \n\n\nOther fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. \nWhile waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nHave you been playing Sonic Frontiers?

Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review.

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. \nEven more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…",

          "description": "As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.\nStanding in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn't faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.\nComing off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.\nBut first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen. Read more...",

          "description": "Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo's history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.",

Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.\nThe smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …",

          "description": "A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon \"Emblems,\" characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

          "description": "Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. \nThis news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. \n\n\n\"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,\" Wingefores said in the statement. \"The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1.

While we would love to be one of those reviews, we're not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I've finished most of the main story, but I haven't fully explored the end and post-game content. \nHowever, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review.

The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. \nFor fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.\nPlayers represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.\n\n\nSince the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.",

Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
