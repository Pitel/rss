The Nintendo Switch Online Subscription service wasn't exactly blessed with a spotless reputation prior to the reveal of the premium tier, either. Though some of the YouTube downvotes may have been a joke from some, others have clearly felt that the offering is poor value, or perhaps object to Nintendo's approach to online services and retro games when compared to rival services on the market.\n\nNintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack Price, Games And Feature\n\nThe perspective on value is also, possibly, heavily dependent on whether you play and still enjoy Animal Crossing: New Horizons. As the premium tier includes the brilliant Happy Home Paradise expansion, it immediately offers a good deal if you want to dive into that content, especially if you take advantage of a Family Group to save money. If you're not a fan of Animal Crossing, though, the dynamic undoubtedly shifts as you're limited (at this point) to nine Nintendo 64 games and 14 SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis titles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This may sound like we’ve skipped straight to the end of this review a few paragraphs early but as it’s been a full decade since DoDonPachi Resurrection’s English Xbox 360 release, more than that since it debuted in Japanese arcades, and several years since its Steam port, there’s no point keeping anyone in suspense: this hypnotic mixture of bullets, lasers, and shiny collectibles is without a doubt one of the best of its type.\nIt’s also one of the most flexible of its type too, with eight very different ways to play and seven of those featuring extensive training options, allowing anyone to practise all levels, bosses, and even mid-bosses under any conditions imaginable. The options available go so far that, as with Espgaluda II, anyone who has a burning desire to display the main screen slightly off to the left at 107% magnification with the background image auto-changing every 38 seconds in one specific mode can do so if they wish.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Repent? But we just pented!!\nFantastic roguelite The Binding of Isaac has been around for a decade since its original Flash incarnation. On Switch alone it’s been a thing – along with its Afterbirth+ expansion – for over four years. A big, final addition to the game with the Repentance 'expansion', then, seems a little belated. Helpfully, Isaac is the kind of game that engenders obsession.\nThe further that Isaac moved from its original incarnation, the less balanced, and therefore the less fun, it became. It’s still ace, of course – by some distance it remains the king of the roguelites in this writer’s opiniom — but the bloat (not to be confused with boss monster The Bloat) introduced with each successive expansion made the game steadily more complex, less breezy, not as pick-up-and-play fun. Sure, you don’t expect to win every run in a game like this, but spawn The Haunt on the first floor with absolutely no power-ups and you may as well just restart.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Second time's the charm.\nSometimes it takes a few tries for a developer to properly execute their vision for a game. Just look at the original Metroid and then think of how it led to Super Metroid. It’s not that the original was bad, but it was a rudimentary initial take on what Yoshio Sakamoto really had in mind from the beginning. The same sentiment could apply to the BloodRayne series. Whereas the first BloodRayne was a sloppy attempt at doing an early character action game, BloodRayne 2 delivered a much more refined and enjoyable take on the formula. BloodRayne 2 unfortunately still isn’t a great game, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be lauded for the improvements it implemented.\nBloodRayne 2 takes place in modern times, so there are no secret Nazi squads to be found. Rather, the narrative is a much more personal tale of revenge. The plot centers around Kagan, Rayne’s vampire father, and the extensive family of bastard dhampir children he’s sired over the decades. This twisted ‘family’ has formed an organization called the Cult of Kagan, which aims to create a dark world where vampires can walk the earth freely. So, Rayne sets out on a quest to not only kill all her half-siblings, but to kill her father and enact revenge for him murdering her human mother. It’s not a terribly in-depth plot, but this story is nonetheless vastly improved from the confused and dull mess of its predecessor, as it features just the right mixture of camp and cool.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Despite being powered by technology that, even back in 2017, could hardly be described as cutting-edge, the hybrid system has shifted over 90 million units worldwide and shows no signs of slowing down as we move into 2022.\nEven so, Nintendo is savvy enough to know that continual hardware refreshes are a good way of maintaining momentum, and it has already iterated on the base Switch model twice (three times if you count the version with improved battery life). This year's OLED model is perhaps the most significant enhancement, bringing with it a larger, super-bright display, improved audio and superior build quality. However, the one thing that many people were hoping for is absent: more power under the hood.

Between Backbone, The Darkside Detective, and Unavowed, it's getting to be quite a beefy genre-within-a-genre.\nNow, to add to that pile, is Lacuna: A \"sci-fi noir\", which promises a number of features hoping to improve on a few of the point-and-click genre's worst habits. Pixel hunting? Nonsensical puzzle solutions? Being told \"X will remember that\" and then nothing really happening? Those are all things of the past, says Lacuna, calling these tropes \"baggage\" and highlighting their platformer movement controls and the ability to turn on outlines for interactable objects.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Whisper it.\nThe Legend of Zelda has celebrated its 35th Anniversary this year, with Nintendo releasing The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD along with the rather handsome Game & Watch. Interestingly, those releases alone have included two titles that can certainly be described as 'divisive' — we're thinking Skyward Sword's arm-waving controls (though the HD release has button options), and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link being that one that hardly anyone's beaten. Heck, there are people that say Breath of the Wild is overrated, even if this writer and a fair few others would happily die on a hill arguing in favour of its brilliance.\nZelda is a series that, partly because of the passion and love it fosters, also draws out strong opinions whatever route it follows. Some said Wind Waker was too cartoony, others said Twilight Princess wasn't bright enough. Some games are too traditional, or not traditional enough, or they're whatever Tri Force Heroes was (which could have been great with a few different design choices, arguably).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sweet moments where it's just you, an open country of undulating hillsides, and a truck full of trigger-happy marines. The developers have taken the eponymous second level of the first Halo, in which the big tin fella had to drive about helping his marooned space crew, and they've used it as a mood board for an entire game.

This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. \r\n\n\r\nThe patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.\r\n \nRead more",

Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she's written a message on the palm of her hand reading \"He is alive\". I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.\nRead more",

All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\nUnless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade.

That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn't win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn't rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I've ever played. \nRead more",

He's the dev behind the 2D platformers Starseed Pilgrim and Probability 0, and now Demon Deleter, a game in which you have to delete the names of a bunch of demons from a spreadsheet. It's a simple yet surprisingly fun idea that lets players hang out in this unusual shared space together. The inspiration behind it is pretty random too - droqen tells me he got the idea after spending hours cataloguing items for Animal Crossing. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.\r\n\n\r\nFor such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. \r\n\n\r\nSadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.\r\n \nRead more",

For the start of Chapter 3 – which begins today – developer Epic Games introduces a new gameplay movement through a character who knows it better than anyone.\nSpider-Man is joining the Battle Royale, and he's bringing his web-swinging techniques with him. Players can play as the Wall Crawler in three suits: his classic red and blue comic-book look, the white Future Foundation suit, or his symbiotic black alternate. One of the new locations on the redesigned map is the Daily Bugle, a tall building that should hold a few Spider-Man easter eggs for fans.\nClick here to watch embedded medi…",

Watch the video above to see the exciting climax featuring Jonesy and The Foundation. The island as we all know it has changed forever. Well, it's still there, just flipped or rotated. In the meantime, we're stranded in the ocean, left to await whatever adventures lie on the newly-inverted landmass, and what role The Foundation (now double confirmed to be Dwayne Johnson!) will play moving forward.\nOriginal Story: Epic Games is ending Fortnite's second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called \"The End.\"\nThis event is a one-time instance, meaning you won't be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.\nThe End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nWhat comes next is anyone's guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.\nWhat do you hope to see from Fortnite next? And what did you think of the current chapter?

          "description": "The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week, we're tackling the franchise's most reviled – or misunderstood – entry: Metroid: Other M. \nReleased for the Wii on August 31, 2010, Metroid: Other M saw Nintendo pass the development reins to Team Ninja, the studio most famous for the 3D Ninja Gaiden games. With a new developer came a drastic new vision for the series. A considerable emphasis on narrative gave Samus her first real speaking role (and boy does she talk) and the tale fleshed out her past life with the Galactic Federation.  We'll examine this polarizing narrative along with the development decisions behind Other M's blend of 2D and 3D gameplay.  \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, MinnMax cohort and former GI editor Kyle Hilliard (@KyleMHilliard) as we unpack the history and lore of Metroid: Other M. Is it as lousy history has led us to believe? Tune in to get our takes. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. \nBloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think this Spartacus service sounds like a true competitor to Xbox Game Pass?

It covers a mission titled \"A Place to Call Home\" that shows off plenty of traversal, fighting, NPC interactions, and how your choices affect The City, its residents, and Aiden's relationships.\nAt the tail end of the broadcast, it's announced that Techland is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and it's the one giving out the gifts! Starting today on GOG, you can pick up a $0.00 copy of 2001's Crime Cities, and next week Steam will be harboring a complimentary copy of Call of Juarez: Gunslinger to add to your library.\nFor more in-depth, hands-on impressions of Dying Light 2, please see your way to this New Gameplay Today and Brian Shea's piece on his time at the game's recent preview event.",

However, during the 2018 Game Awards, fans were treated to the announcement that an expanded version of the game, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, would arrive in 2019. It's now 2021, though developers Davey Wreden and Crows Crows Crows have always been the first to admit that window may have been wishful thinking. But after three years and a few sassy trailer updates, the game appears to be ready to ship – for real this time (hopefully).\nCrow Crows Crows announced on Twitter that The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is now content complete and is prepping to release it to consoles and PC in early 2022. This marks the first time the game will be available on consoles, though there’s still no mention of specific platforms. The game’s website only states the intention to release it to all platforms, basically. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFor those who missed the boat in 2013, you may be asking, “what exactly is The Stanley Parable?”. Good question, and unfortunately, it’s one of those games that’s best experienced as blindly as possible. But if you really need to know what you’re playing before committing cash to it (fair), you can read our review of the original game here.\nAre you a Stanley Parable fan looking to revisit the experience with Ultra Deluxe?

Recent updates, such as Update 3, which was revealed yesterday, indicate that EA is committed to improving the 2042 experience. Now, new shake-ups at the company provide further evidence that EA is doubling down on Battlefield as a core franchise. \nIn a new report by GameSpot, these shake-ups and changes are detailed, including news that Respawn Entertainment lead Vince Zampella, the person currently in charge of Apex Legends and other studio projects, is now the head of Battlefield.

Oddly enough, despite Amalur being available on the Switch, THQ Nordic’s press release about today’s Fatesworn news doesn’t mention the Switch when it comes to platforms for the expansion. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“This year on December 14, the journey of the Fateless One continues,” THQ Nordic’s press release reads. “After the Crystal War has been fought and Gadlow has been defeated, the people of Amalur were hoping for peace to return to their lands. And although peace has indeed come to Amalur, rumors of a new threat are starting to spread, rising in the far west, the icy lands of Mithros. None other than Telogrus, the God of Chaos himself has awoken and is gathering followers to throw the whole world into chaos.” \nTHQ Nordic says Fatesworn adds a whole new storyline to Amalur, a new environment to explore, multiple new quests and missions, new Chaos Realm dungeons, extra gameplay mechanics, more weapons and armor, never-before-seen enemies, and more. It will also raise the level cap of Amalur to 50 and it features a new soundtrack by composer Grant Kirkhope.\nYou must own the base Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning in order to purchase and play Fatesworn, which will be out on December 14. Perhaps more interesting than the content of Fatesworn is the fact that it’s an expansion for a game that came out 10 years ago. That’s quite unheard of in games, especially single-player ones.

The number one theory links The Foundation to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and for good reason – the character’s armor features a design that matches up nicely with Johnson’s tattoos. \nWe were all but confident that Johnson was The Foundation, but the actor’s new Twitter video today seems to finally confirm the role. Oddly enough, it comes by way of a ZOA energy drink ad in which Johnson is seen talking about ZOA while using words that match up with Fortnite – zero point, higher ground, foundation, and the universe, to name a few. \nLate night grind, POWERED BY @zoaenergy💥⚡️\n#ifyouknowyouknow 🦾 pic.twitter.com/admN7U9QKt\nDecember 2, 2021\nThen, as you can see above, he reaches into a fridge to grab a ZOA, and lo and behold, The Foundation’s helmet is sitting there. Of course, Johnson ignores it – cheeky – but then he returns right to using some Fortnite-centric words again. The tweet that accompanies his video also says “#ifyouknowyouknow” with a robotic arm beside it, so...uhh yeah, Johnson is The Foundation – we smell what you’re cooking. \nThe timing of this reveal is curious, too – Fortnite Chapter 3 is right around the corner. Perhaps The Foundation is primed to take on a more significant role in the battle royale’s story. Maybe we’ll hear Johnson’s voice as The Foundation in Chapter 3. Only time will tell for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out this trailer that shows Fortnite Chapter 2 is coming to an end before Chapter 3 launches sometime soon. Check out Game Informer’s Fornite review after that, and then give Game Informer’s list of all Marvel and DC characters in Fortnite a look. \nAre you excited to see what The Rock is cooking?

Director Masahiro Sakura also used this update to give thanks to everyone involved. \nバランス調整もこれで完了です。調整関係者各位、おつかれさまでした。\nhttps://t.co/10X7YREOnJ\nDecember 2, 2021\n“Balance adjustment is now complete,” Sakurai writes on Twitter. “Thank you to everyone involved in the coordination. The fighters used in the top-ranked battles and the average online win rate are all different, so I think this is a generally desirable distribution.” \nThe actual update features nearly 60 changes to character moves, spanning 24 different fighters. There are damage increases, speed boosts, animation length changes, and much more. You can check out the full update patch notes here. As noted by Kotaku, there are quite a handful of buffs – more buffs than nerfs, even – so many of your favorite fighters are probably feeling a touch stronger than usual. \nFor more about Ultimate, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Super Smash Bros.

One player, in particular, named “Sakana,” posted a ridiculous clip (seen below) to Twitter, showcasing the stopping power of one of the franchise’s most popular rifles. With one sniper bullet, 23 players are eliminated in mere seconds. \n23人抜きスナイパー　#HaloInfinite pic.twitter.com/AjCoGewbL1\nNovember 30, 2021\nImpressive, right? Sure, Sakana got a bunch of buddies to stand single-file, but the results are still cool as hell. Watching the kill-points increase and the red-hued damage indicator flash per each downed Spartan is pretty satisfying. The only highlight that could top this would be if 23 players somehow lined up inadvertently in the middle of a standard multiplayer match. Let’s see how many people load into big team battles in the hopes of achieving this legendary feat. Trust me, you’re more likely to get a 23-player killing spree by playing the game mode normally. \nThis isn’t the only wild thing that people have done in Halo Infinite. We’ve seen players grapple the vehicle bumpers as if wakeboarding … but without the board. We’ve learned that Spartans can lob fusion coils with NFL-level arm strength. The list goes on and on and will likely extend to Infinite’s single-player mode when it releases on December 8 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. \nIf you’re a Halo fanatic like we are, be sure to enter the Swarovski sweepstakes for this crystallized Master Chief helmet and energy sword. And if you’re not an Xbox Games Pass member, then you’re missing out as Ultimate subscribers are slated to get access to monthly multiplayer bonuses.  Those’ll go nicely with the extra six-match XP that 343 Industries implemented in its latest Halo update. \nThat 23-player killing spree was nuts, right?

You can check out both below: \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\n“In celebration of the game’s 20th anniversary and the launch of Halo Infinite, Xbox and Swarovski step into the epic sci-fi universe with two collectible crystal figurines,” Swarovski’s website reads. “A unique collaboration for both brands that serves as a reminder of what self-discovery and imagination can do. Created in an extremely limited-edition run, only the bold will reap their rewards. Enter your information below for a chance to win one of 117 [we see what you did there] Swarovski x Halo collectibles.” \nAs mentioned above, Swarovski is not selling these (we don’t even want to know what the price tag would be), and the only way to get your hands on one of 117 of these crystal figures is to enter the company’s drawing. You can register for that on the Swarovski site. \nWhile waiting to see if you win one of these crystal figurines, read about how Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get monthly Halo Infinite multiplayer bonuses starting next week and then read about how a new change in multiplayer makes it so that players earn increased XP for the first six matches played on any given day.

It turns out that “Ultimate DLC” was Project_Hel, the upcoming story-driven DLC where players will control Hel, one of the bosses from the game. Project_Hel will go live in January, but before that, some players will have the chance to go hands-on with it during a private beta held sometime before the DLC’s launch. \nHel will be a “combat-oriented character designed to appeal to ‘new players and veterans,’ and will feature her own ability progression system,” according to IGN. The story of Project_Hel will take place over six new missions that task Hel with descending from Dharma Tower, a locale heavily featured in the base game. Alongside new missions, Project_Hel will include new enemies, new bosses, and six new songs from Daniel Deluxe. \n505 Games told IGN that it was initially planned as a smaller DLC before becoming a “full-blown Ghostrunner experience.” It will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Amazon Luna on January 27. It will cost $14.99.\nThe studio also revealed that a new Holiday Pack would hit the game on December 7, and it’s a free cosmetics pack that includes holiday swords with matching gloves and more. \nWhile waiting for Project_Hel to launch in January, read about how native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Ghostrunner launched back in September. Then, check out this flashy neon pack that launched back in August alongside new assist options and a roguelike wave mode.

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop three times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as a cool camo option for your spartan and vehicles (see above).\nThe biggest bundle is the Anubis Armor Set for the Mark VII Spartan. This set offers the Arctic Void Epic Armor Coating, the Anubis Epic Helmet, a new visor and shoulder pads, and the rather mundane Vigilant Watch stance. It retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.\nThe most visually pleasing option in this week's offering is the Splinter Desert Epic Armor Coating that gives your Spartan a gray camo look. This texture can also be applied to all vehicles. This bundle is 1,500 credits.\nIf you love seeing your Spartan stand in generic poses, you can purchase the Tacticlamp 117 bundle to get another stance of a Spartan holding a pistol in a rather trivial way. The last item offered is the Reach Falcon Pilot Pack, consisting of a Falcon Nameplate and matching vehicle and weapon Emblems, along with new shoulder pads for your Spartan.

While her projectile assault may not be as direct as the Huntress’s ax or some of the other long-range options, her kit expands with add-ons and can be used to play keep away on pallets or windows that look prime for a chase. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nDepending on how she’s played, she can either use her artistic swarm to help track down survivors and keep tabs on them over long distances or be used for direct assault at close range. However, even more interesting and imp…",

          "description": "A new Starfield trailer today takes a bit of a different approach compared to the traditional sizzle reel or gameplay blast. Instead, you can take a look at Starfield in a very different fashion, with a behind-the-scenes look with game director Todd Howard, studio director Angela Browder, and art director Matt Carofano. It’s more of a micro look at Bethesda’s approach to their games, their stories, and their open worlds. It’s more of a conversational approach than a lot of game trailers, but it looks like it’s simply setting the stage for lots more to come regarding Starfield. Check out the full video right here.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThis is really just Episode One of a Starfield trailer series, so inevitably there will be a lot more on the way before Starfield’s release. In case you were wondering, Starfield is set to hit on November 11, 2022. That may seem like a long way off, but I’m sure we’ll get to see a lot more from the game as we progress into next year. Yeah yeah, I know. I want to see some serious gameplay slices too. We’ll get there. What do you think it’s going to be like? We do know some things… Expect wars, space pirates, and mysteries to unravel.\nAre you excited for Starfield? When do you think Elder Scrolls VI will launch?

          "description": "Media Molecule has announced Ancient Dangers: A Bat’s Tale, a new playable game the studio made in its 2019 creation game, Dreams.  \nThe game seems to be centered on two dungeon-crawling protagonists who must battle “hideous monsters” and solve “fiendish puzzles” to advance through Ancient Danger’s medieval setting. There is, of course, loot and wealth to be found throughout each of these dungeons, and there seems to be a cute bat at the center of its story, as the name alludes to. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Ancient Dangers looks quite great and it’s tough to picture it as a game made inside Dreams, which is itself a game. Credit to Media Molecule, though, for doing just that. Ancient Dangers looks great, too, which is especially exciting because it’s already out as of today. \nHere’s the official description for Ancient Dangers:\nAncient Dangers is a third-person dungeon crawler, featuring a single-player mode where players control Scoria, and a co-op mode, which adds Scoria’s twin, Gabbro, to the mix. The co-op mode is couch co-op only, though. Media Molecule says new PlayStation trophies have been added to Dreams for players to unlock while playing through Ancient Dangers, too, so if trophy hunting is your thing, you don’t want to miss this. \nFor more about Dreams, check out our thoughts on its release in Game Informer’s Dreams review. \nWill you be checking out Ancient Dangers: A Bat’s Tale?
