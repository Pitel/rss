Alas, the blow has been significantly softened by the reveal that Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will be making its way to the Switch on 20th March 2025.\nThe migration of Xenoblade Chronicles X from the Wii U to the Switch is pretty significant for two reasons. The first is that it now sits alongside Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (plus all the DLC) on one console, completing the set and making the Nintendo Switch the go-to platform for Monolith Soft's remarkable RPG series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Creating core memories.\nAbout a decade ago, not long after Minecraft was discovered by mainstream audiences, it felt like every other week you’d see another new sandbox survival project from developers both large and small looking to cash in on the craze. Now that’s been replaced by new trends like deckbuilders and extraction shooters, though there are still some worthwhile fresh sandbox releases to be found every now and then. One such game is Core Keeper, which has been in early access for the past two years on PC and only recently hit its 1.0 release state. Fortunately, the wait was worth it, as Core Keeper is deeply enjoyable and addictive.\nGameplay in Core Keeper follows the traditional survival-sandbox game template wherein you push out slowly from a rugged base of operations and slowly learn more about your world as you mine materials, fight enemies, and upgrade equipment in a constant battle against the overwhelming forces of nature.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The best 3D Sonic game..? Yes.\nHoly moly folks, Sega actually did it. After the disappointment of Sonic Forces, the glitchy mess of Sonic Colors Ultimate, and the divisive nature of Sonic Frontiers, the publisher has delivered what is undoubtedly the very best 3D Sonic game yet with Sonic X Shadow Generations. It gracefully revisits a beloved modern classic while introducing an extra campaign that we almost dismissed as a quaint bonus, but actually wound up being the star of the show.\nSince some Nintendo fans may not have experienced the console version of 2011’s Sonic Generations (with its release limited to the 3DS), the general gist is that ‘Classic’ and ‘Modern’ versions of the Blue Blur team up to take on an entity known as ‘The Time Eater’ after it merges their timelines and traps them within the mysterious ‘White Space’. The two must revisit iconic stages from the franchise’s history, with Classic Sonic zipping along a 2D plane and Modern Sonic boosting his way across 3D environments.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Nova say Nova Again.\nSome in the UK may know comedy TV personality Adam Buxton, who was once the counterpart of Joe Cornish in the Adam and Joe Show (1996-2001), and, as recently as 2020, was still guesting on popular Channel 4 panel shows. Nowadays, he's more well-known for The Adam Buxton Podcast, but in 1999 he walked into a London-based video game store where I was working as staff, and, retrieving a copy of Raiden DX from the Japanese PlayStation section, asked if I was familiar with it. I told him if he liked the series, it was by far the best entry and a superb arcade port full of bells and whistles. He immediately handed over the cash, wished me a good day, and left. I didn’t bother to say, “hey buddy, I watch you on TV”, but I was impressed with his gaming choice.\nRaiden, you see, is like a secret handshake amongst the shooting game hardcore, a distinguished Masonic-like fraternity of middle-aged men who get enthusiastic about blowing things up with spaceships. It’s known by many, but played seriously by few, and since its debut in 1990 its myriad sequels have been largely overlooked by the mainstream. Regardless, it’s an excellent series, from the Raiden Fighters spinoffs to the newer polygonal sequels. So, why the celebrity flex? Well, it left an impression. Not just because it was Adam Buxton, whose TV show was popular at the time, but because I never forgot that Adam Buxton was both a shoot-em-up player and Raiden fan. That was cool.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.\nRead more",

It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying \"the strangeness of organic life\". Also, chicken-legged houses.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation.

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a \"castle built of bitter memories\" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way \"through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps\".\nWhen not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.\n Read more",

It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.\nSo, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution.

All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs.

This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.\nRead more",

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.\nIt's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: \"{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?\" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release.

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Take a standard game of chance you might find in any casino and mash an uncountable number of bells and whistles and gizmos and weirdnesses into it, then slather it in a \"one more turn\" roguelike dressing, and make it as tactile and punchy as humanly possible. The ongoing Steam Next Fest has no shortage of these gambley gimmickers, but here's one demo that stood out. Ballionaire is a colourful pachinko-inspired roguelike, but you choose where the wacky widgets will go.\nRead more",

It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole.

Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability.

Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.\nIt also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.\nRead more",

          "description": "EA FC 25 players have run into a roadblock regarding their Ultimate Team experience. A new error is preventing the release of new live-service content, including SBCs.\n\n\nSquad Building Challenges are incredibly popular pieces of content as they allow players to get unique cards, packs, and more. Unfortunately, an unknown error seems to have occurred, which is preventing the addition of all forms of new content. EA Sports has acknowledged and notified the community, but things look pretty grim as of writing.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Ultimate Team error explained\n\n\nThere have been occurrences in the past when the planned content released by EA Sports hasn't gone as planned. The latest issue seems to have been caused by the switch from daylight savings. Usually, that shouldn't be a problem, as the content's release time remains at 6 p.m. UK Time. Unfortunately, no fresh content has been released as of writing, and it's already a few minutes past the deadline.\n\n\n\n\nNobody exactly knows what appears to be the problem. EA Sports has remained tight-lipped on the issue, but you can bookmark this tweet to stay updated on the situation. So far, only the Rush objectives have been renewed on October 29. However, there have been no special fodder SBCs or player SBCs as of writing.\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the issue will be fixed immediately or will take longer. Based on the rumors, we are supposed to get an RTTK/Total Rush Party Bag SBC very soon, which will assure you a promo item. Sadly, the Ultimate Team error has ruined the mood of many community members.\n\n\nOnce the issue is over and new SBCs are released, we will be back with detailed guides about their cheapest solutions. In the meantime, make sure to check out the solutions of the Max 88 Base Icon Upgrade and Max 88 Hero Upgrade SBC. These SBCs guarantee you an Icon and Hero card, respectively. \n\nThe post EA FC 25 Ultimate Team error stops the release of SBCs and live content appeared first on Destructoid.",

The start of the first season also marks the integration of Warzone into the new title, so the date is of prime importance. Till now, Activision has remained tight-lipped about when the new season will go live. Thankfully, an official confirmation is available regarding the release date. \n\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops Season 1 expected release date\n\n\nWe already had hints about the release date from a Little Caesar's promo, which reportedly set the release date of Season 1 at November 14. Now that we have confirmation, the first season is indeed going to be released on November 14. \n\n\nOnce Season 1 goes live, you'll be able to access the Battle Pass as well. It will be exciting to find out the exact content which will be part of the pass. As usual, there will be more rewards on the Premium version, which can be unlocked with tokens/Vault Edition upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nSeason 1 is supposed to introduce Area 99, and Activision has advised the players to unlock all their gears and strengthen them as much as possible. So far, there's no hint of the exact content coming as part of the new season. Players can expect plenty of free content, however, which will span across multiple modes. \n\n\nAdditionally, the much-hyped Omnimovement and the loadout system of Black Ops 6 will integrate with Call of Duty Warzone. If you're of the impatient type, November 1 marks the introduction of Nuketown to Black Ops 6. Additionally, the Infected mode is also coming to the game to celebrate Halloween. It's going to provide players with a different way to enjoy the undead, but you can always jump to the more traditional experience. \n\nThe post When will Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 1 start? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the opening night live event at August's Gamescom, Grinding Gear Games revealed plans to bring Path of Exile 2 to Early Access on November 15. Things have changed, though, and folks who have been eagerly awaiting this one will need to hold out a little longer.\n\n\nAccording to Grinding Gear's latest update on the project, Path of Exile 2's Early Access release has been delayed to December 6, 2024. Game director Jonathan Rogers shared the news in a video on the game's official website and social channels, starting off with a quick intro and an apologetic announcement. \n\n\n\"Unfortunately, I have some really bad news. We have to delay Early Access for three weeks,\" he began. He addressed the fact that people even tend to plan time off for their launches, but said they \"just have to do it.\" \n\n\n\n\nAs Rogers noted in the video, the game itself isn't the issue at hand. The delay came about as the result of \"a bunch of server-side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.\" \n\n\nSome of this has to do with fulfilling the promise that all microtransactions will work across Path of Exile 1 and 2. To pull that off, they have to integrate the account systems for both games, as well as the platforms. A bunch of new systems had to be created in the process, all of which needed to be backward compatible with the old data. \n\n\nHe said that while he was actually confident they could have made the original launch date, he wasn't certain they could do it without making mistakes. \"When you're migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there,\" Rogers added. \n\n\nThe only strange demons we're looking to battle are the ones in the game, and it sounds like this will hopefully be the last snag before we can do so. Beyond that, the team will also have a livestream to talk about all the content players can expect in Early Access in \"about four weeks.\"  \n\nThe post Path of Exile 2 Early Access gets pushed back three weeks appeared first on Destructoid.",

Having only just come out via Steam Early Access, Sulfur follows up on its excellent April demo with a surprisingly content-heavy beta launch. Notably, the aforementioned demo is still around!\n\n\nIf you'd forgive my excitement, it's not often that I get so taken aback by an Early Access release.

Happily, it's just happened, and to celebrate the occasion, game director Joe Ziegler chimed in on how the development is going and what Marathon is.\n\n\nZiegler's vlog comes in at just under 10 minutes' worth of runtime and I recommend it for anyone even remotely interested in Marathon. On top of the obvious boon that is an honest-to-goodness explanation of Marathon's core gameplay loop, Ziegler also said that Bungie's been executing some \"aggressive [changes]\" on Marathon over the past couple of years. Promising news? Perhaps, but Ziegler also essentially confirmed that Marathon's Runners will be pre-existing character archetypes instead …",
