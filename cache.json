It's been a great year for Switch releases, with a crop of excellent first-party Nintendo games joined by some great third-party offerings (Square Enix, in particular, has been on fire the last few months), plus choice ports of older titles and more incredible indies than we know what to do with.\nWhile our Top 50 reader-ranked list of the Best Switch Games of 2022 serves as the main course in our GOTY rankings (and will be published soon!), we also publish an annual NL staff GOTY list. Typically, we compile all nominations in a spreadsheet, and then everyone on staff adds points in reverse order for their top 10 games of the year, which is then tabulated to create our 10 staff picks. This is fine but a) it tends to produce a crop very similar to our reader-ranked counterpart, and b) smaller games — ones that rank very highly on our personal lists — usually get pushed off the bottom by familiar big-name fare, despite the passion they inspire in individual team members.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In an interview with Famitsu (translated by Ryoktuya2089 via Gematsu), Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo said that the company wants to release three \"refined\" titles in total, following the announcement of Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana.\nPreviously, Kondo has gone on record stating that up to the end of September 2023, Falcom wants to release three titles for the Switch. Ys Memoire, the enhanced rerelease of the 2010 PSP action RPG Ys: The Oath in Felghana, is due to launch on the Switch in Spring 2023, meaning the remaining two titles Kondo is teasing will likely be coming to Switch.

          "description": "Pale imitation.\nDescribed by developer Condradical as \"Paper Mario + Undertale\" on the game's Kickstarter page, The Outbound Ghost garnered some attention with its aesthetic and gameplay along with its premise: the residents of the town of Outbound all quite suddenly died. Many of them have lingering burdens that keep them from moving onto the afterlife. You initially assume the role of an amnesiac ghost as he explores the town, meeting its spectral residents and uncovering a bit by bit what exactly happened. It sounds grim, sure, but it’s all wrapped up in a cutesy package that never devolves too much into the macabre. The game has finally arrived (though not without drama between Conradical and publisher Digerati) and can be played on a Nintendo platform, as all papery RPGs should.\nIf you’ve played Paper Mario before, the gameplay loop is quite similar. While exploring the areas around Outbound, touching a malevolent enemy in the overworld will trigger a turn-based battle. In battle you control four of a selection of figments of your own psyche – Solitude, Spite, Comradery, and so on – that manifest themselves as party members. Attacks are reflex-based, with an improperly timed button press resulting in a miss and a perfectly timed one increasing damage.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that's a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it's oh so satisfying.\nWe've written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.\nRead more",

It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.\nYaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.\nRead more",

Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. \nThe world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to \"challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,\" Dyankov tells me. \"Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.\" I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.\nRead more",

You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases.

Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you'll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again.

The talking alien guns weren't that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you'll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.\nHaving now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it's a shame the FPS side can't match it.\nRead more",

And that's because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn't show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.\nBUT, I'd argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn't a life investment, and that's rad.\nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier this year I watched a very short presentation of Inkbound, an upcoming turn-based roguelike from Shiny Shoe, the devs behind deckbuilder Monster Train. I thought it had potential, but it's difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you've got to go on is footage they'd prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.\nI'm excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe's CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game's speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.\nRead more",

          "description": "Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.\nSeveral of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.\nJames: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.\n Read more",

You might have an amazing initial idea, but as you put it into action, whether writing a book, drawing a picture, or making a game, you might discover that you can do better than that first idea. And that's okay. It's all part of the process. Just ask Ken Levine.\nBut sometimes, you get lucky, and the first idea you have knocks it out of the park. That's what happened with Second Dinner, the developers behind Destructoid's pick for the Best Mobile Game of 2022. As studio co-founder Ben Brode told the Washington Post in October:\n\"We came up with the idea for ‘Marvel Snap’ pretty quickly.

The Artdink-developed RPG launched on Nintendo Switch last spring, and recently received a sales boost thanks to the release of a PC port in October.\nA turn-based tactical affair, Triangle Strategy is one of the more recent offerings from RPG veteran Tomoyo Asano, producer of such gems as Octopath Traveler and the Bravely Default franchise. The story concerns the war-torn continent of Nozelia, as three countries continue a violent conflict that has raged for some three decades. The player guides noble protagonist Serenoa Wolffort as they, (and their compatriots) attempt to negotiate the machinations of a world at war.\nTo celebrate the sales milestone, Square Enix has announced a limited-time 40% off sale for the PC edition, now live on Steam. So if you're yet to get involved in the power and politics of Triangle Strategy, now presents an opportunity for you to get into the thick of the action for almost half of the retail price! While the Nintendo Switch release is also mentioned in the tweet as being part of the discount, the eShop is currently listing this edition at full price.\nhttps://twitter.com/TRST_PR/status/1605474401847193601?s=20&t=1ydJLa6Hu55QJydhonIf3w\nThe post Triangle Strategy celebrates one million sales milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players take part in a challenging race against time, as stranded space explorers who must quickly and efficiently mount a defense against enormous waves of aliens and monsters. Simple in concept but hugely compelling, Risk of Rain would go on to sell over four million copies and be the recipient of several awards within the creative sphere.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXNUXEfNvc\nRisk of Rain Returns is a fully revised version of the original game, which features remastered visuals, (well, as much as you can \"remaster\" 8-bit graphics), 15 unique Survivor classes, 10 run-altering Artifacts, and fully overhauled multiplayer modes — featuring support for one-to-four players in online and local co-op action. While the game itself is now approaching its 10th anniversary, the Risk of Rain gameplay remains as frenzied and engrossing today as it was a decade ago. Time to get lost, all over again.\nRisk of Rain Returns launches in 2023 on PC and Nintendo Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PivWxDUHlhw&t\nThe post Remaster Risk of Rain Returns headed to Switch in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's crazy to think how many things have changed since then, Fallout 76 included! It's gone from one of the biggest AAA disasters in recent memory to a respectable main/side game for many. This week, Bethesda released a \"2022 retrospective\" of sorts, complete with an infographic.\nAs is usually the case with these things, the info therein ranges from useful to silly. The main stat is that 13.5 million players engaged with the game in 2022 (keep in mind it's on Game Pass, and was offered for free several times): and from there, it gets a little more inside baseball.\nIf you play the game, you might find some of the other useless stats humorous, like the thumbs up taking the crown as the most popular emote, or the fact that there's been 2.9 million nukes dropped. Oh, and that folks prefer forest locations for setting up their camps/home base. \"Boiled water\" taking the top spot as the most prepared food/drink (combined!) is also funny to me.\nWith the massive Pitt update in the rear view and the new season afoot, folks are wondering what 2023 has in store for Fallout 76. Hopefully it still includes some combination of free access via Game Pass, as well as a healthy mix of smaller/bigger patches.\nA great big Fallout 76 2022 recap:\n\nThe post Fallout 76 is still alive and kicking, based on this infographic appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Gothic anime actioner will launch on PC and console platforms on February 23, 2023.\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge sees two young sisters venture into a foreboding castle on a quest to purge their school from its demonic presence. One or two players control older sister Shinobu, who is locked and loaded with a crazy arsenal of long-range weaponry, and her younger sibling Maya, who has mastered the deadly art of... erm... origami. Combining the destructive capabilities of the former with the precision and adaptation of the latter, our two heroes will head deeper into the grim locale, battling a gallery of monsters, ghoulies, and terrifying and unholy boss characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7uWrjl95k4&t\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge looks to combine the run-and-gun action of the 1990s with the classic Gothic overtones of the Castlevania series, dressed up in a pleasing anime cheese aesthetic. An array of secrets, weapons, and spells await, while a \"Style\" based scoring system will reward those who utilize a sense of fluidity in their relentless monster-mashing. Sporting delightful pixel-based visuals and classic arcade sound, Grim Guardians simply looks like good, unabashed fun, particularly in co-op, and has quickly found its way onto my radar for the first quarter of the coming year.\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge launches February 23, 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Grim Guardians: Demon Purge brings anime action February 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "And the \"biggest 3rd Party Game Pass launch ever\"\nOver on the Game Pass charts (on both PC and console), I noticed that High on Life was jumping up quickly after launch. But today, Microsoft fully confirmed my inkling: the game is a bona fide success on Game Pass.\nThe Squanch Games release was apparently \"Xbox Game Pass’ biggest launch of 2022,\" as well as \"the biggest 3rd party Game Pass launch of all time, and the biggest release of a single player-only game in the service’s history.\" Where does Microsoft actually get those stats? They're based on the \"number of hours played in the first five days of release.\" In both an email to Destructoid and on the Xbox Wire blog itself, Microsoft uses the phrase \"millions of players\" to describe the userbase playing right now.\nDespite my misgivings with the game, as I pointed out in my review, High on Life might be the the most ideal Game Pass game to date (especially since it has a $60 MSRP). It's so janky that you'd possibly be pissed if you spent $60 on it, but on a lark as an \"extra\" on Game Pass, it's great to dive into with no context as patches roll out for it.\nNot only that, but given that so much of High on Life is based on Roiland's subjective sense of humor, you may not even enjoy the entire vibe altogether. While many of those jokes are hit or miss, one of the best things about it is the \"90s adventure game\" feeling it has, Easter eggs and meta-references and all. I wish it had a bit more polish, but it's great to see Squanch Games getting a win either way.\nThe post Microsoft says High on Life is 2022’s biggest Game Pass launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first and foremost of these tributes will be a full \"visual adaptation\" of the original 2000 manga series. This cinematic project will be produced by veteran anime studios Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga, and ANIMA, and is scheduled to premiere in 2023. Bandai Namco's insistence on referring to the production as a \"visual adaptation\" rather than a \"film\" or an \"anime\" leaves a few questions up in the air. but we'll just have to wait and see.\nYou can check out a teaser trailer for the adaptation below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--plyeEv4Ag&t=53s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nAs we previously recanted, Sand Land was dystopian adventure series set within a world that had become almost entirely desert, with water becoming the single most important form of currency. With his local town dry as a bone, aging sheriff Rao teams up with Prince of Demons Beelzebub (no, really), and impish mischief maker Thief on an odyssey to uncover the location of the legendary Phantom Lake and return a source of hydration to his hometown.\nWhile the visual adaptation is the only endeavor revealed by Bandai Namco so far, the publisher suggests that it has other creative projects in the works, with more reveals to be made across 2023, given the studio's interest, it's not hard to imagine that there may be a Sand Land video game in the works. For now, we're just going to have to hold fast and keep our tanks gassed up and ready to rock.\nIn the meantime, you can check out the official Project Sand Land website right here.\nThe post Project Sand Land is a ‘visual adaptation’ of the cult Toriyama manga appeared first on Destructoid.",

When it arrives on Xbox and Steam, it'll go for $39.99. That will include the free updates the game has received in the time since launch, including the recent fall update with a Replay Editor and the upcoming Arenas mode update.\nArenas mode, which will be part of a free update this spring, will add nine new maps with special challenges. Completing the arena challenges will unlock new modifiers, as well as add some alternative moves to the protagonist's arsenal. It's always nice to have some extra tricks up your sleeve when enacting your vengeance, right? The Arenas will also unlock new cheats and special new outfits, too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW_4aIEV3Q\nOn a quest for revenge\nSifu was one of the earlier hits of 2022, arriving just at the start of February. Following a martial arts student whose master is slain by a rival organization. As the student, you go on a quest for vengeance, fueled by a magical artifact that lets you spring back to life at the cost of years of your life.\nIt's a really fun brawler, and fitting follow-up to Sloclap's previous game Absolver.

As a recap, Blizzard posted the following Twitter message on October 10: \"Bastion and Torbjörn will be taking a quick trip to the workshop while we iron out a few bugs in their ability kits! Bastion will be unavailable in all modes during this time, while Torbjörn will still be playable in Quick Play.\" Bastion in particular was able to exploit his ultimate, leading to a swift recall of the hero.\nBastion was added back to the game on October 25, and joins a line of heroes (among other things like at least one map) that were removed from the game due to bugs.\nThe post You can get this nearly-free Legendary Gingerbread Bastion skin in Overwatch 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Two more shadowdrops have arrived, as well as two announcements of upcoming games slated for 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qXjO6eQm34\nFirst up, the play-it-now games for today. The Captain is a new narrative adventure from Sysiac Games and Tomorrow Corporation. You play a lost science officer from the space fleet, trying to work their way back home with some precious info. Lots of choices wait to be made, as well as big space battles to get caught up in.\nIf penguins are more your style, The Punchuin is a new game from The Touryst team Shin'en. You play as a penguin who punches things, and is trying to see all there is to see on Punch Mountain. It's part match-three puzzle, and part-charming exploration and adventure, but all punchy penguin.\nForecast calls for more rain\nTwo more games got revealed today too, locking in for a 2023 launch window. The first is The Gecko Gods, a puzzle platformer from Inresin and Super Rare Originals. It asks, \"what if a gecko could explore a mysterious and dangerous island?\" It's all in the pursuit of saving their friend, who I hope is also a small and adorable gecko. That's set to arrive in 2023.\nA popular roguelike is also on the way back, too. Risk of Rain Returns is a remastered version of the original Risk of Rain from Hopoo Games and Gearbox Publishing. It looks to have all the 2D chaos of the original, but with a new coat of paint and apparently new ways to play in store too. The rain returns in 2023.\nThere are still three days left this week in Nintendo's House of Indies advent calendar. Tune back in tomorrow morning for the next bout of indie surprises for the Switch.\nThe post Nintendo’s House of Indies Day 2 has punchy penguins and a risk of rain appeared first on Destructoid.",

Camera in hand, the player simply strolls around towns, beaches, and cityscapes, getting snap-happy on any and all four-legged friends that cross their path. Build up a portfolio of the finest puppy pics online and then bask in the glory of upvotes and having your pics turned into NFTs (That last bit doesn't happen).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j_0yGFPSQo&ab_channel=KitfoxGames\nPupperazzi features a wide variety of Good Boys and Girls, including terriers, pugs, labradors, shibas, and so many more. And, when not taking great photos, you can pet your new doggie pals, play fetch, dress them up (if you're terrible), arrange parties, and enjoy various other activities. Don't forget to take them *checks notes* skateboarding. As you receive acclaim for your pupperazzi skills, you'll also get the opportunity to upgrade your camera equipment — buying new filters, lenses, and effects. It's all very charming and wholesome, and most certainly a stress-free way to unwind on a lazy afternoon.\nPupperazzi launches in early 2023 on Nintendo Switch. It is available now on PC and Xbox One.\nThe post Pupperazzi will come barking onto Switch in early 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I assume some of you out there are gifting hardware to relatives or immediate family members, and with modern hardware comes a certain degree of responsibility. Yep, updates! This Reddit thread from Letmeplat reminded me of something really important: consider updating your hardware before you gift it.\nOften times, Christmas day servers explode with demand\nI think it was the 3DS era that I started thinking about updating gifts ahead of time. It had gotten to the point where nearly everything needed a hefty amount of firmware updates: on top of game updates. I think the worst experience I've ever had with this was updating my PS3 after a long hiatus. The PSN would take hours to download each update, and would turn around and download an update on top of that update. It was exhausting, and would just leave it running all day.\nAs an extra tip: if your console comes with a free game like Mario Kart, consider updating that too. Or as a matter of fact, consider updating any game you're gifting. With few exceptions (like The Witcher 3 fitting on one Switch cart), many games require huge updates to even play, which could mean wait times, or bugged out servers preventing someone from downloading a crucial day one patch.\nOf course, you could also leave it to the giftee to do it, especially if you're aiming to give them a sealed copy. It's your choice!\nThe post PSA: If you’re gifting gaming hardware for Christmas, think about updating it first appeared first on Destructoid.",

Originally launched in March of 2021 on iOS and Android platforms, Crash and pals will make their final dash in February 2023, when the servers are shut off permanently.\n\"Crash fans, it’s with a heavy heart that we inform you on February 16, 2023 we will terminate service for Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!\" wrote King in a message on Facebook. \"It has meant so much to bring your favourite Crash characters to life and we've sincerely loved making this game. Thank you for spending your time with us and we hope you will join us in one of our many other games.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KETsS3nkwBw&ab_channel=IGN\nThe in-game store is closed, effective immediately, and players are encouraged to use up any of the \"Purple Crystals\", (On the Run's in-game currency), before the closing date. The news has come as something of a surprise to some in the runner's community, as there had been whispers that On the Run! might actually have been preparing for a full relaunch in the new year. The game had previously been delisted from stores, with the developer saying that the removal was due to a \"bug\".\nDedicated fans of the title have also expressed dismay that a game they have spent money on over the past 23 months will suddenly be rendered completely unusable. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the risk that comes with frequent spending within modern service titles. Many, many mobile titles have pulled down the blinds on the player communities, regardless of whether the fans are financially invested, and refunds are rarely forthcoming, if ever.\nCrash Bandicoot: On the Run! is not the first game to call it quits in the early going, and it absolutely will not be the last.\nThe post Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! shutting service after two years appeared first on Destructoid.",

If that sounds like you, make sure to check out Humble Bundle's insane end of year sale, because they have some seriously awesome stuff on there. They have hundreds of games and DLC marked down, including fan favorites like God of War, Hollow Knight, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, Dying Light 2, Signalis, Deathloop, and Psychonauts 2, just to name a few.\nThe discounts range anywhere from 10% to 75% off, and I can say as a fan that I was very pleasantly surprised to see some of these games at such low prices. For example, they have Slime Rancher for $5 right now! One of my all-time favorite and most played games Slay the Spire is under $10. You could buy like four games for $20 and be good for the next month or two -- that's pretty good if you ask me.\n\nHonestly Humble Bundle has been one of my favorite ways to buy new titles as a baby gamer -- considering I don't usually need to play the newest titles as they drop because I'm still trying to catch up on the best games from like four or five years ago, I find that they always have a great sale going on for something in my backlog.\nNot only do they have cool sales and pre-packaged bundles of games you can get, but Humble Bundle is also known for using their sales to support all kinds of amazing charities like Charity: Water, Girls Who Code, and One Tree Planted, among others. Since the site's founding back in 2010, they've managed to raise over $200,000,000 for charity through their sales and monthly subscription.

          "description": "An indie advent calendar for Switch owners\nNintendo is ringing in the holidays with a special event spotlighting independent games. The Inside the House of Indies Holiday Event starts today and runs through this Friday, highlighting new and upcoming indie games headed for the Nintendo Switch.\nEach day of this week, Nintendo will upload a new video at 9 a.m. PT. Each one will shine a light on updates, announcements, and news from Nintendo's indie partners.\nFor a good example of what to expect, today's Day 1 spotlight features two new games and two upcoming launches. First up are Floppy Knights, a deckbuilding tactics game with a very charming art style, and Mortal Shell, a grim Souls-alike, both making their way to Nintendo Switch today.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMjdUHrjYLs\nThose two are out now, but two more games were revealed for the Switch's future slate. One is a port of Pupperazzi, the adorable photo sim game about taking pictures of pups around town, arriving in early 2023. The other is a new game from Paratopic creators Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build. Set in a decrepit facility as the world ends, it has quite the laundry list of genres, including visual novel, adventure, puzzle solving, horror, and survival simulation. Sounds right up my alley.\nA holiday of indies\nThat's just day one for the House of Indies. But Nintendo has four more days of news lined up, running now through December 23. There's still quite a bit more to reveal, and at least anticipated game that's had a December window already set.\nWhile it's a bit different from an Indie World Showcase or something, I kind of dig this model. Games get their own day to thrive, and each new video can be a little surprise. With lots of travel and holiday time in the near-future, I imagine a couple indie games to while away the hours are a welcome surprise-drop for Switch owners too.\nThe post Nintendo is hosting a House of Indies holiday event throughout this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

From its initial announcement, FromSoftware's next release had the fanbase practically frothing at the mouth. Convinced, purely off the back of the studio's pedigree, that something genre-defining was on the march. And, to the surprise of nobody, when launch day came, Elden Ring delivered.\nAnd how.\nPlayers were immediately enraptured by The Lands Between, falling into some sort of strange love affair with its oppressive grimness, frightening environments, and skin-crawling giant spider hands. Eager gluttons for punishment, players gladly submitted themselves to the lash of Elden Ring's whip, sad…",

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_VMGv2kKEI\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.</p>\n\n<p>Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.</p>\n\n<p>So this is it. If you spent your childhood following&nbsp;Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his&nbsp;entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!</p>",

Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px\">A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled)&nbsp;note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6316859818112\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.&nbsp;</p>",

Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.</p>\n\n<p>Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come&nbsp;to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>",

His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll \"cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6316852832112\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2022/09/13/tekken-8-officially-revealed-in-new-cinematic-trailer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series&nbsp;X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Are you excited for Tekken 8? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p>",

          "description": "Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!\nPublished in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. \nA new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.\nWhether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!\nYou must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.\nOnly Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.\nCurrently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered.

          "description": "Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker",
