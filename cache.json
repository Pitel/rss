To make matters even wilder, it was a pseudo-edgy re-imagining of decades of Disney iconography with forgotten mascot Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as a central antagonist.\nAnd yet Epic Mickey happened, and what’s perhaps even more unbelievable, given the complications of re-releasing licensed games, is that 14 years on we’d be getting a remade version of the game. But, following the remake of the certified banger Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, Purple Lamp is taking the helm of an updated edition of Mickey Mouse’s Wii adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.\nRead more",

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.\nRead more",

Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.\n Read more",

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings.

A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider.

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's \"curse\" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below. \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The mountain biking of Lonely Mountains: Downhill was sometimes a relaxing ride down gentle slopes, and at other times a hairy hurtle down declivitous cliffs. Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.\nRead more",

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature.

It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic.

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

          "description": "United Label and Odd Bug Studio have announced that Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter, the sequel to their 2021 action-RPG, will be released in February 2025 for PC and consoles. This is technically a delay from their planned 2024 release, but only slightly.\n\n\nFor some reason, rodents make the best fantasy protagonists, as proven by Redwall and Ghost of a Tale. Writing for Destructoid at the time, Chris Moyse gave the first Tails of Iron a 7.5 in a review laced with praise, calling it “one of the year’s most distinctive RPG experiences.”\n\n\nTails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter moves the action far to the north. You play as Arlo, “heir to the Warden of the Wastes.” The game is a sidescrolling, soulslike, dark fantasy game. After the Frog/Rat war, Bats rise up as a threat. Arlo has to travel the northern wastes in an effort to “Hunt down giant beasts. Unite disparate clans. Upgrade your settlement. And discover a terrible secret of blood and crown…” Rad.\n\n\n\n\nMoyse’s review got me interested in Tails of Iron, but I have to be honest with you: it occupies this space that is high enough to make me consider buying it but low enough on my priorities where I’m not sure I’ll ever play it. The side-scroller genre is so packed these days. I can barely even look at a game with “metroidvania” in the description. I don’t hate these types of games; it’s just that I’ve played so many of them throughout my life that it’s hard to get excited. I don’t have time between games that have seized my attention anymore. Once I finish one, it’s onto another. Though, truly, I’m often playing multiple games in tandem; alternating between them.\n\n\nWhat I’m saying is that Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter looks great. You should play it, and then I’ll live vicariously through your experience.\n\n\nTails of Iron 2 releases in February 2025 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Rodent-positive action-RPG Tails of Iron 2 releases in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In WoW: The War Within, Brax, the Innkeeper of Gundargaz, The Ringing Deeps, has lost his trusty pair of Brass Knuckles and tasks you to retrieve them. The only problem is, the area where he wants you to search is huge, so here's exactly where you can find them.\n\n\nWhere is Brax's Brass Knuckles in WoW: The War Within?\n\n\nDespite the enormous search area, Brax's Brass Knuckles aren't as difficult to find as the quest makes them appear. When I first looked at the map, I assumed it would be a small, interactable object hidden somewhere in the vast quest area that I'd need to keep an eye out for. Turns out, it's nothing like that. Brax's Brass Knuckles were picked up by one of the various fungal lifeforms roaming The Ringing Deeps. This quest is a 'kill and loot' quest in disguise, as all you need to do to actually find his knuckles is slay a whole bunch of them.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSpecifically, the enemies you want to look for are all plant life in The Ringing Deeps. The ones you want to keep a look out for are the following:\n\n\n\nUnderdrip Crwaler\n\n\nCrawler Sproutling\n\n\nDisturbed Kelp\n\n\nDisrupted Slime\n\n\nSweetnuffler\n\n\nCreeping Lashroom\n\n\n\nAll these beasts can be found roaming the questing area, and defeating them gives you a good chance of finding Brax's Brass Knuckles on their corpse. From my experience, the drop rate seems fairly high—you’re likely to get them within 10 kills. Once you’ve acquired the knuckles, you'll still need to complete the second part of Brax's quest to turn them in, but this should help you get past the most unpredictable step of the process.\n\nThe post Where to find Brax’s Brass Knuckles in WoW: The War Within appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're jumping into new expansion now, here's everything you need to know about the process.\n\n\nHow to get Hero Talents in WoW: The War Within\n\n\nWhen you enter the game with the expansion enabled, if open your Talent Tree, you'll see a third new tree in the middle of the screen. These are your Hero Talents, but they are locked until you meet two key conditions, neither of which are difficult to achieve. \n\n\nTo unlock them, make sure you have The War Within purchased and have begun the new campaign questline.  The campaign takes you to the ancient lands of Khaz Algar, and you're required to go there to unlock your Hero Talent tree.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAfter that, all you need to do is reach level 71, and the new talents will automatically unlock. Simply questing in The War Within should provide more than enough experience to get you there. As you level up from 70 to 80, you’ll earn one Hero Talent point per level, which can only be used on the Hero Talent tree of your choice. \n\n\nUnlike previous new systems in WoW, there’s no additional questline, trigger, or condition needed to unlock these talents, which is a bit surprising. Still, by following these two straightforward steps, you’ll be able to fully enjoy the new Hero Talents. Like normal talents, Hero Talents can be respecced free of charge, so feel free to play around with and experiment with your class's new powers.\n\nThe post How to unlock Hero Talents in WoW: The War Within appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sega was a big player in the arcade industry during the ‘80s, but they had trouble breaking into the home console market. The Master System was mired in difficulties, but almost through sheer marketing, it was able to make a sizeable dent in the North American market with the Sega Genesis in 1989.\n\n\nMine was a Nintendo household growing up. But surprisingly, in my youthful days on the schoolyard, we never really argued about what was the better console between the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. I don’t know why. It just didn’t matter at my school. Besides, I was spending a lot of time on my cousin’s Genesis right around the corner.\n\n\nOver the past couple of decades, I’ve grown an affection for Sega’s classic console, helped in part by the distinctive tones of its FM Synth sound chip.

          "description": "Pet collectors of World of Warcraft have a relatively unique way to earn a new pet starting today. All they have to do is stream their World of Warcraft adventures to their friends in Discord. \n\n\nAfter 15 minutes of streaming WoW to their pals, players will be eligible to claim this pet. This promotion is running until September 8.\n\n\nFor those who haven't seen these before, Discord has a quest system that lets you claim rewards for certain games. It's a fancy promotional tool, but one that can let players nab unique rewards. In Discord, you can view Quests under the Discover tab; find the quest you want, and select Accept.\n\n\nOnce you've accepted the quest, stream World of Warcraft to at least one other person for 15 minutes. Once you're done, you can claim your reward from the quest page. In this case, it's a unique pet. Parrlok is a chunky little cyclopean ogre with a distinct sort of charm. It's a one-of-a-kind pet, as the only other like it is a recolored pet named Garrlok. That one has only been offered in the Trading Post, so there's currently no way to get it unless he cycles back in.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nParrlok isn't just for looks, though. He's a potential new member of your Battle Pet team as well. He's a humanoid with decent health stats, and comes with \"Cute as a Button.\" It's a rare skill for Humanoid battle pets to have, increasing their dodge chance to 33% for 2 rounds. Combined with \"Stoneskin,\" he's quite the little tank.\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft: The War Within is available for early access now, and releases on August 26 worldwide. You can check out all of our continuing guides and coverage here.\n\nThe post Get an exclusive Parrlok pet in World of Warcraft by streaming on Discord appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After almost two years, the sandbox adventure game Core Keeper will finally come out of Early Access. With its full launch, there are plenty of new features to behold, unraveling the secrets of the ancient Core. We're here to dig into Core Keeper 1.0's release date and unveil upcoming content.\n\n\nCore Keeper 1.0 release date and features\n\n\nCore Keeper 1.0 will be released on Aug. 27, 2024. This date also marks the game's official console debut, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. According to the Nintendo page, the title will also launch on the Switch on Sept. 17, 2024.\n\n\nThe Core Keeper 1.0 content reveal trailer confirms a new and customizable world generation feature, allowing you to explore your favorite biomes. Plus, you can try out the two new combat styles: Warlock and Mage. Explore a unique magic system that requires the power of mana and unlock additional skills for character builds. You'll also uncover a new talent tree for Magic and Summoning, which helps with attack damage and mana regeneration. \n\n\n\n\nThe developer, Pugstorm, has given us the deets on Core Keeper's co-op and cross-platform availability. While online multiplayer continues to be worked upon, there are no plans for local co-op or cross-platform support. On the other hand, multiplayer will be revamped for PC crossplay as the team looks into the new PlayFab Party.\n\n\nIf you've played Core Keeper in Early Access, Pugstorm recommends starting a new world to make the 1.0 experience run smoothly. Any old worlds will be renamed as \"Classic,\" indicating that it is an unsupported version for the full release. You can still access these builds afterward, but they won't include 1.0 content.\n\n\nImage via Pugstorm\n\n\nOnce Core Keeper 1.0 arrives, more updates will roll out to expand the magical universe. That means you can anticipate new content and quality-of-life improvements in the near future.\n\nThe post When does Core Keeper 1.0 come out? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Liberty Falls cinematic unveils an exclusive first look at Edward Richtofen's return, bringing the Wunderwaffe along for the ride. \n\n\nThe cinematic begins with a nightmarish series of events as Richtofen horrifically dreams about death and destruction. If you've been a longtime fan of the Black Ops series, you'll likely notice the familiar voice talents of Nolan North. Although his role hasn't been confirmed yet, fans are already buzzing in the comments about his return. His comeback isn't too surprising, given that North has been teasing Richtofen's comeback. \n\n\n\n\nOnce Edwards wakes from the nightmare, we return to the early '90s and step into the upcoming Liberty Falls map. Like all Zombies storylines, things go haywire when a mysterious entity threatens the world. The classic Wunderwaffe makes its grand appearance here, as Richtofen uses it to electrify the undead. This sneak peek confirms at least Wonder Weapon for Black Ops 6, but there will undoubtedly be more.\n\n\nAs a longtime Black Ops fan, seeing Edward Richtofen through the lens of modern graphics is certainly a sight to behold. And having Nolan North voice him again makes it even more epic, bringing me back to the days when I first saw the character in Origins.\n\n\nWhile Richtofen looks to be the \"hero\" of the Liberty Falls cinematic, the Terminus Team, the playable crew of Black Ops 6, think otherwise. The Terminus trailer indicates that Edward will be the main target of the BO6 Zombies saga as a plot to seek revenge. He has done plenty of wrongdoings in previous entries, so now his past is finally catching up to him. \n\n\nThere's still a lot of mystery surrounding the Black Ops 6 Zombies story, but fortunately, the upcoming CoD Next event offers more insight into this. So, if you want some more Richtofen, tune into the event on Aug. 28 to get ready for BO6's Beta release.  \n\nThe post Richtofen and Wunderwaffe take the stage in CoD: Black Ops 6 Liberty Falls cinematic appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Trading Posts or Trade Outposts in No Man’s Sky are present on planets in all star systems with lifeforms. They serve a variety of purposes and are a good pitstop to buy and sell items using a Galactic Trade Terminal, like the one you find in Space Stations.\n\n\nHowever, trading posts are not useful if you need resources in bulk, as you won’t find as much quantity here as you would at a space station. However, rarer resources will be found at a Galatic Trade Terminal here, as compared to the ones on a Space Station, and for a lower price to boot.\n\n\nWith seven Landing Pads available, Trading Posts may serve as a decent spot to go starship-hunting and finally stumble upon an elusive S-class starship which you may have been tirelessly looking for in the game.\n\n\nImage via Hello Games\n\n\nYou may find Trading Posts by simply exploring a planet and discovering it from a distance, but that’s down to pure luck since planets in No Man’s Sky are massive. A much simpler and more effective way is to install an Economy Scanner in your starship, which lets you access the quick menu when in the starship to find a nearby trading post on the planet.\n\n\nThere are other ways to find a Trading Post, but the Economy Scanner is the only guaranteed way to locate them. If you cannot build an Economy Scanner, you can use a Planetary Chart (inhabited outpost) or a Signal Booster, but both will reveal information on any kind of structure, making them a trial-and-error method.\n\n\nOne more sneaky suggestion: Sometimes, you may find starships in a planet’s atmosphere that are not heading out towards space. If you follow these starships, they may also lead you to a trading post.\n\nThe post How to find Trading Post in No Man’s Sky appeared first on Destructoid.",

And also mobile via the Crunchyroll Game Vault if you’re into that sort of thing.\n\n\nVictory Heat Rally is a high-speed arcade racing game based on Sega’s quasi-3D super-scaler games like Power Drift. It’s also, last I checked, absolutely fantastic. I played the demo about a year ago. I came away several steps above impressed; somewhere in the realm of “enthusiastic.” It’s fast, colorful, and packed with personality.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been a long time coming. It had a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020, but development was a bit slow. It’s a small team, and the primary developer had a child, leading to them trying to adopt a healthier work/life balance. A release window was announced for Winter 2024, so it's going to be a bit early. But what can you do? Game development can be unpredictable.\n\n\nI’m happy to see its impending release. There is a complete dearth of arcade-style racing games these days. Some are arriving that cop a feel from Saturn and PS1 games. However, pre-3D racing games are among my favorite takes on the genre. I’ll be really jazzed if someone makes a new cross-country title like Rad Mobile.\n\n\nVictory Heat Rally releases on PC October 3, 2024.\n\nThe post Super Scaler inspired racing game Victory Heat Rally is out in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

In my save with the Houston Texans, both the Offensive and Defensive coordinators come with practically clean slates. Hence, they're the ones who will require more upgrades and Staff Points.\n\n\nDo note that even some of the relatively basic abilities can be very useful.

Many believed that the band itself was responsible, something we highlighted in our August 2009 article. Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
