Its wacky physics and endearing presentation stole the hearts of practically everyone who played it, and a re-release on Nintendo Switch back in 2017 reaffirmed its lofty status, but can its sequel reach similar, gooey heights?\nThe basic premise and structure of World of Goo 2 is essentially identical to that of the first: you have to get enough Goo Balls to the pipe to complete each level, and that largely means building a structure using said Goo Balls to shepherd as many Goo Balls as possible to the previously mentioned pipe. We’re going to be saying ‘Goo Balls’ a lot in this review, so buckle up.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The best of the best have Any% runs down to under four minutes these days, but there's still hope that it can be done faster. And so we reach the latest discovery, one that utilises a Wii U GamePad and a rubber band to shave three to four seconds off the current world record — if it's deemed legal (thanks, GamesRadar).\nFirst, some background. OOT speedrunners make use of a Stale Reference Manipulation (SRM) called Lightnode SRM to alter the game's code and memory through specific characters in the save game's filename. Such manipulation makes the end credits roll after the player completes a series of specific inputs in the opening Kokiri Forest section. It might not be the full-game experience, but hey, that's an Any % speedrun.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "This Mars has no bite.\nWhen Nintendo launched Metroid Dread in 2021, there was no doubt in our minds that it would inspire more fast-paced, gritty Metroidvanias later down the road. MARS 2120 is one such title; a sci-fi romp that attempts to capture the same magic that made Dread so special, but ultimately falls at almost every hurdle.\nIt starts off strong, taking place on the surface of Mars where you’re fleeing from an avalanche of rocks and rubble. It’s exciting stuff, but even during this introductory sequence, something about the controls just felt off. You’re blessed with a double-jump ability right from the start, but executing it never feels quite natural enough considering how often you’ll need to use it throughout the game. It’s not bad, as such, but it feels a bit too floaty for our liking.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.\nRead more",

Made with input from former CS pro and streamer Shroud, it looks a bit like a mix of CS and Valorant, but has a big gimmick that sets it apart from the two: you can swap between two bodies.

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.\nI cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.\nRead more",

Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ho, wayfarer! Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.\n Read more",

          "description": "I am burning the Bishop while he sleeps. I'd say it's nothing personal, but quite a lot in medieval management sim Norland is personal. He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide. \nRead more",

          "description": "Destiny 2 has a lot of different combat buffs you can get depending on your build. So many in fact that it can sometimes not display them all, seeing as there are only four buff slots on the left side of your screen. This is great since it means you're getting a ton of free bonuses, though what they do isn't always clear. Here's what Frost Armor is in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhat does Frost Armor do in Destiny 2?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nFrost Armor is a buff exclusively associated with the Stasis subclass and requires certain Aspects or Fragments to trigger. This is a stacking damage resistance buff, granting 4.5% damage resistance per stack going up to five stacks with 22.5% damage resistance. In PvP, this effect is dropped to 2% per stack for 10% maximum damage resistance. Each stack you get lasts 10 seconds, though additional stacks refresh the timer. With the Fragment Whisper of Rime, this can be increased to 10 stacks maximum for 45% damage resistance.\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, Woven Mail, which is acquired through various means in the Strand subclass, provides 45% damage resistance. This may sound woefully imbalanced, and to some extent it is, but it heavily depends on your subclass and build since both have other strengths.\n\n\nHow can you get Frost Armor?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nFrost Armor has a few ways of being acquired. Namely, the Whisper of Fractures Fragment provides you with a stack of Frost Armor when meleeing a Frozen target to shatter them. However, the more consistent sources of Frost Armor are the Glacial, Tectonic, and Grim Harvest Aspects, providing a stack of Frost Armor when picking up Stasis shards. These spawn frequently, so getting 5-10 stacks shouldn't be a problem on the right setup.\n\nThe post What is Frost Armor in Destiny 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Rinse and repeat.\n\n\nImage via Blizzard Entertainment.\n\n\nIf you do want to farm the lesser mobs that appeared in the zone once the event was over, those will be available in the other, \"inactive\" zones. \n\n\nFurthermore, rewards are being increased, and the weekly quests that rewarded 1,500 Residual Memories will now be daily across your account (to cut down on the urge to run the event across multiple alts). With bosses spawning so much more quickly and dropping the same loot, you should be getting a lot more event gear from drops alone, so those memories can be put to good use buying the event's mounts and pets. \n\n\nLeave it to Blizzard to outdate my blogpost in just 24 hours, but as Kaivax says, \"we hear you!\"\n\nThe post World of Warcraft’s Radiant Echoes event is getting a major overhaul appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, and Let Me Finish will likely leave us in stitches when they launch sometime in September. \n\n\n\n\nYes, you will be Fakin' It All Night Long!\n\n\nThe social deduction game Fakin' It returns in this All Night Long version as the faker tries to blend in as the participants tell the truth and perform a secret task. The idea is that you have to become the best liar in your group. This naughty version of the game will have new categories and an all-new remote play mode. \n\n\nDirty Drawful marks a return to the popular Jackbox game over the years but adds spicier prompts into the equation. Described as \"both terrible and titillating,\" to the point in which an undo button has been added to the game. If you haven't played Drawful before, it's like Pictionary, but everyone tries to fool other players into choosing their guess/answer. If another player chooses your option instead of the real answer, you'll get points.\n\n\nImage via Jackbox Games\n\n\nThe only new game added to the Jackbox Naughty Pack is Let Me Finish. It's a debate-style presentation game, in which you're answering odd questions, such as which \"meat\" most likely wants to be called daddy, for example. In the trailer, seven different meat sticks are shown and you have to choose which one is the daddiest. Another question asks, \"How does this avocado get aroused?\" I've got nothing, but surely know someone that'll bring the snark. \n\n\nThe Jackbox Naughty Pack is heading to consoles and PC sometime in September 2024 for $21.69. Ahhh, we see what you did there, Jackbox. \n\nThe post Jackbox Naughty Pack debuts Dirty Drawful and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

Available now on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this playable slice lets players experience the game’s first chapter and a big boss fight.</p>\n\n<p>The demo begins in the middle of Chapter 1 at Rime Falls and takes players through areas such as Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHIJtLufSsM\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years. Set in a vibrant, semi-open, fully 3D world, the adventure stars Val, who travels to the Mana Tree alongside his lifelong friend Hinna.

That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>\n\n<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate).

Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window.

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows<a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released\"> Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href=\"http://sobieska\">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.</p>\n\n<p>For more on Tekken 8, check out our <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/review/tekken-8/aggressively-absurd\">review</a>.</p>",
