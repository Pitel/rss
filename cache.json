This pair of spin-offs may not carry the main series' full moniker, but they are resolutely full-blooded Tomb Raider experiences that arrive on Nintendo's console in fine form, give or take a few performance issues and necessary excisions.\nBefore we dig into the issues, though, let's concentrate on what's great here, as there are plenty of positive things to say about both of these lovingly-crafted isometric adventures. Kicking off with 2010's Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, and we vividly remember being pretty blown away by what Crystal Dynamics served us up with this one on ye olde Xbox Arcade all those years ago. With its smaller scale, isometric viewpoint and cooperative gameplay, we were expecting a watered-down bit of tomb-raiding that focused more on fun with friends in a breezy arcade style. However, what we got was a game that could very easily be considered one of Lara's best adventures. (In fact, it's easily in this writer's top three.)\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, ok, not everyone is in the game, but Sakurai and co. did a pretty good job of bringing in familiar faces from all walks of gaming life. We've even got characters from other series in the genre like Street Fighter, Fatal Fury and Tekken. However, one name is notably missing from this lineup: Mortal Kombat.\nOf course, this makes a lot of sense. The blood and guts of NetherRealm Studios' take on the genre was never really going to gel with Nintendo's slightly less stabby brawl — and come on, nobody wants to see Kirby's insides — and, according to series co-creator Ed Boon, Nintendo has never asked for permission to move any of the characters over (thanks, Axios).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below. \nRead more",

Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.\nOh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.\nListen and subscribe via your podcast provider of choice!

This is extremely not what I expected next from the studio whose debut game made Adam backtrack to kill his own dog \"because the world is convincing and I didn't want to leave suffering animals lying around the place if I didn't have to.\" Come watch the trailer.\nRead more",

While Mimimi's previous games took place in mostly grounded historical settings, Shadow Gambit is about magical undead pirates hunting for mysterious booty and fighting a persecutive Inquisition. This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.\n\"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting,\" Abé tells me. \"That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic.\"\nRead more",

No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. \nHere’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.\nRead more",

It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.\nRead more",

From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn't have as good a ring to it (no one's going to be quoting \"it's in the entertainment,\" any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it's obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn't a video game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Shown off at this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, Sand Land is an upcoming RPG from the folks over at Ilca Inc, the developers of One Piece Odyssey, and the creator of Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama. It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.\nRead more",

It's around 85 to 90 percent of the performance at less than 70 percent of the cost - although you do give up better power efficiency and DLSS 3 on the newer model. \nWe've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE. \nRead more",

This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. \nThe specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required). \nRead more",

          "description": "There is an Xbox version, but it needs more time\nToday, Larian Studios announced that it's moving up the release date of Baldur's Gate 3 on PC and slightly delaying the PS5 version. Alongside those platforms, the studio says an Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 is still in the works. It's just a matter of getting it ready.\nIn a community update around the announcement, Larian said it's optimistic about Baldur's Gate 3 on the Xbox Series X. But in order to announce and release on Xbox, the studio will need to \"ensure the game is performing without compromise across the entire Xbox X|S ecosystem.\"\nEssentially? \"Like with the PS5 version, we'll release it when it's ready,\" Larian said. \"We'll update you as soon as we can.\"\nSplitting the screens\nLarian head Swen Vincke went into more detail about the status of the Xbox version in an interview with IGN. Vincke noted both the freedom of the game itself, and the split-screen co-op, as causes for its troubles. Vincke told IGN that Larian may have to make some \"compromises\" to get an Xbox version live, though he didn't specify what they were, and didn't want to confirm that would be the case for-sure.\nVincke also confirms that Larian is working with Microsoft's Xbox Advanced Technology Group (Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on the matter to IGN).\nAs the interview goes on, Vincke does say that the team's ambition is to release Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X|S this year, but it can't commit to that. Again, it's ready when it's ready.\n\"This one's not exclusive. You're going to be able to play it. It's just a matter of patience. This is really a question of time,\" Vincke said.\nAs for PC and PS5 players, the wait for Baldur's Gate 3 has shifted a bit with today's news. PC players will get the massive RPG on August 3, while PS5 players have to wait just a little bit longer for September 6.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 will release on Xbox ‘when it’s ready’, Larian says appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You can't go home (without a boss battle)\nAs part of the Annapurna Showcase 2023, the publisher has revealed that Thirsty Suitors will be arriving on November 2, 2023.\nInitially revealed back in 2021, Thirsty Suitors is a stylish mash-up of so many things. Coming to us from developer Outerloop Games, it takes skateboarding, combat, and cooking and drops them into a slice-of-life casserole. “Battle your exes, disappoint your parents, find yourself,” the trailer says. Yeah, I can totally relate to all of those things on a nauseatingly deep level. It’s all about going back home and seeing familiar faces again. That sounds like hell! Count me in!\nhttps://youtu.be/4LIj46_R62M\nThere’s a lot here, so it’s fortunate that Destructoid’s very own Eric “Peachfuzz” Van Allen went toe-to-toe with its demo last year. I’m still not entirely sure what to make of this whole thing, but Thirsty Suitors looks pretty awesome. It brings together relatable themes gussied up with some irresistible weirdness. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but I am entirely on board. There's currently a demo that you can check out if, like me, you are curious about what this game has to offer.\nThirst Suitors releases for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch platforms November 2, 2023.\nThe post Thirsty Suitors lusts of a November 2 release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "JACKPOT! JACKPOT! JACKPOT!\nLoot your change drawer, Zen Studios has confirmed that Pinball FX is going to drop on Switch next week. July 6, 2023, to be precise.\nTo be clear, this is the–I don’t know–reboot of Pinball FX. Because they got up to Pinball FX3 and then decided to start the sequence over. This is especially interesting because you can already get Pinball FX3 on Switch. Pinball FX is kind of built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4. I’m not sure why that’s necessary, but it means that your tables don’t carry over from the previous Pinball FX games. That kind of puts a damper on things.\nhttps://youtu.be/GSZYXzYaEaw\nBut, hey, it’s free to play. You get a one-day pass to try out everything. Afterward, you’re left with three tables you can play in unlimited fashion: West Rampage, Fish Tales, and Sorcerer's Lair. Tables after that are bought a la carte, or in small bundles. Other versions allow you to buy pinball coins or a pinball pass as another way of playing, but this won’t initially be part of the Switch version. The Switch is getting 21 tables that the platform hasn’t had before, so that’s something.\nI still feel scorned by the fact that Zen Studios got their hands on the Williams and Bally licenses, which were previously held by Farsight Studios for their game, Pinball Arcade. I loved Pinball Arcade because it felt like it was trying to be extremely faithful to the tables. It was kneecapped after losing those licenses and never recovered. However, Zen Studios seems to have gotten better about their authenticity, so maybe I’ll eventually finally migrate. It just still hurts, you know?\nPinball FX is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms. It releases on Switch July 6, 2023.\nThe post Pinball FX flips onto Nintendo Switch next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s more Resident Evil 4 flavor, with less fat!\nIf you’re unfamiliar with 2022’s Save Room, so am I. It’s an inventory management puzzle game based on the best part of 2005’s Resident Evil 4: the inventory. The goal was to arrange the various oddly-shaped objects into the limited space of the inventory case.\nSave Room: The Merchant shifts the concept closer to the Resident Evil 4 singularity. You’re made to think outside the case as you purchase items from the legally-distinct merchant character to prepare for the rigors of a level. You just need to make sure your adventurer has everything they need while trying to balance your pocketbook. There will be 40 bespoke levels that promise “relaxing music and sound effects.”\n[caption id=\"attachment_389499\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Fractal Projects[/caption]\nSave Room was something of an indie darling, so it’s great to see it continue on its legally-distinct way.

          "description": "\"Without hesitation\"\nThe current future of Super Smash Bros. is unclear. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate kind of did everything it needed to do, is fully exhaustive from a content perspective, and Nintendo confirmed that the final DLC roster additions are complete. Series head honcho Masahiro Sakurai is also taking a much-needed rest. But that doesn't prevent other folks from dreaming of what might have been, or what could be! That includes Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon.\nSpeaking to Axios, here's what Boon had to say when asked about his ideal Mortal Kombat roster addition for Smash:\n\"Scorpion. Not even a hesitation. I guess if they want two, it would be Scorpion and Sub-Zero.”\n\nBoon clarifies that they chose these two because they’re easy to see on the battlefield, and for the former, “it’s cool to see a spear pull somebody,” which current combatant Ridley would know a lot about.\nI mean, it's hard to really argue with him! They have more cartoony designs than a few other \"core\" Mortal Kombat fighters that would mesh with the Smash aesthetic, and they constantly top \"most recognizable characters\" polls for the series. Of course, the entire prospect of adding Mortal Kombat characters to Smash is absurd, but then again, there is a precedent (like Metal Gear Solid's Snake, or Bayonetta's Bayonetta)!\nThis isn't the first time someone has weighed in on dream Super Smash Bros. roster additions\nAs you may recall, Blizzard employees wanted Diablo to make an appearance in the Smash series years back, and multiple creatives have been slowly providing their \"dream picks\" either directly or indirectly with Nintendo.\nClearly, some of that hard work paid off, as Sora was introduced through a chance meeting with a Disney representative.\nThe post Ed Boon says if he could add a character to Super Smash Bros, it would be Scorpion appeared first on Destructoid.",

The current plan is to launch it into Early Access in 2024.\nAirborne Empire is the sequel to 2020’s Airborne Kingdom, a game that I can’t believe I haven’t played. It’s a game about building floating cities! However, it also ties in exploration, as a flying city is the ultimate mobile home. Airborne Empire will introduce pilots into the mix, making it so you’ll have to defend your city, as well as the cities on the surface. Airborne Kingdom was pretty well-received, so I’m interested to see how the sequel gets off the ground.\nhttps://youtu.be/l1ja7SaqFFM\nStray Fawn is the developer behind The Wandering Village, another unique take on the city builder genre. I had a chance to talk to co-founder Philomena Schwab about the whole genre, and it’s cool to see them get into the paradoxically named indie-publishing business. Getting noticed as a small or solo developer often seems like a communal effort, so I love watching them come together to form a supergroup. Airborne Empire will actually be Stray Fawn’s second publishing deal announced, after the upcoming Earth of Oryn.\nCurrently, Airborne Empire has only been announced for PC and Mac, and will be entering Early Access sometime in 2024.\nThe post Stray Fawn will be publishing Airborne Empire in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, the tables have turned, as a new fan-made mod for the classic game lets you play from the perspective of the rocket launcher-wielding beast.\nTitled \"Nemesis Scenario,\" curious fans may download this mod from ModDB (thanks DSO Gaming). You can also check the video below to see what it's like to fill the (heavy) boots of Nemesis and go stalking the streets of Raccoon City looking for members of S.T.A.R.S.\nhttps://youtu.be/Jov5_ziYcOM\nFlipping the script\nCreated by retro Resident Evil modder Komizo, \"Nemesis Scenario\" comes with two game modes. The first is the original, which lets you play Resident Evil 3 from the titular antagonist's point of view. The second is \"Arrange Mode,\" in which you hunt down S.T.A.R.S. and mercenaries, but without the story from the main game.\nThe video demonstrating the mod certainly takes away the tension typically found in Resident Evil 3. You''ll see Nemesis easily take out regular zombies, with cut scenes from the 1999 Resident Evil entry interspersed throughout. It kind of fits canonically, showing what Nemesis was possibly up to while Jill and Carlos frantically worked on puzzles.\nWhile both the original version and the remake of Resident Evil 4 left a big impact, many have not forgotten the classic entries in the series. Resident Evil 3 and its remake were not necessarily celebrated installments. But the 1999 release still counts itself among the first iconic Resident Evil games that established the franchise.\nSpeaking of remakes, Capcom recently asked which Resident Evil game fans wanted to see get remade next. Some fans may believe Resident Evil 5's turn is due, but Capcom has made no announcements at this time. For now, if you have the original Resident Evil 3 on PC, you can check out Komizo's Nemesis mod.\nThe post Original Resident Evil 3 can now be played from Nemesis’ POV appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Is it secure enough?\nLast night, I clicked on a link I saw floating around social media for something called The Password Game. It seemed a little neat; make a secure password against an ever-increasing set of rules. What I thought would be a momentary distraction ended up with me, and my Discord call, furiously searching Google and calculating math to try and outsmart an expanding, seemingly malicious ruleset. Our password, ultimately, failed.\nThe Password Game is a new overnight web game sensation from developer Neal Agarwal. They've made a number of fun, unique games with quirky problems to solve, like Absurd Trolley Problems. With The Password Game, it starts simple: make a password.\nOf course, good web games are never so simple. Gradually, Agarwal introduces rules. Rules that, as they describe it, \"ensure [they] will never see the pearly gates.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/nealagarwal/status/1673703594778927105\nRules, rules, rules\nI don't really want to spoil any of the big rule surprises for you, as that's a big part of the fun: discovering what The Password Game will throw at you. It was actually a joy to do this in a Discord call, and I highly, highly recommend doing the same if you can. Making The Password Game a social situation is great, not just because you can all collaborate, but you can share in the confusion. (My one hint? Maybe grab a Periodic Table of Elements.)\nEither way, go in sight unseen and just see how far you go. Maybe even share your first-time experiences here? I'm fascinated to see how far people get. Apparently, some folks are even beating it. I don't know if I can fully figure that out, but part of me—a deep-seated, unwell aspect of myself—does want to try. At the very least, I can end up with a very, very secure password.\nTry your hand at The Password Game here.\nThe post The Password Game is an unhinged uphill battle against rules appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No love for Nvidia, it seems\nIf you were hoping to get the most out of your Nvidia RTX 4000 graphics card when Starfield launches, you might be out of luck. It turns out developer Bethesda will optimize the anticipated sci-fi RPG for AMD's hardware instead.\nThis comes from a recent YouTube video from AMD itself, which says that the Starfield studio has partnered with the tech giant to make the game run better on systems that use its processors and graphics chips. This is great news for those of you who have a PC containing Team Red's products. Less so if you've been putting your stock into Nvidia's offerings.\nhttps://youtu.be/9ABnU6Zo0uA\nTodd Howard himself said that the team is excited to be partnering with AMD, getting the game to run as best as it can on that particular hardware. He adds that Starfield will use FSR 2.0 (AMD's upscaling technology that offers an alternative to Team Green's DLSS). Nvidia fans may feel they're being shafted a little on this front, especially for those who were hoping to get their money's worth from a 4000 series.\nHowever, for console users, this may be beneficial. The Xbox Series X/S runs on AMD technology, both in terms of CPU and GPU. Given that Starfield is an Xbox exclusive, many of you will likely choose this system for the game anyway. For PC users with an Nvidia card, obviously you'll still be able to run the game (depending on your spec). But it does sound like Bethesda has already sided with Lisa Su and her team.\nThat said, FSR 2.0 is more open-source than DLSS. This means you can still make use of the image processing algorithm even if you have an Nvidia graphics card.\nStarfield will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.\nThe post Starfield is being optimized for AMD hardware appeared first on Destructoid.",

The two of us, Zach Gage, and Greg Wohlwend just couldn’t resist the opportunity of revisiting the game that catapulted our careers — and having an opportunity to approach the game anew without the catch of the clones, and with 10 years of development experience.

          "description": "Johnny Silverhand gives his hot take\nThere isn't long to wait now until Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC releases. Following on from the main story, the new content will be a moodier dive into the underbelly of Night City's already seedy vibes. That's according to Keanu Reeves, anyway.\nIn a recent video posted to the official Cyberpunk 2077 YouTube channel, the actor, who reprises his role as Johnny Silverhand for the upcoming expansion, has been shooting the breeze about the DLC. When asked how he would describe Phantom Liberty, Reeves said that Dogtown, where the new story takes place, goes down to a \"darker place\" when compared to the vanilla game.\nhttps://youtu.be/LXXqI6eYD6w\nPerhaps channeling his inner Johnny, Reeves asserts (after politely asking if he could swear during the interview) that \"s**t's gone down\" in this new location. He adds that, in spite of the even more dystopian atmosphere that's incoming, he hopes it'll be a fun experience for people to play as well.\nThe Matrix star also talks a little bit about Solomon Reed, a new character in Phantom Liberty played by Idris Elba. His presence represents that extra bit of Hollywood stardom that CDPR wants for the expansion. Reeves says that Johnny has some things in common with Solomon, such as the \"sense of being used\" and the idea of trying to reclaim one's own life.\nhttps://youtu.be/yifBJOwKFw0\nCyberpunk 2077 may have been one of the most controversial launches in game history, but the studio eventually turned things around with patches a-plenty. The upcoming DLC, which drops September 26, will give more than a few fans another reason to dive into this world. It sounds like it's going to be an interesting, if gritty, experience. Keanu Reeves summarizes Phantom Liberty by saying that it's a mixture of mystery, truth, a scavenger hunt for information, and whether or not you can count on anything.\nThe post Keanu Reeves discusses Cyberpunk 2077’s DLC: ‘s**t’s going down’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Time really has lost all meaning.\nIn any case, even though Power Drill Massacre was unfinished at the time, it was a pretty good first impression. Originally released in 2015, it helped establish the lo-fi horror genre among the indie market. Maybe. I mean, it probably helped, but I think it was something that gradually emerged through the work of Puppet Combo and others.\nWhat was I getting at? Oh, right, Power Drill Massacre has been unfinished for all these years. Soon, we’ll finally get to really bore into the delicious meats of the full version.

          "description": "A lot of people will be Street Fighting\nThe latest Street Fighter has been out for just shy of a month now, and it sure seems like it's caught on. The current number of Evo registrants seems to back up this popularity too, as the tournament organizer confirms Street Fighter 6 is breaking both franchise and all-time Evo player count records.\nShared on social media, the Evolution Championship Series says Street Fighter 6 has officially broken both a franchise and all-time Evo record for competitors.\nhttps://twitter.com/EVO/status/1673466628636561408\nEvo doesn't share how many players that is. But if we're judging by the previous record count of Street Fighter V at Evo 2016, that's over 5,000 registrants.\nSign-ups for Evo 2023 are still live for a little less than two weeks. Evo 2023 is set to run August 4 through 6 in Las Vegas, NV.\nBack in the saddle again\nI have to admit, it's nice to see Street Fighter thriving like this. Sure, Street Fighter V delivered some pretty great sets over the years. But it always felt like SFV couldn't get out from under its launch state.\nMeanwhile, Street Fighter 6 has been an absolute grand slam. As Moyse put it so well, Street Fighter 6 is \"a title that radiates excellence.\" And the players have been showing up, too. Alongside the big Evo numbers, this last week's CEO—where MenaRD took the top spot with both Luke and Blanka—also tallied up a ton of entrants.\nSafe to say that Street Fighter 6 has made its impact on the scene. I'm curious to see what these numbers look like moving forward, after the launch year luster wars off. But this year's Evo debut for SF6 promises to be a big one.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 breaks franchise and all-time Evo records for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon. \nAre you excited about this reveal? Let us know in the comments below!",

It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: \n\n\nAs you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. \nThirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2. \nAre you going to check out Thirsty Suitors this November?

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.\nDuring any cutscene in FFXVI, you can hold the tou…",

We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. \nWhat’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added. \n\n\nHere’s a look at the top 10 best …",

The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. \nFort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. \nFor more, check out the Fort Solis reveal trailer from last year.\nAre you playing Fort Solis this August?

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

          "description": "Sonic Superstars received prime placement in both the Summer Game Fest 2023 stream and this week's Nintendo Direct. As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.\nPlayers will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.\n\n\nWhile Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.\nSonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year. For more, check out our hands-on preview right here.",

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. \nLocalization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region.

Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. \nHowever, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.\n\n\nToday's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\" \n\"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you,\" Hines said, according to IGN.\nBethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today. \n[Source: IGN]\nEditor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.",

The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. \n\n\nThis enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks.

But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.\nWhile the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises \"valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider.\" \nThe Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.\n\n\nThe 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous. \nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a trip, and it launches on October 20.",

From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.\n\n\nThe main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.\nYou'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.\nFinally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.\nIf you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.",

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
