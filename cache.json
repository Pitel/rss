Although one is undoubtedly flourishing more than the other right now (if you don't know which one, then we can't help you), both have had a major impact on the horror genre and gaming as a whole.\nIn a rather lovely surprise, Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama have got together to reminisce about the \"good ol' days\" when 3D gaming was just just starting to take off and the survival horror genre was born. Both seem quite open about their respective experiences within the gaming industry and it's clear that Mikami's involvement with the Resident Evil franchise inspired Toyama with his work on Silent Hill.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The company was founded 1889 to create playing cards, and over the course of the next few decades would try its hand at several other markets – including toys, 'love hotels' and even instant rice.\nThese projects were the brainchild of Hiroshi Yamauchi, the man who would eventually steer the company towards interactive entertainment. A wily negotiator and visionary businessman, Yamauchi's instinct would prove instrumental in the '70s, '80s and '90s, but in his younger years, he was clearly keen to try as many ideas as possible to see which one would stick.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There’s something to be said for the scrappy B-tier games that, let’s face it, make up the majority of most systems’ libraries. A lot of them simply don't get a second look because they appear, you know, a bit cheap. And, when we first booted up Imp Of The Sun, we had the same sort of feeling. The game doesn't look particularly polished. You go into a dismissive sort of state; after all, there are a lot of games out there, aren't there? Who has time for the 6 and 7-out-of-10s of the world?\nHere's an interesting thing, though; seven is actually a pretty high number, when you've only got ten to play with. Imp Of The Sun is the archetypal seven — it looks fine. It feels fine. It's been compared to the Ori games, but we found it more reminiscent of Drinkbox's tremendous Guacamelee! series in the way that it likes to lock you in combat arenas and not let you leave until every last enemy has been juggled into submission.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This decision was understandably met with frustration from fans, however game director Michael Steranka has now provided some context to the changes in an interview with Kotaku.\nCrucially, Niantic doesn't want Pokémon Go to be a game that can be played to its fullest extent in the comfort of your own home. Naturally, changes were required to account for the restrictions surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but Niantic is now taking a stance of trusting players to make sensible decisions on how they navigate local rules and restrictions. Steranka states that Niantic \"encourages players to follow local guidelines and regulations,” but \"that’s not something we are trying to police on our side\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It's a strange thing, returning to the world of Death Stranding after more than a year away. Having done that classic thing of rinsing almost every last delivery out of it before finally strapping myself in for its rollercoaster ending back in 2020, there hasn't been much reason to return to my precious, daft BB Boys in the intervening months - not even its Cyberpunk 2077 crossover was enough to tempt me back. At long last, though, I have cause to load up the BB train again. Death Stranding Director's Cut arrives on Steam and the Epic Games Store today, bringing with it new story missions, new delivery buddies, new weapons and... a Mario Kart-style race track? Yep, that sounds like a classic Kojima upgrade pack, if you ask me. Not quite as revolutionary as Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, mind, but it's roughly in the same kind of ballpark. \nIt's been great fun revisiting the lush mountains of Death Stranding's definitely not Icelandic version of post-apocalyptic America. If anything, the weirdest thing is seeing that same world I know and love on a fresh server, bereft of all the distracting neon signs, yelps of \"Keep on keeping on!\" and one-upmanship bridge-building that made up the bulk of the original's asymmetric online multiplayer component. It's actually quite refreshing to see these virgin, unspoiled landscapes again, although I imagine this won't last long once returning players flock back to their well-worn delivery routes. As for the new new stuff, is it worth making a return trip? As with all expando games, the answer will very much depend on if and how much you played the first one. \nRead more",

          "description": "After months of rumours, Sony have finally unveiled their answer to Xbox Game Pass today. Starting this June, their new subscription service will unite PlayStation Plus and their cloud streaming platform PlayStation Now under one roof, offering three different tiers of membership. Most of it isn't that relevant to us on PC, but the final, most expensive tier, PlayStation Plus Premium, will include that aforementioned cloud streaming to PC, letting us play hundreds of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PSP games without having to own an actual PlayStation.\nIt's not yet clear how that library of games will differ from the current PlayStation Now library, but one thing is certain: this is a move that definitely benefits people with a PlayStation and a PC more than it does standalone PC peeps. And yet, even as someone who falls into the former camp of PlayStation and PC owners, I'm still not sure this new PS+ is something I actually want. Sure, there's that massive retro collection on offer, but no Day One games I can either play on my console or stream to PC? On your bike, Sony. Personally, I see this as more of a dip-in and dip-out kinda deal to indulge my occasional retro cravings, but I'm keen to know what you, RPS readers, think of this new PS Plus offering as well. Does it appeal in any shape or form? And how does it compare to Game Pass for you? Let's chat about it below. \nRead more",

The catch is other players and inconvenient helicopter schedules. Other Prospectors will murder you for your precious rocks and weeds, so your aim is to get a helicopter out of Fortuna before this happens.

Every day you wake up, leave your apartment and hit the streets, chatting to the locals, picking up a bit of info, even gambling a bit. The folks you meet are from the shadier side of society and they'll hire you for jobs. Sometimes it’s simple burglary, sometimes it's breaking a vase, or snatching a specific bit of loot. There’s even a guy who keeps trying to offer me wet work! It all boils down to the same thing though: sneaking around some rich guy’s place, disabling the security, avoiding or taking down the occupants, and getting out without being caught. Afterwards, I fence the loot and head to bed.\nIt's all building up to Abermore's central heist: The Feast of the Lucky Few. It's also my only chance to rescue the famous Hanged Man, a dame I met on the boat over here. They're the thief of thieves! A living legend! But the tyrant king grabbed her before we got ashore and she’ll be executed in eighteen days if I don’t break her out. That’s eighteen nights to prepare, eighteen jobs to build the resources, the connections I need for the heist of a life time. A terrible shame, then, that alarm bells started ringing almost as soon as I started playing.\nRead more",

You see, in Patrick's line of work, his cubes contain multitudes, to misquote that famous Walt Whitman line. As long as they're resting against a hard surface, cubes can be packed into other cubes in Patrick's Parabox like a stack of matryoshka dolls. They can also be unpacked in the same way, allowing him to navigate the tight constraints of his respective puzzle arenas with surprising dexterity. It's like he's discovered the TARDIS of sokoban-style cube-pushing, if you will, and cor, just imagine what Wilmot could do with such technology. That warehouse would be immaculate. \nRead more",

They are, after all, the reason its ludicrous scale is workable at all beyond the opening hours, and a major reason its predecessor was so interesting and forward-thinking to begin with. But they are also a source of great friction and confusion, especially if you don't take the time to learn how they actually work.\nDistant Worlds 2 is, ultimately, a game that you need to meet in the middle.

I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. \nYou can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can be devastatingly powerful. \nRead more",

As long as there is food, more buggos will come, and as long as there are buggos, they will loosely move in the direction you command, dying in droves but succeeding in aggregate.

It's the first time a game has ever won both awards in the same year, which is a stonking achievement. Clearly, our Advent Calendar made some pretty big waves this year.

          "description": "As several members of the RPS Treehouse can attest, I have not been able to stop playing Tunic this week. I was a little cautious going in, having not particularly gelled with the E3 demo from last year, but in hindsight, that early glimpse was nothing but the tip of a tiny fox nose peeking out of its burrow. In its full, regal splendour, Tunic has become an early game of the contender for me, and a large part of that is down to its wonderfully clever in-game instruction manual.\nWhen Imogen (RPS in peace) interviewed Tunic dev Andrew Shouldice last September, they talked about how instruction manuals were a fundamental part of a game's design back in the days of the NES, and at one point he even pulled out his old instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link to demonstrate some of the \"tantalising hints\" they'd offer to curious players. As Brendan (also RPS in peace) noted in our Tunic review, the in-game manual is indeed a critical part of what makes Tunic special, and the act of piecing it together page by page really does capture that feeling of discovering some great secret that only you and the dev team know about. But here's a secret between you and me: it's not by chance Shouldice pulled out that old Zelda II manual during our interview last year. His fox hero may be cut from the same cloth as Nintendo's green sword-swinger, but the art inside Tunic's instruction manual also pays a wonderful tribute to those Zelda booklets of yore, too. \nRead more",

At this stage I’m less of a worthy Tarnished warrior on their way to be crowned the Elden Lord and instead more of a Mr. Bean type, accidentally succeeding through sheer incompetence alone. I can’t explain it, but my method of defeating Godrick had the same energy as Bean making a sandwich, in that I think the game eventually just took pity on me and let me win the fight to save me any further embarrasment.\r\n\n\r\nI’m coming to terms with the fact I may never finish Elden Ring. I'm only in the second proper area, but I'm finding encounters to require a level of patience I simply don't possess. Its boss fights are simply too hard. But if I’m struggling this much at such an early stage, what else could Elden Ring possibly have to offer? What types of monstrosities lurk in the farthest reaches of the Lands Between, and how difficult are they to defeat? Spoilers, naturally, below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As for 3D platformers, Super Mario 64 remains a glowing example of how movement makes exploration joyful. String together rolls and jumps and you're not just navigating a world, but bounding through it like a gymnast (who's also a part time plumber to help pay the costs of serious competition).\nElden Ring is a terrible platformer. It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast. But this is what makes its platforming sections good. They force you to embrace your limited toolset and channel your amateur longjumping, golfing, and climbing skills you definitely don't have.\nRead more",

Turned traitors in the war between demigods and giants, their reward for loyalty to the Golden Lineage was an eternity in shackles, used as frontline fodder in bloody conflicts or beasts of burden hauling funereal carriages around the Lands Between. Since learning their history, I often muse sadly upon it, as I weave between their horribly gnarled legs in my freshly tarnished underwear and hoover up the shiny objects scattered underneath their feet. \r\n\n\r\nI’m on my second run of Elden Ring now, progressing slowly and methodically, examining every statue and reading every spell description. But the first time through, the need to cram the whole content buffet in my face at once got the better of me. Underleveled and underprepared for most areas, I developed the winning strategy of stripping down to my burial rags for a speed boost and streaking through the wilds, shoving everything valuable down my pants. \r\n\n \nRead more",

One thing I failed to mention, though, was Roach, Geralt's horse.\nI'm sure Roach has a great personality, I'm sure he's very kind. But from a purely professional standpoint, I can't stand him. He's hardly smooth in the stirrups, nor can he really climb anything substantial. That's why I'd like Roach swapped out for Elden Ring's Torrent, a horse-goat that corners like Colin McCrae and double jumps like Super Mario.

The whole conversation I had with these two dudes was over 40 minutes long. So much of interviews gets discarded (like tears in rain etc) and the process of distilling it all down to a few quotes can be, to put it succinctly, a pain in the hole.

          "description": "The freakishly anthropomorphised four-fingered glove is back, and it's not even Halloween! You'll be able to play as Glover in a brand new PC port coming to both Steam and GOG, and rather than restoring the old PC port that already exists, it's been \"completely redone\" using the original source code from the N64 version of the game.\r\n\nPiko Interactive are the developers behind this release. Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is. Piko's previous releases typically also include the original file for the game, so hopefully Glover purists will also be satisfied by this version. And game preservation is always a good thing.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Microsoft recently announced that they’d cracked how to get Game Pass games running on the handheld Steam Deck. Great! It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.\r\n\n\r\nAfter having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all. Still, a beta is a beta, and there are very much some kinks to work out.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The update's split into two halves, with one focused on providing new content, and the other full of changes to try to improve the game based on player feedback.

For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. \nIt's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting? I feel a great disturbance in the Force.  \nRead more",

One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. \nWhile I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.\nRead more",

With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. \nIf you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay?

It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.\nRead more",

Let's embrace Chaos.\nStranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards. You'll finish the game and part as strangers still, probably.\nRead more",

          "description": "From the small slice I've played of samurai slasher Trek To Yomi, I'm convinced it's going to be the most Instagrammable game out there. Every frame looks gorgeous, capturing feudal Japan through a grainy black and white lens that evokes classic samurai flicks. Thankfully, there's some substance to match this style too. Combat is elegant and the story seems refined, not bloated, which makes this a ronin romp worth watching out for.\nRead more",

However, House of the Dragon centers on the inner turmoil that led to their downfall, particularly a civil war known as the Dance of Dragons. The show draws partial inspiration from author George R.R. Martin’s 2018 book Fire & Blood.  \nThe cast includes Matt Smith (Prince Daemon Targaryen), Olivia Cooke (Lady Alicent Hightower), Paddy Considine (King Viserys I Targaryen), and Emma D’Arcy (Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen). Writer and producer Ryan J. Condal (Rampage, Colony) and George R.R.

In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.\nWarning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, some aspects of the narrative and characters are mentioned thr…",

Sony has announced that the online servers for the 2017 title are shutting down later this year.\nThe shutdown occurs on September 30, as per a message that appears when you visit the game’s PlayStation Store page. It also states that “all online features (including online multiplayer modes) will cease on that date. You will still be able to play and enjoy the game in single-player offline modes.” \nThat means Everybody Golf will lose its online open-course exploration, where players could freely roam courses and communicate with other players. It also lets players indulge in non-golfing activities such as fishing and swimming. Competitive options such as the game’s Turf Mode and international tournaments will also fall to the wayside. \nFurthermore, this also means that the following online-dependent trophies will no longer be attainable:\nPlatinum Trophy – “Push it to the Limit!”\nGold Trophy – “Walking Encyclopaedia”\nBronze Trophy – “Online Debut”\nEverybody Golf launched in August 2017 and was the first entry to drop the North American Hot Shots Golf branding (it was always Everybody’s Golf in Japan). Though it wasn’t exactly a hole-in-one in terms of features or depth out of the box, it’s always sad to see another online mode fall to server cuts. There’s no official explanation for the shutdown, but maintaining servers costs money. One must assume the online community isn’t active enough to justify keeping the lights on at this point. \nTo learn more about Everybody’s Golf, check out our review.",

But we're not going quietly into that good night. We have one last 4K episode of New Gameplay Today with developer Luminous Productions' exciting followup to Final Fantasy XV, including even more exclusive looks at the game. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nJoin Alex Stadnik as he assembles the dream team to go into the nitty-gritty of Forspoken with industry powerhouses Kim Wallace and Jill Grodt. The three of them kick things off with a look at an area of the game that has been ravaged by The Break, a storm that's causing inhabitants of Athia to mutate into fantastical and disturbing creatures. Just like our previous coverage, protagonist Frey Holland's powers are on full display, showing off her vast array of spells she can wield and all the gorgeous particle effects to compliment them. We also jump into our hands-off thoughts on the game's traversal and discuss why we hope it will be one of the highlights of our experience. \nFinally, we wrap up this fun 10-minute look at the game with our closing thoughts on Square Enix's next action RPG, and what we're thinking of our time seeing the game ahead of its October 11 release date for PlayStation 5 and PC.\nWe know you're sad our coverage of Forspoken is wrapping up shortly, but fear not. We still have one more written piece coming to the website. If that's just not enough, you can enjoy plenty of Forspoken content, including our written and video looks at the numerous spells in the game, our preview impressions on an episode of The Game Informer Show, and so much more.

What this means is that if you don’t own Fast & Furious Crossroads come April 29, you won’t be able to buy it digitally at any point after that. However, because it was released physically, you could always track down a hard copy of the game. \nBandai Namco says that “if you bought the game digitally, it will remain in your library and can be redownloaded in the future.” DLC for it will be delisted on April 29 as well, so if you’re interested in owning that, you’ll need to purchase it soon. The DLC is completely digital so don’t rely on physical copies of Fast & Furious Crossroads to add it to your library, because that won’t be possible. Despite all of this, its online functionality will remain active. \nFor more about Fast & Furious Crossroads, watch its zany reveal at The Game Awards 2019, which saw stars Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto) and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty Ortiz) take to the stage to talk about the game.

I bet you never expected a former president to make an appearance in the game. That’s right, Bill Clinton is a prop in the background of one of Guilty Gear Strive’s various arenas. Sure he’s not a playable fighter, but he is a gracious spectator.\nGamespot provided the details of why his inclusion is so cheeky and ironic. Clinton condemned a 1999 ad for the game: “kill your friends, guilt free.” Guilty Gear wasn’t the only title mentioned. Still, in a video I’ll link here, Clinton does state that the violence apparent in the slogan mentioned above is “the most unbelievable [example]” of all the games he criticized. While this speech has seemingly been lost to time, Guilty Gear fans have taken pride in their favorite fighter’s beratement. Now, Clinton is the latest addition to the game all these years later. Things always come full circle, don’t they?\nI booted up figure mode in Strive and I am happy to say we have come full circle. pic.twitter.com/hn0v3RFEu8\nMarch 28, 2022\nThe picture of Clinton (seen above) is pretty blurry, but that’s undoubtedly him. The update dropped yesterday with the White House Reborn map that features the 42nd president of the United States, the addition of fan-favorite fighter Testament, and the Digital Figure mode which was used to discover the Clinton photo in the first place. Guilty Gear Strive’s second season is off to a hilariously good start.  \n[Source: Gamespot]",

          "description": "Dedicated tabletop gaming tables have been gaining steam for some time now, offering custom solutions for players who want a more nuanced solution for where to play out RPG or board game nights. Game Theory Tables is one of the recognized players in the category, thanks largely to the success of its customizable Origins table. Today, the team is launching a new crowdfunding drive for that table and a recently announced new coffee table format of a similar design, alongside a substantial discount on their standard pricing.\nThe original Origins table was most notable for its customizability, including a choice of wood color, playmats, cupholders, and optional accessories like USB chargers and dice-rolling towers. But its chief success lies in its recessed design, which offered a 4-inch recessed play area, which a dining top could cover, keeping in-process games in stasis while the family enjoys dinner, and allowing the game to pick back up when the group is ready to get back to the action.\nThe new coffee table variation of the Origins table seems to recognize that many players have switched to a more relaxed approach to game night get-togethers. The idea seems to be that the crowd is gathered in easy chairs and couches, leaning in to take a turn when the time is right, but you still want a suitable play space.\nAlongside the new coffee table twist, Game Theory is also updating the original Origins table for its latest run in 2022.\nThe two options are headed into a new crowdfunding drive, with a planned slate of 650 units of each table available for purchase, and with pricing marked to 30 percent below Game Theory’s standard website pricing. If you’ve been waiting and considering springing for a new play surface to enjoy with your gaming group, the Kickstarter goes live today.",

While exploring the ominously named “Murder Castle,” things quickly take a turn for the worse as the crew is stalked by a dangerous figure. \nThe Devil In Me ostensibly launches this year given the yearly release cadence of previous Dark Pictures games but Supermassive has not confirmed a release window.  It will serve as the finale of the first season of the Anthology. It was assumed that the final four entries in the planned eight-game series would make up Season 2; however, Supermassive recently trademarked the titles of five more games, bringing the total number to 10. \nSupermassive has a busy 2022 ahead because it also has the summer camp slasher horror game The Quarry hitting this June.

What’s odd is that 2K, the publisher behind BioShock Infinite, hasn’t really publicly acknowledged these updates. On top of that, there’s no confirmed reasoning behind them either as BioShock Infinite remains the same game it was before the updates started happening. \nAccording to TheGamer, it received seven updates in 2021 and now, in March alone, it’s had 13. Players have begun speculating about what these updates mean, and why they’re happening, and some have arrived at a possible remaster of BioShock Infinite, or a new-gen update (which could theoretically affect the PC version). Others think that perhaps 2K is working on some back-end stuff to make BioShock Infinite a Steam Deck-ready game. \nHowever, what seems most likely is some behind-the-scenes work on 2K launch integration, as pointed out by LitheBeep on Reddit. Zorklis on Reddit, in response, said one of the updates features “2K Launcher Development Branch” in it, seemingly confirming that the updates have to do with this launcher and not anything more exciting like a remaster or new-gen update. Perhaps 2K will end the speculation by letting everyone know what’s going on with BioShock Infinite. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s BioShock Infinite review and then listen to Game Informer’s Video Gameography crew dive deep into the history of BioShock.

The team needs more time to bring its vision to life, and it’s taking an additional five months to do just that. \nHey Everyone,\npic.twitter.com/R9xRCUbtIt\nMarch 25, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, Endnight Games included a quick snippet of video showcasing some things in Sons Of The Forest, including what appears to be a dazed NPC, the protagonist eating a raw fish, a log shelter being built, a target being unfolded, and more. \nThe last we saws of Sons Of The Forest was in a December trailer that showcased how terrifyingly brutal the survival game is, with some sequences appearing to be straight-up horror. Sons Of The Forest builds upon The Forest’s survival mechanics, which included collecting materials to craft shelters and build hunting tools, finding and foraging food to keep you alive, and more. Endnight Games’ latest looks like a treat for fans of the genre. We’ll all find out this October. \nFor more, watch this release date trailer for Sons Of The Forest and then read about 30 gross things you can do in The Forest. Find out why it’s one of our most anticipated horror games this year after that. \nAre you excited about Sons Of The Forest? Let us know in the comments below!",

After saying farewell to co-host Ben Reeves in the last episode, we welcome GI Associate Editor John Carson to the podcast as the new co-host alongside the ever-present Marcus Stewart. Along with a series of guests, season 5 of Video Gameography will be an exploration and examination of 2K's Bioshock franchise.\nSo, we cordially ask, would you kindly follow us into the depths of the sea? We're headed to the city of Rapture, made by and for movers and shakers, unbound by the expectations and judgments of the surface world.\nDeveloped by Irrational Games (AKA 2K Boston) and released in 2007, Bioshock reimagined and redefined what a modern shooter could be. In this episode, we explore the origins of the series stemming from the commercial failures of the well-loved PC franchise System Shock and the turbulent development cycle in which Bioshock triumphantly succeeded in spite of. We discuss director Ken Levine's inspirations of Rapture and its inhabitants like the industrial mastermind Andrew Ryan, the Big Daddies, Little Sisters, and much more.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc (@LeBlancWes) as we unpack the history and narrative of the first Bioshock! \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

That means even fans who played previous Lego Star Wars titles won't be getting the same games they finished years ago. Although the development wasn't without significant bumps in the road, we look forward to seeing how it all comes together when Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga launches on April 5.\nFor more on the game, you can read TT Games explain how The Skywalker Saga feels like one cohesive galaxy and how it will receive post-launch DLC based on The Mandalorian.",
