Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights. \r\n\n \nRead more",

And thus, a new Snyderverse is born. Not that they showed us said game, mind, or really told us anything about it. It will be set after both Rebel Moon films, though, so you better get watching if you want to know what the hell is going on.

We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup. \nRead more",

Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).\nThe rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.\nRead more",

Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. \nIt's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.\nRead more",

This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.\nRead more",

This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.\nDespite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.\nRead more",

This is probably because Firewatch isn't a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.\nI think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.\nDon't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.\n Read more",

          "description": "Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. \r\n\n\r\n“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.\r\n\n\r\nThe update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.\r\n \nRead more",

The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) \"lore\", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.\nIt's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?\nRead more",

A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.\r\n\nNow it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations.

          "description": "ONCE AGAIN, SPOILERS. PLEASE DO NOT READ BECAUSE THERE ARE SPOILERS PRESENT. SPOILERS. HEY LOOK SPOILERS.\nI'm playing Edders Sheeran in Baldur's Gate 3, a bard with a Dark Urge to lash out and murder largely anything and everything. He doesn't know what causes it, and he doesn't know when the urge might strike. For a first playthrough, it's been a learning experience. Namely, I have learned that friends aren't safe, lest I puncture their guts with my bare fists in the middle of the night.\nI thought the urge would only bring downsides (what you'd normally get as a murderer), but I've also learned that it actually has benefits? You get capes in exchange for pulping people! I love capes! Here's to more of them.\nRead more",

Genius-level journostrategist that I am, I managed to book a week away walking in Scotland during Gamescom before landing the gig, and I can't rebook without incurring the everlasting hatred of Caledonian Sleeper. I do have a few under-embargo stories and a review going live next week, but beyond that I'll be up a mountain somewhere until 29th August. Apologies - if you're up that neck of the woods and we happen to sight each other on opposing hillsides, I'll try to bellow something about Starfield.\r\n\n\r\nBefore I go, though, I wanted to check in about this whole \"news\" concept that's doing the rounds. The past two weeks have essentially been an exercise in tentatively pressing buttons and apologising to Katharine when half the website backend catches fire. I've tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday's musings about pacifism - but I've mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.\n  \nRead more",

We've already had one that makes Baldur's Gate 3 a single character RPG, which I am hoping somebody at the RPS Treehouse will do a diary feature about, plus a Painterly Scenery filter created by 1wk, which makes the game look like it's daubed on canvas.

It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I'm not gonna lie. I've had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I'd arrived fresh and green, I don't think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is. \nRead more",

          "description": "The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.\nIt seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets. \nRead more",

The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.\r\n\n\r\nOpus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018's Rocket Of Whispers and 2021's Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. \"They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,\" is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Being a reviewer during Big Game Season often feels like being chased through a massive, winding building in a serial killer movie (or possibly Until Dawn). You gallop shrieking and blundering round a corner and are confronted by a series of ominous doors with labels such as \"Baldur's Gate 3\". You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you're commissioned to do a, haha, \"retrospective\" 10 years later.\nThis summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked \"Zelda\" and \"Final Fantasy 16\", then spent a frantic moment trying to force the \"Baldur's Gate 3\" door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I'm mixing my scenarios - it's the end of the day and I'm tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened. By far the grimmest and grandest of these is, of course, Diablo 4.\nRead more",

This follows equally knotty breakdowns of its zoning tools, which allow you to mix architectural styles, and its road traffic system, which will hopefully dispense with some of the pathfinding issues from the original Cities: Skylines. In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. \nStill. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.\nRead more",

          "description": "I have, for the past several weeks, been playing Baldur's Gate 3, the RPG equivalent of paying for ex-special forces lads to kidnap you at an unappointed day when you're walking your labradoodle, and put you through a rigorous (pretend) interrogation schedule. Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it's over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.\nHammerwatch 2 is out today, and it's kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It's like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as \"adorable\", and it makes everything seem like it's a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don't want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn't quite right and there's some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.\nRead more",

RIGHT, ONTO SPOILER TERRITORY.\nI met this really nice bard in Baldur's Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.\nAnyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. \"Of course, we'd love to have you,\" I replied. What could possibly go wrong?\nRead more",

Little Jinmu does a lot of running to the right, a lot of slashing, and probably very little parrying and punching once you figure out the power attack.\r\n\n\r\nThere is, bluntly, not a lot to it, especially while its online mode is still listed as \"coming soon\".

It's a chunky enough tome made up of 100 of the puzzles that form Murdle's daily little treat, split into sections of escalating difficulty. And, against my expectations, and despite basically being a vehicle for logic grid puzzles, Murdle has an actual plot. Which is more than many video games manage.\nRead more",

You'd think, then, that a game about a nomadic Iron Age people larking about in a horrible swamp would be made for me, but unfortunately, Gord is somehow both a game where you can feed a child to a forest-dwelling horror, and a game that's kind of dull.\nIt's the only memorable thing that happened, and I did it to save time. The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous. I might rationalise the choice as the lesser evil, one life sacrificed to spare the lives of several, but the reality is that sending all those dudes back and forth across the map just sounded like too much hassle.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've been itching to play The Lords Of The Fallen since I discovered that it's a closet Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver homage (see my bio), with a sorcerous lantern that lets you switch between the living and unliving worlds of Axiom and Umbral. Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you'll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.\nYou're also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you'll have to restart from one of the game's Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I'm hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game's many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.\nRead more",

I mean sure, every big brand has to have a Musou eventually. And you can see the RPG throughline that connects Persona with the Etrian Odyssey-style Persona Q. But a fighting game set in the Persona universe? A collection of rhythm games based on Persona soundtracks? The crazy part is, no matter what direction Persona spinoffs take, they always seem to land strong and find fans.

Sure, the first games featured students summoning demons like they’re Pokémon. But your social links, life sim elements, and more – that all started with Persona 3. I know many who still consider it a series high, but honestly, Persona 3 has always been a bit hard to come back to. On PS2, the game is missing essential quality of life, such as being able to even control your own party members. And while the PSP version fixes some of this, it comes with the caveat of feeling very much like a condensed PSP game.\nAs someone who has tried and failed to get deep into Persona 3 myself, I’ve been deeply curious abo…",

          "description": "During Gamescom Opening Night Live we got to see the first official gameplay trailer for Crimson Desert. It's no surprise, but the gameplay looks like a revamped and enhanced version of the combat from Black Desert Online.\nThe war-torn and medieval fantasy world of Pywel looks absolutely beautiful, and I can't wait to explore it. Not to mention about halfway through the trailer we get to see some quality fishing gameplay. Why can't every game have fishing? In the video the player caught a nice sized Barracuda that looked like it could be consumed to replenish 150 HP.\nDespite how beautiful and honestly polished the open-world action-adventure title looked, there was no release date or timeframe.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdmoGYg8tB0\nWe first saw Crimson Desert during the 2020 Game Awards. It's been in development for quite some time now by developer Pearl Abyss, creator of Black Desert Online. It was originally announced as an MMORPG but by the end of 2020 Pearl Abyss announced that was no longer the case. Instead, Crimson Desert will intertwine a single-player and multiplayer experience.\nDespite its many flaws—and abhorrent pay-to-win mechanics,—Black Desert Online has one of the best combat systems ever in an MMORPG. Seeing Crimson Desert utilize an even more enhanced version of the combat system has me excited to try it out.\nThere is no release date yet for Crimson Desert, but we do know it is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Crimson Desert shows off beautiful world and even fishing, but still no release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

It wasn’t anything glamorous, but I got the opportunity during one of the lowest points in my life. COVID was in full swing, and I had lost my job. It helped me hold onto a shred of self-worth for a while. I faded off shortly after, but I enjoyed the time I spent collaborating with them.\nI didn’t work on WrestleQuest, though. The closest I came was when I was asked if it looked like one of the crowd members was flipping the middle finger.

          "description": "During Gamescom 2023, Blizzard revealed Season 2 for Diablo 4: Season of Blood. It looks like Blizzard will be following the originally promised quarterly release schedule for Diablo 4 seasons. Season of Blood will release on October 17, almost exactly three months after Season of the Malignant.\nAfter a pretty lackluster Season 1, hopefully Season of Blood adds more meaningful content, especially in the end-game of Diablo 4.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF65c670lpM\nThe announcement trailer didn't give us much information, other than that we'll be accompanying a new character named Erys. Erys is voiced by actress and producer Gemma Chan and leads the effort against a deadly new evil in Sanctuary. Based on the trailer, the new evil seems to be some blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures with extremely pointy teeth.\nAt the end of the trailer, we get a few quick glimpses of new features coming in Season of Blood. A new questline, new vampiric powers—which will probably replace the existing malignant hearts—and five new endgame bosses. Honestly, the endgame bosses could be pretty exciting, as that's currently a lacking feature of Diablo 4 compared to other ARPGs like Path of Exile.\nAlso, it appears we'll be getting updates to renown rewards, gem and stash storage, and resistances and status effects. Without concrete details it's hard to know how exactly to feel. But, all of these sound like good things, so I'm excited to find out more.\nDiablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, will release on all platforms on October 17.\nThe post Diablo 4 Season 2 is Season of Blood, starts October 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The perk system is getting overhauled, new weapons and vehicles are being added, and a number of systems and mechanics are getting brushed up. Not all of it looks completely revolutionary, but they did give a peak at the upgraded police system and showed off vehicular weaponry. Both of which I think will definitely improve the moments between narrative.\nhttps://youtu.be/zBrkG3aeWCc\nThey're also finally implementing a Relic upgrade screen. It was viewable on the base game, but for whatever reason, it wasn't implemented. When I played through, I was saving upgrade points for when it would eventually unlock, but I got impatient and looked it up and found out that there wasn't a talent tree for it. What a tease.\nThere are a few other bullet points that sound interesting, including an increased level cap, upgraded combat AI, and redesigned cyberware. I'm hoping that you can now have more visible cyberware, but I'm not holding my breath. I thought Cyberpunk 2077 was a bit up its own ass when it came to showing off its production values, but I'm still looking forward to the expansion.\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion releases on September 26, 2023.

With Gamescom underway, a new trailer is here to show off more of the sequel's action and intrigue.\nFlashback 2 has original creator Paul Cuisset teaming up with developer Microids Studio Lyon to put players back in the role of the young GBI agent, and this new trailer shows more of how the new release differs from the 1992 original. Previously confined to methodical side-scrolling movement and quick and deadly gunplay, Conrad's freedom has expanded. You can see the 2.5D potion in motion as Conrad rolls, jumps, and shoots below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7ei5RIgyzI\nHangin' tough\nFlashback 2 has other original team members on board in addition to Cuisset. This includes Thierry Perreau on game design and Amiga composer Raphael Gesqua. \nWhile it looks like a faster-paced take on the classic, it's nice to see Flashback 2 clinging to cinematic adventure game animations. The way Conrad hangs from ledges and performs all-important combat rolls should look familiar enough to longtime fans. Sure, they may have misspelled \"Washington\" in one of the cinematics, but it looks like a lot of care was put into bringing the battle against the Morphs to 2023.\nFlashback 2 spins its dystopian sci-fi yarn on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 16. It's going physical and digital on consoles, too, and the Collector's Edition packs in some extras for those who want to shout their Flashback love from the heart of their shelves.\nThe post Flashback 2 runs and guns in a fiery dystopian hell in Gamescom trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

During today's Opening Night Live, Cygames revealed its mobile game-turned-action-RPG will launch on February 1, 2024.\nFor those keeping track, yes—that is indeed a delay. Originally, the GBF open-world adventure was set to launch sometime this year, in 2023. The new date's trailer also showed off a few of Cygames' extra goodies, including a Deluxe and Collector's Edition. The beefier of the two includes a Proto Bahamut statue.\n[caption id=\"attachment_398156\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via thegameawards on Youtube[/caption]\nSo far, Cygames has confirmed several familiar faces from its gacha hit for Relink. We've seen series hero Lyria and her bodyguard, Katalina. The swordswoman Narmaya, dragonslayer Siegfried, ghostly Ferry, and, of course, both designs for the mobile version's silent player avatar. As you adventure with old and new series companions, players can invite a friend along for the ride; the GBF action game supports up to four players for co-op.\nhttps://twitter.com/gbf_relink_jp/status/1694062296656724270\nIt's been a long wait for folks eager to see some of their favorite 2D heroes get the full-fledged action RPG treatment. Relink's first announcement goes all the way back to 2016. That's back when we knew it as \"Project Re: Link,\" instead. After some developer limbo, a period of silence, and a change in studio involvement, we're finally getting there. Back in May, Relink made another appearance at the PlayStation showcase with its 2023 release window.\nPre-orders for the GBF RPG open on August 23, 2 am CEST.

          "description": "Gamescom 2023 has had quite a few vague \"this exists\" trailers, and Killing Floor 3 is one of them.\nLook, I really dig the staying power of the Killing Floor series. The second game in particular remained relevant for several years after its initial 2016 debut, well into its release on Xbox One a year later. It's a great take on the typical horde mode formula, and Tripwire Interactive spawned an entire diehard audience out of it. Now, a third entry is in the works.\nIf you're interested, here's a synopsis from Tripwire to hold you over:\n\"Killing Floor 3 is the next installment in the legendary co-op action/horror FPS series. The year is 2091, 70 years after the events in Killing Floor 2, and megacorp Horzine has produced the ultimate army: an obedient horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. Now, the only thing standing between these infernal creations and the future of humanity is the rebel rogue group known as Nightfall. This intense first-person shooter puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, joining forces with up to five teammates as they battle through a war-ravaged, dystopian future, surviving unrelenting waves of Zeds, unlocking new skills, and building the ultimate arsenal.\"\n\nOkay, an even more futuristic take on the series? I can work with that! It sounds like we could get even more lore tidbits this time around, with the clash between Nightfall and Horzine.\nKilling Floor 3 will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S for sure (with no prior generation console releases planned): but it currently has no release date, or even a release window.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Yq3fBkDTA\nThe post Killing Floor 3 is coming to PC and current-gen systems appeared first on Destructoid.",

A short teaser trailer for an update called \"The Final Horizon\" was unveiled, promising new story, new playable characters, and new challenges.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMbtrz3ut9w\nThe trailer itself isn't terribly illuminating on its own. We see a giant robot looking down on Sonic and friends, which goads Sonic into taking out some Chaos Emeralds. As a hedgehog naturally does, he goes Super Sonic shortly after, and the teaser ends. This might mean something to those who played Sonic Frontiers, I just didn't join Destructoid fast enough to cover it. That said, I know that Super Sonic always warrants celebration, so I'm excited for that!\nThough details on The Final Horizon remain scarce, we do know it will release for free. While Sonic Frontiers remains a somewhat divisive game, I'm happy that fans of the title will get a nice bonus for their loyalty. I'll be plenty curious to see how this update pans out when it launches on September 28.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers to get free The Final Horizon update on September 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

But as a studio, we’re committed to quality, and we take player satisfaction very seriously. We want to ensure that the game delivers on the expectations of our community, who have played a vital role in the development to date. We strive to ensure that Nightingale not only fulfills our vision but also becomes a cherished place for our players to explore and discover with their friends for many years to come.\"\n\nWith this trailer being titled \"Official Release Date Trailer\", surely this has to be the last delay, right?

At Gamescom 2023, a new trailer confirmed that the game will launch on January 26, 2024.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG_gUIaRQ8I\nAccompanying the release date, Tekken 8 producer Katsuhiro Harada teased a new mode called Arcade Quest. The trailer footage shows players making a custom avatar to bring into a virtual arcade, though we didn't see much more than that. We can confirm Arcade Mode is strictly a single player mode, so we know that much at least.\nAdditionally, the presentation noted that we'll see \"all new gameplay that actually has some AI kind of infused learning aspects to it\". Those words are as interesting as they are vague. Will we train characters as we advance through Arcade Quest? Your guess is as good as mine.\nAlso, while not a specific highlight of the trailer, our own Zoey \"The Yellow Dart\" Handley pointed out that Yoshimitsu makes his Tekken 8 debut here.

In typical Little Nightmares fashion, players will encounter signature elements including dubious puzzles and memorable monstrosities including the Monster Baby we see in the trailer.\nAlso, from a gameplay perspective, the sequel adds a new element. Both of the characters have their own unique items to progress through the journey. As such, teamwork will be a big part of the adventure with two-player online co-op. However, for those looking to play solo, you will still be able to do so. But instead of another player, AI will control the other character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFHOsobwFrA\nLittle Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2 are staple dark atmospheric adventure titles in my opinion.

Now, a new platform is getting on on the action. In addition to current-gen consoles and PC, Konami announced plans to bring the first volume of the Metal Gear Solid bundle to PlayStation 4.\nThe PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC versions were previously locked in for October 24. PS4 details are still TBD, however, so we'll have to wait for further info. For now, we know the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection will be digital-only on PS4. The PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch collections will be available both physically and digitally. \nhttps://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1693518300725366829\nBring back Ultra Games\nAs previously reported, Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection packs in some essential sneaking missions, including the MSX classics. In addition to Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, players can relive the stealth action of Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. \nThe NES version of Metal Gear I spent too long attempting to figure out back in the day is there, too, as is the less celebrated followup, Snake's Revenge. Much like the NES Metal Gear, creator Hideo Kojima was not involved in this sequel, and it shows. As a piece of gaming history, though, it's essential. Snake's Revenge reflects a company capitalizing on the popularity of an original title in international regions. Also, like most Ultra Games, the soundtrack — from composer Tsutomu Ogura — rips. \nAs for what lies beyond all this, we'll have to wait and see if those volume 2 leaks pan out whenever Konami gets around to detailing the next collection. \nThe post Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 adds digital PS4 version appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The recent Quake 2 remaster by Nightdive Studios is arguably the best way to experience the classic 1997 shooter. But could it be better? That's what one modder thinks, who's currently working on a path tracing mod.\nReddit user mStewart207 (as spotted by DSO Gaming) recently uploaded some images from their upcoming \"RTX Renderer\" project, which will aim to implement even greater lighting algorithms to the revamped version of Quake 2.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397928\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via mStewart207/Reddit.[/caption]\nJudging by the screenshots so far, it looks pretty great. The modder is aiming to publish it to GitHub \"as soon as it's more or less playable.\" We don't know when that will be, though.\nWhat is path tracing?\nThere are a lot of technical terms that get thrown around in this modern gaming era. From image upscaling to things like RTX and rasterization, it can be difficult to know what's going on when it comes to visual acuity.\nMany of you may already be aware of ray tracing, which is – in a nutshell – a piece of AI that uses the position of the player to make light and shadows look more realistic. But is this any different to path tracing? According to TechSpot, \"Path tracing differs from ray tracing in that instead of following lots of rays, throughout an entire scene, the algorithm only traces the most likely path for the light.\"\nIt's up to you to decide whether you understand that definition or not.\nAt the very least, it sounds like the remaster of Quake 2 could potentially look even better once this mod comes out. Who knew id Software's brown-and-gray FPS would get a second chance in the limelight?\nThe post Quake 2 remaster is now getting a path tracing mod as well appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's a quick look at what's coming to Season 14.\nHere's the full rundown from Bethesda on what to expect for Season 14\nThe team will continue to drop updates throughout the season, but the big focus right now is on the \"Fight for Freedom\" season pass track, as well as some upcoming quality-of-life enhancements that will be ready out of the gate.\n\"Season 14 features a variety of quality-of-life improvements, including lowered Perk Card requirements, streamlined Workbench changes along with a new free cam feature in Photo Mode. Active Fallout 1st subscribers will also receive bonus rewards as they level up.\"\n\nIt sounds small, but someone out there is likely freaking out (in a good way!) about just one of these enhancements.\nHere are the main features for Season 14:\nNew Ally: Grandma Junko is on a mission to find her grandchildren... she thinks.

However, the Amazon-owned site has recently tried to implement better features to help users moderate their channels, and it looks a new tool is on the way.\nAccording to a screenshot uploaded by streamer and partner Lowco (thanks, Eurogamer), Twitch plans on adding a way for content creators to block banned viewers from watching their streams. The image depicts a new setting that \"when enabled, banned users will not be able to watch your live broadcasts.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/LowcoTV/status/1691893134609813526\nCurrently, a Twitch ban only stops users from chatting, but they can still watch. Note that this new feature is not considered an IP ban, but Twitch's senior product manager Trevor Fisher says the company will look into feedback from streamers with the hope of making moderation tools more powerful.\nWhen are Twitch ban changes coming?\nUpdates to Twitch bans should roll out in September, available to all users interested in the new feature. We don't know what date exactly, but details should trickle in as Twitch implements changes from its Patch Note streams.\nBlocking users from watching streams (and chatting) won't stop them from being able to watch VODs or clips, though. Just as Fisher noted, maybe that's something the platform could implement in the future with enough feedback.\nWith viewership up, amassing around 1.8 billion watched hours for July 2023, Twitch retains its position as the number one place for streaming content.

In 2022, it was pushed to this year and then delayed again after missing its June 15 release date.\nhttps://twitter.com/KOOPMode/status/1693691706737103311\nIts August 29 launch date appears to be the one to stick, as KO_OP has announced that the game has gone gold. The announcement congratulates the team for their \"huge achievement\", which is understandable, as it appears development was a trying process.

In a PlayStation blog post, KO_OP described it as a cinematic game that's meant to feel like binging on a series, though \"unlike with TV, you’ll have the power and the emotion in your hands as you guide our characters through a branching narrative.\"\nThe game has rhythm elements to complement its musical themes and features an original soundtrack by Montreal-based artist Dabu. A demo of Goodbye Volcano High is available on Steam for players to discover more about what the game has in store.\nThe post Goodbye Volcano High has finally gone gold appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the remarkable success of Remnant 2 has shown that there's still a substantial market for smaller, more contained experiences. Remnant 2's sales have been so remarkable, in fact, that the game managed to dethrone Diablo 4 last month, skyrocketing to the very top of the July list of bestsellers.\nThis information comes from Mat Piscatella, a renowned gaming industry analyst who often posts sales information on his Twitter account.

          "description": "Atari has partnered with Plaion to recreate its classic entry in the console landscape. The Atari 2600+ will play games from both the 2600 and 7800 consoles.\nThe Atari 2600+ is based on the classic wood-grained, four-switch model of the console, which has become the most recognizable look for it. It comes with a reproduction CX40 controller and supports USB power and HDMI. Also, the Atari logo lights up when it’s on. It comes packed in with a 10-in-1 cartridge that has a selection of classic games.\nhttps://youtu.be/SgAcNwG5vCo\nThe store page also says that it has “been lovingly recreated to the same specifications as the original,” which is kind of vague. I mostly want to know whether the hardware is similar to the original, if it uses FPGA, or if it’s software emulation. It sounds like the latter since it touts a Rockchip 3128 SOC microprocessor. Most games are compatible, as seen in this list. The Atari 2600+’s HDMI is certainly tantalizing since the hardware had previously only supported RF-out. I had actually modified my personal Atari 2600 to support composite out. Modern TVs, even late-era CRTs, tend to hate RF signals.\nI wish more companies would do this. Being a retro gamer progressively requires more soldering skills to maintain and modify consoles to work on modern setups. Would I buy an official NES from Nintendo that supports HDMI? Absolutely yes. On the other hand, would I buy a reproduction Atari Jaguar? Yeah, actually, I totally would. The fact that Atari has even gotten into producing new titles for their old consoles is just more tempting.\nThe Atari 2600+ is available for preorder now for $129.99 USD. The console is expected to ship November 2023.\nThe post Atari 2600+ is an official recreation of the classic console appeared first on Destructoid.",

For instance, he has mentioned that Rebel Moon will be receiving a video game adaptation. Not many details have been revealed, though Snyder has excitedly stated that it is an RPG that is “literally insane and so immersive and so intense and so huge.” It wouldn’t be a surprise to discover that his announcement involves the upcoming Rebel Moon game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397886\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Gamescom.[/caption]\nGamescom 2023 is finally upon us\nGamescom begins with Opening Night Live today at 11 AM PDT.

          "description": "Sometimes it's hard to imagine that No Man's Sky came out seven years ago! What was once the most controversial game in recent history (with accusations of false advertising thrown about) is easily now one of the best sci-fi games of the previous (or even current) generation. And now even more content is on the way.\nA recent video from the guys at Hello Games acknowledges the time that has passed with a special anniversary video. It showcases all the major changes and free DLC that have been implemented over the past seven years.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj_TLfNmSQY\nThen, right at the end, a brief announcement that \"ECHOES\" is on the way. We don't know what this is, other than it being some new No Man's Sky content.\nSean Murray teases Twitter once more\nTypically, when it comes to updates for the procedurally generated universe simulator, the studio's own Sean Murray will tease what's coming next.\nThis one is no different, but a tweet from the man himself doesn't really clue us in. With previous updates, Murray will often upload a single emoji to his Twitter account, often alluding to what fans can expect next.\nHowever, with \"ECHOES,\" all we get is some question marks, which really only adds to the mystery. Suffice it to say, fans will be excited to see what No Man's Sky has in store.\nhttps://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1692521575730274375\nAccording to the game's Wiki page, there have been 24 updates since it launched in 2016. All of which have been free. The studio may have started out on the wrong foot but NMS now has a strong following. We don't yet know when the next major patch is coming out, but it shows just how committed the team has been in making sure this mind-bogglingly large game just gets bigger and bigger.\nThe post No Man’s Sky Turns 7, ECHOES content teased appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It seems like Fall Guys has been making the rounds lately. I mean, sure, the game has kind of been everywhere since it launched back in 2020. But its collaboration momentum certainly shows no signs of slowing down. So hot on the heels of Fall Guys coming to Final Fantasy XIV, we have official confirmation that the upcoming Super Bomberman R 2 will dip its hands into the Fall Guys pot as well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Xm66vWDNE\nThese two franchises have certainly enjoyed a good relationship up to this point. After all, Super Bomberman R Online had already crossed over with Fall Guys in 2021. What makes this one a bit interesting, though, is that Super Bomberman R 2 will have the… guy from Fall Guys shortly after launch. It’ll arrive on September 14, to be specific. Called the “Bean Bomber” here, you’ll be able to unlock the little fellow from the title’s in-game store.\nThe Bean will join a few other cameo characters that were previously pointed out by Destructoid’s own Zoey “corn chips are no place for a mighty warrior” Handley. These include the likes of Dracula and Princess Tomato, making Super Bomberman R 2 something of a crossover fest. Considering it’s hard to tell when and if we’ll ever see a lot of these classic Konami characters, I'll welcome these small cameos when I can.\nSuper Bomberman R 2 will launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 13.

Now, the studio has formally unveiled The Final Shape, the expansion concluding this decade-long story arc, and it launches on February 27, 2024. \nBungie says in The Final Shape, Guardians will confront their ultimate adversary, The Witness, alongside companions from their years of adventures in Destiny 2, like Ikora Rey, Commander Zavala, and Cayde-6, who has somehow returned after dying in the game’s Forsaken expansion.

Teased today at Gamescom, the next pack of content, known as \"The Final Horizon\" update, is the most exciting yet, promising new story, new challenges, and even new playable characters.\n\n\nThe teaser itself doesn't give us much to go on. Sonic and friends stand on the edge of a cliff, ready to face a massive Titan. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are all candidates to be playable characters in the future, but there's no indication of that here – Sonic summons the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic, ready to face off against this mysterious threat, then powers up yet again as he races toward the Titan.\nFor any more details, we'll have to wait until the full update drops on September 28, just over a month from now. If you're itching for more Sonic news, check out the latest issue of our digital magazine to learn about Sonic Superstars. You can also learn about its newly announced release date.",

In a month that already features the likes of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Forza Motorsport, and Cities: Skylines II, we have another high-profile game that will contend with our precious free time. Sonic Superstars joins the mix with a release date of October 17.\nSonic Superstars brings the Classic Sonic action into a more modernized setting with 3D visuals and myriad new powers. It's also the first Sonic game to feature true cooperative play. As our most recent cover story, we've played and talked a lot about Sonic Superstars, including an exclusive look at every Emerald Power in the game, plus a first look at several never-before-seen zones.\nThis announcement also brought us a look at other multiplayer modes, which you can see in the trailer below.\n\n\nSonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17. That date puts it the same week as another highly anticipated 2D game from one of gaming's most fabled and beloved franchises, as Super Mario Bros. Wonder arrives on October 20.

These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.\nYou can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. \nSimilar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals. \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.",

It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. \nCheck out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. \n“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” \n\nPearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. \nFor more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.\nAre you excited about Crimson Desert?

The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. \nAtari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. \n\n\nThe 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:\nAdventure\nCombat\nDodge ‘Em\nHaunted House\nMaze Craze\nMissle Command\nRealsports Volleyball\nSurround\nVideo Pinball\nYar’s Revenge\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\nThe Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.",

Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: \n\n\nIn The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.\n“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.\nStarward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” \n\nThe Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here. \nThe Invincible hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. \nAre you going to check out The Invincible later this year?

Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies & TV app will stop working altogether.\nHowever, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you'll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.\nAdditionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn't encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform's most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today's announcement post. Here's the most recent batch from November 2021:\nFor more Xbox 360 nostalgia, you can revisit our top 25 Xbox 360 games of all time.\nAre there any Xbox 360 games you'll be rushing to grab before the store closes?

Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. \nAlan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. \nAlan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.",

          "description": "When The Messenger was released in 2018, Thierry Boulanger went into its launch with reasonable expectations. He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...",

          "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge's big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. \nThe expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.\n\n\nDimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character. \nTo learn more about why we think TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is the best Turtles game in decades, read our review here.",

While the results have been hit or miss over the last few years, EA Sports aims to deliver myriad updates to NHL 24 to make it feel more authentic to the real-life game of hockey than ever before.\nIt all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn't as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots.

Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.\nCrimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. \nNext Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.\nhttps://t.co/AFycLZG9XF pic.twitter.com/mEj030uEQN\nAugust 16, 2023\nThe game's presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.\n\n\nCrimson Desert doesn't have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We'll likely find out of that's still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.",

However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they're done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold and is coming out a week early! 📀\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/eWAZttvjIX\nAugust 14, 2023\nThe game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.\nIn an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it's a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur's Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with \"other RPGs,\" which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage's new date doesn't seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.\nHow do you feel about developers advancing their release dates? Let us know in the comments!",

South Park: Snow Day looks to carry on the series' legacy of over-the-top and mature-rated humor while still viewing life through the eyes of children. \nStarring the core group of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, players take part in celebrations surrounding the magical occasion of a snow day. Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.\n\n\nWe don't have many more details surrounding the title, but the game is in development by Question Games, a  studio based in California and Virginia. In the past, the studio has worked on The Blackout Club and The Magic Circle. South Park: Snow Day! is set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2024.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.\nIn the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. \"Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.\"\n\n\nAccording to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in gaming, be sure to check out our review of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and our in-depth impressions of TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.",

          "description": "A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.\nWe have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:\nAdded ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.\nFixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.\nAdded multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.\nWe also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.\nThank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!\n>",
