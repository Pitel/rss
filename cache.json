And with the new footage that dropped alongside news of the delay, so too did discussions around just how good it looked. In their weekly discussion, the team over at Digital Foundry brought up those lovely visuals recently. It looks like Breath of the Wild 2 was running extra smooth — perhaps too smooth.\nThe DF chaps went on to discuss suspicions that Breath of the Wild 2 could potentially be a cross-generation game that straddles both current hardware and a Switch successor — much like Breath of the Wild did with the previous generation. After some very enthusiastic reportage from some corners of the internet, this week they reiterated that no, that doesn't mean BOTW2 is not coming to Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developed by Matthias Linda and published by Deck13, who was responsible for bringing us the fantastic action RPG CrossCode, the game more than doubled its Kickstarter goal back in 2019, and one of the stretch goals included bringing the game to Switch!\nWe're finally going to see the fruits of this Kickstarter's success towards the end of the year, as Chained Echoes is projected to launch sometime in Q4 2022. The turn-based RPG already sported a gorgeous SNES-style visual flair back when it was announced, but it's really come into its own with a crisp, colourful world that blends a fantasy dragon landscape with Mechs!

Where Tengo Project’s Wild Guns Reloaded and Ninja Warriors Once Again were deliciously pumped-up remasters, Pocky & Rocky Reshrined is a re-envisioning so markedly different from the original that it’s essentially an entirely new game. Completely redrawn from the ground up, it’s nothing short of magical from the flute note ditty that dials-in the opening title screen to the first stretch of road and beyond. Fallen leaves are displaced as you skid across them, floating back down to settle on the cobbles; weather effects desaturate the world with sepia flashes; the special effects, particularly surrounding boss entrances, are dazzling.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The much-beloved sixth entry in the legendary Final Fantasy series — which celebrates its 35th anniversary this year — rarely gets much attention from Square Enix. That's despite a successful PC and mobile remaster earlier this year as part of the Pixel Remaster series, which we desperately want on the Switch.\nWell, perhaps there's a reason there hasn't been much merch for Final Fantasy VI — for one big blow-out celebration.

Arriving over five years after the system launched, its place in the library is a little different as a result, and in the latest Japanese commercial we see Nintendo tying the game to Ring Fit Adventure as a natural part of an exercise routine.

This can be in the form of iconic music or even video clips to tie games into real history, a clever bit of storytelling often deployed in the Metal Gear series. Of course, licensed content often has an agreement expiry date, which impacted a number of legacy Metal Gear releases last year.\nAmong many other versions across different systems, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D dropped off the 3DS eShop last November. It disappeared on 8th November last year - Konami cited \"historical archive footage\" as the issue and promised it was a temporary measure, though having checked this morning the game is still missing on the EU eShop.

And if someone had a Wii, it was likely that they also had Wii Sports. The universality of Wii Sports was unstoppable. Motion controls certainly had their... off moments, but Wii Sports embraced the ease of swinging a Wii Remote around. You could play it, your parents could play it, your grandparents could probably thrash you at bowling — everyone could play it. It embraced Nintendo's family-friendly philosophy better than almost anything else before it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yet we're now decades into the history of gaming, especially if you go back to the systems of the 1970s, perhaps even a little earlier. Even if you choose to focus on the 'modern' post-crash era of gaming, we're rapidly approaching 40 years within that narrower perspective.\nWe see this every day as fans, of course - franchises like The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog are over 30-35 years old.

His best friends, of course, are dogs. Their leader is a spicy little chihuahua named T. Juan who does all the talking on behalf of the gang, and together Alpha and the pack fight off a horde of Mad Max-esque frat bros who have imprisoned dozens of dogs because… whatever, it doesn’t matter. The Last Friend's plot is nonsensical, but in the best of ways, and it’s really just there as set dressing to give some goofy context to the gameplay.\nEach stage has you playing in a Plants vs. Zombies-like tower defense map, where your vulnerable RV is parked on the left and it’s up to Alpha and the goodest of bois to keep the frat bros attacking from the right from trashing it. You always have direct control over Alpha, who can freely jump between the three-to-five lanes in each level, beating up bad guys and ordering the dogs where to build their defenses. Every felled enemy will drop some scrap, which you can then spend on constructing more dog units or to upgrade existing ones. It’s a simple but effective system, buoyed by both the diversity of dog types on offer and the fast-paced action offered by Alpha’s controls. If you don’t want to wait for the dogs to do all the work, Alpha has a series of basic beat ‘em up-style combo attacks for putting down foes quicker.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for £10 more. Either way, you'll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia's higher-end GPUs and much less than the company's next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year. \nRead more",

          "description": "Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.\nThe game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.\nRead more",

Yet it also hints vaguely at what’s coming in Season 3 – now starting all the way off on November 8th, with the open beta for Forge from September. 343 cite “quality of life” lessons from Season 1, along with the sensible goal of maintaining team health, for the extension.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more. \nRead more",

While we were out at PAX East 2022, we tracked down the director of upcoming roguelike Cursed To Golf, Liam Edwards. As well as asking him about the enduring appeal of sunny green fairways, we also putted our way through its excellent PAX East demo, discovering this golflike is anything but cursed.\nRead more",

That gives you a sharp image, good fluidity for fast-paced games and the technologies to smooth out uneven frame-rates with little input lag - and all at a reasonable price. These sort of monitors normally cost around $300, but today retailer Antonline is selling the well-reviewed Lenovo G27Q for just $200 - after a mega $150 reduction. \nI think it's the best monitor deal I've seen for months, so let me tell you more about it. \nRead more",

It's only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they're often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it's not only good, it's doing things completely differently.\nIt's a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I'd be very surprised if you don't enjoy it.\nRead more",

The Glaivier features two skill sets, Focus and Flurry, linked to one of the ridiculously huge pointy sticks she wields: spear for fast attacks in Focus and glaive for sweeping hits in Flurry. Smilegate say a successful Glaivier can maximise their effectiveness by building up energy with one skill set for a stat boost when swapping to the other.

That's a fair price for a laptop with good mid-level specs, including an 11th-gen Core i5 11400H processor (6C/12T), 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD and a 15-in 1080p 144Hz screen. \nLenovo make some of the best gaming laptops in the business, where their clean design, solid build quality and reliability have set them apart from other brands that tend to be a little plasticky at the sub-£1000 price points where most laptops are sold. \nRead more",

It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.\nIt's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for. \nRead more",

Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. \nIf you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810.

There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway.

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. \nI’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets. \nRead more",

Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.\nI was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.\nRead more",

It’s technically possible to swap in a bigger SSD, sure, but compatible M.2 2230 drives are much harder to find than the standard 2280 drives on our best gaming SSDs list – and based on my testing, a good microSD card can be just about as fast as the Deck’s preinstalled SSD.\r\n\n\r\nThat’s on top of microSD cards being cheaper, easier to install, easier to remove, and available with much more choice than Steam Deck-compatible SSDs. That’s not to say that any old card will work – Valve’s handheld PC specifically supports UHS-1 microSD cards – but I’ve found and tested a few that will do the job, and do it well. \r\n\n \nRead more",

We weren't seeded by AMD for this launch, leading us to anticipate that it's not too good for Linux gaming / not their target market. But after the great success I've had with AMD Milan-X performance on Linux, I was very eager to try out this consumer CPU with the 3D-stacked L3 cache and ended up purchasing a 5800X3D. Indeed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D turned out to be disappointing for Linux gaming performance but the 5800X3D was very interesting for a range of other technical workloads and making me very excited for future Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache.",

As Eurogamer reported at the time, Project Q was one of four codenamed titles listed by Ubisoft, who issued a DCMA takedown of the list once it hit online.  \nThe French publisher confirmed Project Q’s existence on Twitter on Saturday, stating that the game is in early development and that players can register for upcoming gameplay tests. The timeframe for these tests is unknown. Ubisoft subsequently clarified in the same Twitter thread that Project Q is not a battle royale and will feature several PvP modes. It also states there are no plans to add NFTs to the game, evidently a concern given Ubisoft’s enthusiastic foray into the concept with its ill-received Quartz platform. \nSo, we heard you heard... 🤷\nhttps://t.co/TMRKwiUzbJ pic.twitter.com/hZ40OkPdum\nApril 23, 2022\nLeaked playtest footage from Exputer shows a couple of matches from the game. It appears to be a colorful third-person shooter not unlike Fortnite with zany weapons such as a fireworks gun and melee items such as a staff and even Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir. \nAccording to Project Q’s registration site, the game is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Ubisoft Connect. It does not have a release window.  \nIn other recent Ubisoft news, several private firms are apparently looking to acquire the publisher. In terms of other new multiplayer titles, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development.",

          "description": "We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. We kick things off by examining their debut outing, Bastion.\nBastion launched on Xbox Live Arcade on July 20, 2011, and was created by a ragtag team of seven friends that formed the core of Supergiant (all of whom remain at the studio today). Developed under two years entirely in co-founder Amir Rao's father's living room, Bastion gave the upstart team a chance to create the game of their dreams after spending years working for triple-A studios. We'll discuss Bastion's unorthodox development cycle (it had no pre-production phase), the origins of beloved elements such as its narrator and soundtrack, and how the game's success launched Supergiant into stardom.  \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Prima Games staff writer Jesse Vitelli (@jessevitelli) for an entertaining and informative chat about the history and narrative of Bastion! You can also decide which one of us does the best narrator impression.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "It's no secret that the Halo series has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Episode one saw an exciting introduction to both the iconic Spartans and the brutal Covenant forces that seek to tear humanity apart. \nBut then we got weeks of melodrama and ill-paced storylines that made us question if we wanted to continue with the show. Episode five, titled \"Reckoning,\" is a stark reminder of why this series has so much potential, and we're breaking it all down on this special edition of The Game Informer Show!\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Andrew Reiner as they bring on Kate Sanchéz, EIC and entertainment critic for But Why Tho?, to discuss and spoil the fantastic battle and more from this week's entry in the Paramount Plus series. We start the proceedings off by gauging Kate's level of enjoyment for the show and blow through some of the other less exciting plot points to get to the good stuff.\nWe also touch on the thankfully brief encounters with Soren and Kwan as they trek through the desert, en route to Madrigal. While that storyline continues to suffer, it wasn't much of a deterrent, as the panel all walked away from this week's show excited for what's to come.\nProgramming Note: Our Episode six review will premiere on Monday, May 1, instead of the regular Friday timeslot. This is due to a particular video editor and his need to take a vacation. We appreciate your patience and look forward to continuing the series review!\nWhat do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

As for how this fight plays into the actual battle royale that is Call of Duty: Warzone, that remains unclear. Save for one of the Warzone planes going down after being grabbed out of the sky by King Kong, the soldiers we play as in the game are nowhere to be seen.\nYou can check out the teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nOperation Monarch will go live on May 11, but hopefully before then, we learn more about how Godzilla and King Kong will actually affect Call of Duty: Warzone. Perhaps they’ll replace the ever-enclosing circle, or perhaps they’ll just be fighting in the background. Regardless, here’s hoping we get some cool skins and customization options related to the kaiju out of this. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Vanguard review and then read about how a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sequel and new Warzone game are confirmed for 2022.

These three games join the recently-added Sega Genesis games, Altered Beast, ToeJam & Earl, Dynamite Headdy, Sword of Vermilion, and Thunder Force II, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, which was added to the service back in January. You can check out all three new Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack games in the trailer below: \n\n\nSpace Harrier II\nSpace Harrier II was first released in 1988 and was one of the original launch titles for the Mega Drive (what the Sega Genesis was known as in Japan) and one of the six Sega Genesis launch titles in the U.S. Nintendo says Space Harrier II is “a celebrated launch title for the Genesis/Mega Drive,” and that “in this sequel to the popular 3D shoot-em-up, Harrier takes to the skies once more to defend Fantasy Land from a mysterious invader.” \nShining Force II\nShining Force II is a tactical RPG released in 1993 and while it is a sequel for the franchise, it’s not a direct sequel to the first shining force. Nintendo says this “second entry in the popular tactical-RPG series” features “even more strategic combat.” In it, “Sir Astral’s squire, Bowie, must assemble an army of light from all the world’s races to stop evil from overtaking the land.” \nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball\nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball is the first of the pinball-related spinoffs in the Sonic franchise. Originally released for the Mega Drive in 1993, Nintendo says “the world’s fastest hedgehog bursts onto the pinball scene in an all-new adventure,” and that “in this action pinball game anyone can pick up and enjoy, gather the Chaos Emeralds, and save four worlds from Dr. Robotnik.” \nAre you excited about any of these Sega Genesis games?

The company announced today a popular Borderlands spinoff is returning this year with the return of Tales from the Borderlands.\nIn a tweet this afternoon from the Borderlands official Twitter account, it was revealed that Tales from the Borderlands would be receiving a second season, and Gearbox only lists it and 2K Games as being attached to the project. The tweet reads, \"There are more stories to explore in the Borderlands universe. An all-new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficail and @2K. Stay tuned for a full announcement this summer.\" The message came with a piece of art featuring three characters under the Borderlands logo with a big moon shining in the background.\nThere are more stories to explore in the #Borderlands universe. An all new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficial and @2K.\npic.twitter.com/xsFbRZ5eHo\nApril 21, 2022\nThe previous developer for season one of Tales of the Borderlands, Telltale Games, isn't mentioned in the announcement, which makes sense as that company has taken more of a publishing role since it was shuttered and resurrected over the past few years. It's unknown whether this new edition of Tales from the Borderlands will continue on with characters from the first season or move on to other stories within the universe. \nSeason one of Tales of the Borderlands is an adventure game following the exploits of former Hyperion employee Rhys and con artist Fiona in the rough yet humorous world of Pandora. You can read why former Game Informer editor Javy Gwaltney loves this game in this opinion piece describing how it's his favorite entry in the entire Borderlands series.

The narrative centers on the player character, who hails from a futuristic city, playing what they believe to be a virtual reality game called Soul Divers. However, they discover the fantasy world they’ve entered is very much real, and a mysterious girl named Rania tasks you with rebuilding her world’s kingdom to save both of your realities. \nPlayers suit up as one of five classes: Swordsman, Witch, Engineer, Rogue, and Destroyer. You’ll explore an expansive world filled with NPCs to befriend and monsters to slay, as well as collect Familiars that can be tamed to fight alongside you. The Kingdom can be built up and decorated using interactive objects along with maintaining your own personal farm. Multiplayer includes both PvE and PvP modes.  \nPre-registering on the App Store or Google Play gets you the Explorer’s Outfit.

          "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge finally has a release window, and the hotly-anticipated throwback is set to arrive sometime this summer. \nA new extended gameplay trailer shows off the game’s first two levels with all four Turtles getting a spotlight. Publisher Dotemu also brings exciting news that the Turtles' original voice actors from the 1987 cartoon reprise their roles in Shredder’s Revenge. The action gets another big dose of nostalgia with Cam Clarke (Leonardo), Townsend Coleman (Michelangelo), Barry Gordon (Donatello), and Rob Paulsen (Raphael) spouting one-liners in the midst of battle as a result. \n\n\nThose attending PAX East this week have the opportunity to play Shedder’s Revenge for the first time at Dotemu’s expo hall booth (#12043, if you’re curious). The rest of us will have to wait to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Dotemu announced that Limited Run Games will produce physical copies of the digital-only title sometime after launch. Shredder's Revenge's soundtrack, composed by Tee Lopes, will get a digital release down the line as well. \nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, check out our recent gameplay preview here.",

This will be the first time these cyberpunk-fantasy RPGs have ever been released on console, having been previously exclusive to PC. The trilogy includes three games, as the name suggests: the original PC game, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director’s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition, all fully remastered. \n\n\n“The Shadowrun Trilogy, a remastered release of the Shadowrun Returns RPGs originally released by Harebrained Schemes, has been updated for a console experience, with upscaled graphics, improved performance, and controller-optimized gameplay,” a press release reads. “All three titles in the series will launch simultaneously for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and are available for preorder on all platforms as of today.” \nShadowrun Returns was originally funded via Kickstarter in just 28 hours, and it was the first Kickstarter-funded game to launch after raising more than $1 million on the fundraising platform, according to the press release. Shadowrun Returns, and the rest of the trilogy, is based on the Shadowrun tabletop RPG created by Jordan Weisman, who also helped design Shadowrun Returns. \nShadowrun Trilogy will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on June 21 and it will cost $39.99. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s reviews of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. \nAre you excited for this remastered release of the Shadowrun Trilogy?

Johnson will produce the film on behalf of Seven Bucks Production, alongside Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia, and dj2 Entertainment will help produce it as well. \n\n\nVariety reports that its sources say that Johnson could also star in the film, but that’s obviously not official yet. As expected, this film adaptation of 2021’s It Takes Two, which won Game Of The Year at The Game Awards 2021 in December, will follow main characters May and Cody who are turned into dolls by their daughter amidst divorce proceedings. May and Cody must work together to explore fantasized areas of their home to regain their bodies while confronting the issues of their relationship.\nIt’s one of the best games of 2021, and you can find out why in Game Informer’s It Takes Two review. The film could shape up to be just as good, based on the team behind it. Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller are adapting the game for the silver screen, according to Variety, and they will also serve as executive producers alongside Hazelight Studios’ Josef Fares, who directed the game version of It Takes Two. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s It Takes Two review and then check out our thoughts on Fares’ other games, like A Way Out and Brothers – A Tale Of Two Sons. \n[Source: Variety]\nAre you excited about a film adaptation of It Takes Two?

          "description": "Sony has delayed Spider-Man: Across The Universe, the highly anticipated sequel to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, from Oct. 7 to June 2, 2023. \nThis marks a nearly eight-month delay for the animated sequel that is set to star Shameik Moore and Hailey Steinfeld as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, respectively, as reported by Deadline. When Across The Spider-Verse was previously revealed, it was shown to be a Part I, with Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Part II slated to release after it. More specifically, it’s dated for March 29, 2024. \nAs for why this delay has happened, that remains unclear. Sony hasn’t stated why Across The Spider-Verse Part I has been delayed. However, considering we’re in a pandemic, it’s possible the delay is related to COVID-19, which has caused delays across the movie industry, games industry, and more. Or perhaps, more simply, the filmmaking team needs more time. \nInto The Spider-Verse made roughly $375 million worldwide at the box office and considering the franchise is even more popular now than it was upon release, there’s a good chance Across The Spider-Verse easily eclipses that. Only time will tell, though. \nDeadline’s report also states that Sony’s other animated movie, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile has moved up from its Nov. 18 date to Oct. 7, taking Across The Spider-Verse’s original release date. Elsewhere in Sony’s somewhat disjointed Spider-Man-related universe, Madame Web, which will star Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney and Fifty Shades Of Grey’s Dakota Johnson, has received a July 7, 2023 release date. \nWhile waiting for Across The Spider-Verse, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review to find out why it’s a great Spider-Man game, and then check out the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that. If you need even more comic book games in your life, watch this reveal of Insomniac’s Wolverine game. \n[Source: Deadline]\nAre you excited for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse?

          "description": "Moss: Book II will only be a PlayStation VR exclusive for a short time because the adventure will soon be available on the Meta Quest 2 headset. Developer Polyarc announced during the Meta Quest Showcase today that Moss II would arrive on the platform this summer.\nMoss II on Meta Quest 2 will have more freedom in the way it's played, according to Polyarc. The move to a newer headset like the Quest allows players to utilize both Quest controllers as opposed to a single DualShock controller like in the PS5/PS4 edition. Polyarc says it lets players perform actions such as engaging with the weapon inventory system during combat.\n“One of the first things we heard when we launched Moss: Book II on PlayStation VR a few weeks ago was that the Quest 2 community wanted to play it, and we’re going to deliver on that in the very near future,” said Polyarc CEO Tam Armstrong, in a press release shared with Game Informer. “Our goal from day one has been getting the Moss franchise onto as many headsets as possible. We want all VR players to have the opportunity to experience the joy of physical interaction and power of the emotional resonance we’ve been building into the worlds we create. We’re excited to share our game with millions of Quest 2 players around the world this summer.”\nAn exact release date was not shared for Moss: Book II, but we can't wait to try it out on a Quest 2 sometime this summer. If you want to dig into Moss: Book II and have a PlayStation VR, the game is ready to download and play there.",

          "description": "Sega formally unveiled Sonic Origins today, a remastered and enhanced collection of classic Sonic games arriving this June. It also revealed that the title comes in two editions along with a few pre-order bonus packs. \nThe game’s website shares a chart (pictured above) breaking down each version of the game and various pre-order bonuses. If you’re having trouble making sense of it, we don't blame you. It's confusing at first glance, so here’s a plain breakdown of what it entails. \nThe Standard Edition, which is just the game, costs $39.99. The Digital Deluxe version runs for $44.99 and includes the game plus the following items: \nHard Missions\nLetterbox background\nCharacter animation in main menu\nCamera controls over main menu islands\nCharacter animations during music islands\nExclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles\nWith us so far? Good. Now, there are three content packs, two of which are unavailable for purchase at the moment. They are: \nStart Dash Pack (included with digital pre-orders of Standard or Digital Deluxe Editions)\n100 Medallion bonus\nMirror Mode unlocked\nLetterbox background (Genesis/Mega Drive Pattern)\nPremium & Classic Sound Packs (Coming soon)\nExclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles\nPremium Fun Pack (Coming soon)\nHard missions\nLetterbox background\nCharacter animation in main menu\nCamera controls over main menu islands\nCharacter animations during music islands\nBasically, the Classic Sound and Fun Packs are just the bonuses included in the Digital Deluxe edition but slightly divided. Hopefully that helped you figure out what you're getting and where. \nSonic Origins launches June 23 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

That’s right; you can finally smash through Sonic 1’s Marble Zone as Knuckles. \nIf you’d rather keep it vintage, a Classic Mode lets players enjoy these games in their original forms. Conversely, Anniversary Mode features a full-screen display and infinite lives for those who want to tour each adventure stress-free. Sonic Origins incentivizes gameplay with new in-game missions that reward medallions. Spending this currency in the game’s Vault unlocks new content and grants access to a Special Stage. Origins also sports new cutscenes in the style of Sonic Mania's animated cinematics.\n\n\nSonic Origins launches on June 23 – Sonic’s 31st birthday – on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The Standard Edition runs for $39.99, but there are two versions and a few content packs you can read all about here. \nTo learn more about Sonic the Hedgehog's history, check out our June 2021 interview with Sonic Team's leader Takashi Iizuka about Sonic Origins as well as the franchise's 30-year history here.",

This new area looks especially frozen, with plenty of icy terrain and frost-covered enemies to defeat.\nYou can watch the Coiled Captors launch trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it features more of the zany and wacky adventures those who have played Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands are already familiar with. The trailer also reveals that Coiled Captors comes with a new frozen dungeon and in it, you must free the “mad god.” Gearbox says each week, the challenge evolves with powerful new gear, wondrous new cosmetics, and more. \nCoiled Captors looks great, especially if you’re in need of new Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands content and fortunately, you don’t have to wait long, or at all really, because this DLC is available now. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands review and then check out all the details we know about Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands’ season pass, which includes four content drops.
