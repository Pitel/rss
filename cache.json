          "description": "Secret of the Snooze.\nIt has been a little over a year since Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in cinemas, and a lot has changed for the heroes in a half-shell. Shredder's Revenge has welcomed not one, but two DLC packs, THQ Nordic has announced a Last Ronin adaptation and, in 2024 alone, the Switch has already landed a pair of new TMNT releases. In short, when Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games announced they were working on a tie-in to the 2023 movie, our reaction was something along the lines of, \"Yeah, that sounds about right.\"\nOne year on, and we are quite frankly impressed at how ambitious that tie-in turned out to be. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed packs an entire follow-up story into its 15-hour runtime with wonderful voice acting and far more Persona (yes!) influence than we ever would have expected. It's very much not without its flaws — the combat is repetitive, the plot feels bloated, and the performance on Switch regularly moves at a snail's (or should that be turtle's?) pace — but it does aim for something slightly different, and that deserves praise.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sadly, a new report suggests that the team behind the excellent Metroidvania has been disbanded by Ubisoft, and a sequel was refused.\nAccording to French gaming journalist Gautoz on the Origami YouTube channel (and summarised by ResetEra User Arubedo), Ubisoft had determined the game's future a few weeks after the game's January 2024 launch. The company made it clear to the team at Ubisoft Montpellier that after all the cosmetics and DLC were out, \"it would be the end.\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Indie releases such as Kaze and the Wild Masks, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, and Marsupilami: Hoobadventure have all done an exceptional job of emulating the things that made DK’s old side-scrolling romps so enjoyable and now another contender has stepped up to the plate.\nNikoderiko: The Magical World, the inaugural release of Cyprus-based VEA Games, not only does a great job of recreating DK’s best adventures with its own twist, but it takes things a step further by also calling back to the gameplay style of some other classic platformer mascots. And while, yes, one could make the argument that Nikoderiko is a little too comfortable riding the coattails of the classics without adding many of its own ideas, it does such a good job of capturing what made those games great that it hardly matters. Nikoderiko doesn’t eclipse the projects that served as its clear inspirations, but it provides an enjoyable and challenging platforming adventure that we’d suggest to any fans of the genre.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.\nIt's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound.

          "description": "Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

It'll cost $30 on Steam, Itch, and GOG.   \r\n\r\nOriginal story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: \"{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?\" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release.

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.\nStreets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word \"UNAVAILABLE\" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.\nRead more",

I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour.

It's set in a world “conceived by the leads” of the canceled sequel.\nA representative of Longdue told us that \"the studio isn't ready to talk about specific names at the moment beyond the people mentioned in the press release, but they are looking forward to sharing more about the game and the studio in the future\". They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.\nRead more",

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. \nIt’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.\n Read more",

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.\r\n \nRead more",

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.\nSpeaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have \"higher expectations\" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.\n Read more",

You'll need four ingredients throughout the game to make this gastronomic spectacle.\n\n\nAll Poached Basil Butter Sturgeon Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo make this four-star dish, you'll require the following ingredients:\n\n\n\nWhite Sturgeon\n\n\nButter\n\n\nBasil\n\n\nLemon\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nWhite Sturgeon can be found within the waters of the Frosted Heights. Get your fishing rod and get the valuable fish for your dish. They're from orange ripples in the water; I found them very quickly in my experience. Butter is an easy ingredient to find as it's sold in Chez Remy after finishing the Ratatouille realm's missions in the Castle. \n\n\nBasil, which can also be used for cooking Creamy Soup, is picked up from the ground in Peaceful Meadow. Look for its green leaves and you should find the herb fairly easily. Lastly Lemons can be grabbed from trees within the Forest of Valor and Glade of Trust.  All of these ingredients are pretty easy to get, so you should be able to gather them and cook them at any stove around your house or Chez Remy easily. You'll now have the fancy four-star dish to give, eat, or sell in Disney Dreamlight Valley.\n\n\nHow much is this dish worth?\n\n\nYou can sell the Poached Basil Butter Sturgeon for 2,284 Star Coins at Goofy's Stall and you can eat the meal for 4,961 Energy.

          "description": "Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is expected to go live soon, and we might also have some idea about when Season 1 will begin.\n\n\nLike all the recent COD titles, the upcoming shooter's live content will be divided into seasons. The start of the first season also marks the integration of Warzone into the new title, so the date is of prime importance. So far, Activision has remained tight-lipped about when the new season will go live. Thankfully, an ongoing promotion by Little Caesars has hinted at when we could enjoy the first seasonal content.\n\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops Season 1 expected release date\n\n\nThe only confirmed date we have so far is related to the official launch of the game, which is on October 25. Currently, Little Caesars is having a cross-brand promotion with Activision ahead of Black Ops 6's launch, and you can win some really interesting rewards.\n\n\nAs per the information tweeted by CharlieIntel, Activision is planning to launch Season 1 on November 14. If the final date remains unchanged, it will take three weeks for the game to get its first pieces of seasonal content. Till that happens, the Warzone content integration won't take place either, which means that you'll have to be satisfied with Zombies, Campaign, and Multiplayer modes.\n\n\n\n\nOnce Season 1 goes live, you'll be able to access the Battle Pass as well. It will be exciting to find out the exact content which will be part of the pass. As usual, there will be more rewards on the Premium version, which can be unlocked with tokens/Vault Edition upgrade.\n\n\nDo note that Activision could change the release date of Season 1, so take the information with a grain of salt. For now, make sure to pre-load the system files on your preferred platform ahead of the global launch on October 25.\n\nThe post When will Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 1 start? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Toji, or Tuji if you prefer the copyright-safe name, just got added to Anime Vanguards with Update 1, and you're surely wondering how to get him and his evolution. Well, it can be done relatively quickly, depending on whether you already have a JJK unit you're willing to sacrifice. For more details, scroll down.\n\n\nHow to Get Toji in Anime Vanguards\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nTo get Toji in Anime Vanguards, you'll first have to clear Act 6 of the Shibuya Station Story stage, which drops a special item called the Cursed Worm. After that, you'll have to complete three challanges in order:\n\n\n\nChallenge 1:\n\nKill Dogon — Shibuya Station Story stage Act 1, Shibuya Station Infinite\n\n\nKill Transfigured Mahato — Shibuya Station Story stage Act 6, Shibuya Station Infinite\n\n\nKill Sukono — Shibuya Aftermath Legend stage Act 2, Shibuya Station Infinite\n\n\nKill Jag-o — Shibuya Aftermath Legend stage Act 1\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2:\n\nSacrifice an evolved update unit — Click on Cursed Worm in inventory and then Sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 3:\n\nKill Reanimated Tuji in Shibuya Station Story stage Act 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you finish the Act 2 stage, you'll gain Tuji as a reward. There is a small chance that it will be shiny, which gives it a slightly cooler cosmetic. There was a way to get multiple Tujis, but it has been patched.\n\n\nHow to Evolve Toji in Anime Vanguards\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nToji is one of the easiest units to evolve in AV, as you won't have to farm random evo materials but instead just get 5,000 kills with him. You can do this quickly by spamming Paragon stages with Thrice mods. After that, visit the Evolution NPC and complete the evolution.\n\n\nThat does it for our guide on how to get and evolve Toji (Tuji) in Anime Vanguards.

In EA FC 24, it featured special cards for footballers who excelled in the early season performances for their respective clubs. So far, we have no official information regarding the release date or the cards that will be present in it. That said, here are all the available rumors.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Trailblazers promo expected release date\n\n\nLast year, the Trailblazers promo was released right after the RTTK promo. This year, the RTTK campaign was succeeded by the Total Rush cards. Rumors suggest that the Trailblazers promo will be released once the Total Rush campaign is over. If EA Sports follows the expected calendar, the Trailblazers promo will go live on Friday, October 25.\n\n\nThere's also a possibility that the Trailblazers promo could be two weeks long like RTTK and Total Rush. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen, but for the time being, I am expecting the upcoming promo to have two separate releases. If that happens, the second team will be expected to release on November 1.\n\n\nEA Sports usually confirms the release date of a promo 24-48 hours before it goes live in Ultimate Team.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Trailblazers player leaks\n\n\nAs of this writing, no fresh player leaks related to the Traiblazers promo have occurred yet. However, we will update the names once there are leaks close to the promo's release.\n\n\nHere are a few footballers I expect to see in the upcoming promo (these are not leaks, but my predictions).\n\n\n\nViktor Gyokeres\n\n\nCaroline Hansen\n\n\nCole Palmer\n\n\nLamine Yamal\n\n\nBradley Barcola\n\n\n\nIt will be interesting to learn all the special cards that could be included in the upcoming promo.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Trailblazers promo – Player leaks, expected release date, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It’s been a long time coming, but Dotemu has confirmed that Metal Slug Tactics will launch on November 5, 2024 on PC, Switch, PS4/5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\nNot only that, they’ve also revealed that three Ikari Warriors characters are being added to the mix, including Clark Still, Ralph Jones, and Leona Heidern. The likelihood that any of them will land on my team is essentially nil unless I’m forced to for some reason. It’s not that I don’t like Ikari Warriors. It’s that I love Metal Slug. Though, all three characters have appeared in Metal Slug games. If you’re wondering about Leona, she was DLC for Metal Slug XX.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been a bit of a protracted wait for Metal Slug Tactics. It was first announced at the 2021 Summer Games Fest. Development was quiet for a long time as the developer was working on multiple projects. Back in June, a demo of it was released, and I enjoyed it. It took a while, but it eventually clicked with me. The Metal Slug dressing feels more cosmetic, as the tactical gameplay is a pretty far cry from the typical run-and-gun format. However, as a simple turn-based tactical strategy game, I think it works pretty well.\n\n\nIt does have a strong roguelite feel to it. You make runs through regions to take on bosses, and gain permanent upgrades. The good news is that this makes the game more skill-based, and you can’t just level up your units. The bad news is that it has roguelite elements. I don’t personally hate that progression style, but it does give me a bit of pause.\n\n\nTruthfully, I’d play just about anything with Fio in it, so I’m already on board, though this month has been very busy, and the beginning of next month is looking as though it will be the same. I’ll probably get to it eventually, even if it’s not right away.\n\n\nMetal Slug Tactics launches on November 5, 2024. It will be released on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. There will be a physical edition coming later on.\n\nThe post Pull up a rocket lounger, Metal Slug Tactics is out next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One Piece's official accounts recently announced the anime's six-month hiatus. However, fans of the series will not be left unattended. A special episode called One Piece Fan Letter and One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga will take the anime's time slot. The former has already been released, while the latter is set to air the week after.\n\n\nUnfortunately, official One Piece channels just announced that the remaster will be postponed to make way for Major League Baseball (MLB) World Series' live broadcast. One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga was originally set to release on October 27. The first episode's release date has now changed to November 3.\n\n\n\n\nThe remaster will revamp the Straw Hat Pirates' adventure on the kingdom under the sea. It will not only improve upon the shading, animation, and special effects, but also compress the original 58 episodes into 21 episodes. Doing so will likely improve the anime's pacing, which One Piece is notoriously known for. Furthermore, the saga will feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack, offering a contemporary retelling of the Straw Hats’ underwater journey.\n\n\nA complete recap of the Fish-Man Island Arc's most notable moments can be found here. But to put it briefly, the Fish-Man Island Arc will see the Straw Hat Pirates return after their two-year training. Stronger and more skilled than ever, the crew is finally ready to take on the New World. However, their first challenge lies beneath the ocean in the mysterious and politically fraught Fish-Man Island.\n\n\nOne Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga will be available for streaming via Crunchyroll. Other seasons of One Piece can also be streamed through Crunchyroll and Netflix. However, availability may vary depending on region.\n\nThe post One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga postponed to November 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)",
