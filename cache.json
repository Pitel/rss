Zelda is finally the main playable character in a mainline Zelda title, for instance. But, for the first time ever in the series, one amusing detail about our usual main character, Link, has been given a little bit of an explanation.\nDespite only being a playable character briefly in the opening of the game, Link can't actually speak in Echoes of Wisdom. He makes his usual grunts and noises as he does in other Zelda games, which on the surface is totally normal — except he doesn't speak at all.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.\nThat is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.\nRead more",

          "description": "For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant. \nRead more",

Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums.

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole.

Then you'll perhaps be happy to learn about the surfacing of a new deleted scene featuring B-15 and Paradox prior to the release of Deadpool and Wolverine on Disney +.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scene shows a conversation at the Time Variance Authority's headquarters between B-15 and Paradox, who she warns not to do anything, as his job is to do nothing and prevent others from doing anything. The problem is, Paradox is a bit bored of his job and he has, in fact, already done quite some things that he shouldn't have. One such thing, namely, was setting all the events of Deadpool and Wolverine in motion.\n\n\nMatthew Macfadyen isn't present in Loki, as Paradox was only added to Deadpool and Wolverine likely due to Macfadyen's great turn as Tom Wambsgans in HBO's Succession. The scene does seem to feature a bit of a Succession taste to it, as Macfadyen spills a bit of acidic humor towards his overseer in the TVA (Tive Variance Authority).\n\n\nWunmi Mosaku' B-15, Paradox's superior, is largely absent from Deadpool and Wolverine's original cut, a stark contrast to her constant presence in Marvel's Loki. This scene was likely removed because it didn't really add much to the plot, and also to make her reveal at the end of the movie stand out as one of those surprise appearances that Marvel likes to have fans clapping about.\n\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine will come out on Disney+ Tomorrow, October 1, and will hit 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on October 22.\n\nThe post A deleted scene from Deadpool and Wolverine has finally been revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Generally, the strategy has always been to target its big, obvious eyeball, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom gets a smidge more complicated.\n\n\nI say “smidge” because the strategy of shooting it in the eyeball is still there. In fact, the quickest way to render the boss vulnerable is to watch for it to open its peeper and put an arrow in there. This only happens while it’s on the wall, and often is just before and after it fires a pretty brutal laser. However, if you manage to land an arrow while its eye is open, it will fall to the ground and be vulnerable to direct attack.\n\n\nBacking up here, right after the battle starts, I suggest getting out an electric monster.

Sabotage Studio has set the free Dawn of Equinox update for a November 12, 2024 launch, introducing local co-op and more on all platforms.\n\n\nSabotage detailed the hefty update in a press release, which calls this the studio's \"fully realized vision\" for the acclaimed RPG. The local co-op, for starters, lets up to three players tackle the adventure in its entirety, mastering timed hits in a co-op environment along the way. \n\n\nCombat has been refined significantly along with this addition. Combo Points are now retained after battles, there have been balance updates, and Mystery Locks introduce new ways to break enemy spells. If this makes things too easy or too hard for you — or anywhere in between — new difficult presets are available at the start of a new game. \n\n\nNew horizons\n\n\nScreenshot via Sabotage Studio\n\n\nBeyond quality-of-life improvements and a Quebecois localization, there are a few other major beats worth mentioning. Dawn of Equinox adds a revamped prologue that nixes the flashback structure and directly implements combat for the younger heroes. There's also a brand new cinematic during a pivotal moment for some extra impact. \n\n\nNeed help finding some of those pesky collectibles and hidden challenges? There's an improved Parrot Relic for that. Finally, a new Speedrunner Mode Relic triggers features that make it easier to keep track of your personal quest to set a world record in Sea of Stars, or at least best your own time. \n\n\nBeyond all that, the free Throes of the Watchmaker DLC is due out in spring 2025.

Having good cards as part of SBCs is beneficial as you won't have to rely on your luck.\n\n\nAs always, all RTTK Team 2 items will be able to get up to three levels of upgrades based on how these cards and their respective clubs do in the European club competitions.\n\nThe post All EA FC 25 RTTK Team 2 player leaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Deadlock, Valve's newest MOBA-shooter hybrid, is still in its embryonic stage but already getting pestered by cheaters. They seem to be drawn to Valve's games like moths to a flame, but Valve was pretty quick in its response this time around and came up with a hilarious countermeasure. \n\n\nDeadlock's new anti-cheat update has players voting to decide the fate of people it catches cheating. You now have the power to choose whether cheaters will get immediately banned, or turned into frogs for the remainder of the match, then banned. In either case, a game affected by a cheater will not count towards your MMR.\n\n\nImage by Valve\n\n\nThat's the image posted on Valve's forums to accompany the patch notes, but it's actually what you'll see if the anti-cheat system catches a cheater in your game.\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is what you'll see if the players decide to go the humiliation route:\n\n\n\n\nThe Twitter user above is obviously joking, but your average cheater's lack of knowledge of the game they're ruining might very well prompt them to similar responses. \n\n\nAnd this is one hell of a lot of fun, so here's hoping cheaters won't find a way to game the system and have non-cheaters banned. Yes, similar things have happened in Dark Souls, where hackers found ways to kill and have innocents banned in their place.\n\n\nInterestingly, this countermeasure was not inspired by the frog curse from FFVII., but by \"FU Surprise Mode\", an old Counter-Strike anti-cheat magic that never saw the light of day.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now play judge, jury, and executioner on Deadlock via Steam.\n\nThe post Deadlock’s new anti-cheat turns cheaters into frogs appeared first on Destructoid.",
