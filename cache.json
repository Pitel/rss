Excitment reached fever pitch (just check out the comments section of any Mario Kart Tour related content if you don't believe us!), so naturally, expectations for the latest batch of courses are exceedingly high. Was it all worth it, though? Let's find out.\nWith the addition of Wave 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has now gained a total of sixteen new tracks so far in 2022. Just let that sink in for a moment: sixteen new tracks. It's a five-year-old game, for goodness sake. Eight, if you count the original Wii U release! We've tried to keep this figure in mind when playing through these new courses and really look at the bigger picture here, because the new tracks on offer in the Turnip Cup and the Propeller Cup are a mixed bag, to say the least.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as \"The Laughing Deer Show\". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.\nIn fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question \"what games would you play for the first time again?\" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory?

That means it's a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we've ever seen it. \nRight now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you're not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it's one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me. \nRead more",

I'm playing Aran's Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It's a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.\nRead more",

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love? \nRead more",

I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.\nIt's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.\nRead more",

It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.\nRead more",

Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised.

Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.\r\n\nIt's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Tencent reportedly opening wallet for majority shares\nTencent is reportedly interested in becoming a majority stakeholder for developer/publisher Ubisoft. According to a new report from news outlet Reuters, the holding company, already a minority stakeholder, is considering making a significant investment in the Assassin's Creed/Far Cry developer in the near future.\nCiting multiple sources \"with direct knowledge of the matter\", Reuters claims that Tencent has expressed a desire to become the key shareholder for Ubisoft, and is allegedly willing to pay an astounding premium of over $100 USD per share in order to make it happen — more than twice the share's current value. Reuters report, unsurprisingly, caused a rise in Ubisoft stock Wednesday, with a 15% rise in value increasing Ubisoft share prices from $43.03 to around $48.33 .\nThere have been many whispers of a possible Ubisoft sale for some time now, with rumors that the Guillemot family — some of whom are the company's initial founders — might have been looking to purchase the company outright themselves. Should Tencent choose to put its money where its mouth is, however, it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able or willing to match its proposal of an approximate 130% share price. And perhaps the holding company is willing to offer such a premium for that very reason.\nTencent, of course, already has minority and majority stakes in numerous major players within the gaming industry. As well as owning several internal development studios, Tencent holds varying stakes in companies such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, and Funcom.\nThe post Rumor: Tencent looking to become majority stakeholder in Ubisoft appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Announced at BitSummit\nInti Creates is at it again, continuing to corner the 2D market with the new action platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game is actually being shown this weekend at BitSummit in Kyoto, Japan, on August 6 and 7.\nGrim Guardians will feature two playable characters (who are sisters) in the form of demon hunters trying to rescue their school from peril: Shinobu Kamizono (ranged attacker) and Maya Kamizono (melee). Inti Creates says \"swapping characters is key to gameplay,\" and in addition to solo play, there's also a two-player co-op mode. As our own CJ Andriessen points out, those two names are from Gal Gun: Double Peace.\nAmazingly, Inti Creates is calling this \"the beginning of a brand new series of 2D action games,\" hence the obvious subtitle. Whereas Azure Striker Gunvolt is their own take on the Mega Man franchise, so too will Grim Guardians mirror aspects of Castlevania (like their Bloodstained tie-in projects). Hey, if Konami isn't going to do it, someone else should!\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge release date and platform info\nAs for a release date and platforms, the former is listed as \"TBD,\" but the latter includes PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The official website will likely be the first place we'll get that info.\nJust as I said in my recent Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 review, I'm game for basically anything Inti Creates that even looks remotely like Grim Guardians.

          "description": "A new GDK update could see some graphical improvements for the Series S\nA recent update to Microsoft's Game Development Kit is adding a little extra bump in memory for the Xbox Series S. Memory allocation in a GDK update will potentially allow graphical improvements for Xbox Series S games.\nIn the June GDK, an unlisted video as spotted by The Verge popped up today, detailing improvements to the developer toolkit. One part  notes that more memory is now available for games.\n\"Hundreds of megabytes\" have been freed up, according to the video. This should give developers more control over memory, and could improve graphical performance in memory-constrained situations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6ZLGwkClM\nAs Ars Technica details, this hasn't been publicly detailed yet. But this could see developers get a little extra memory to work with on the Xbox Series S side of Microsoft's current-gen hardware.\nMore memory for the box\nThis seems like good news for Xbox Series S fans who want a little graphical \"oomph\" on their games. The Xbox Series S is the cheaper of Microsoft's two current-gen offerings, and has proven to be popular.\nThe relatively cheaper and smaller machine has been a nice surprise for players. It's especially nice for those who aren't necessarily chasing 4K resolution graphics. But as Digital Foundry notes in its Xbox Series S write-up, differences can appear game-to-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94O6o6yOGgA\nHopefully, freeing up this extra memory will help out the Series S versions and deal with some troubles around optimizing for the system. While hundreds of megabytes isn't a sudden multi-GB swing in horsepower, it could be a little uptick that could do a lot.\nThe GDK update also notes other changes as well, like addressing an issue with graphics virtual addresses. We'll see how this GDK update ultimately pans out for Xbox Series S users in the games to come.\nThe post Xbox dev tools update gives developers more memory for Series S appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Did everyone see that? Because I will not be doing it again\nOne of the most fun (and frustrating) ways to play an old favorite is trying to complete a self-imposed challenge that really ratchets up the difficulty. For me, it was beating a run in Hades on 32 heat — for others, it might be completing a Dark Souls run without taking damage or doing a Nuzlocke of a favorite Pokémon game. When you love a game enough to put the hours in that you need to complete a challenge like this, you'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish — and by how triumphant it feels when you finally beat it. I imagine that streamer Jervalin is riding even higher after winning a $20,000 cash prize for beating a near-impossible challenge in Halo 2.\nThe challenge?

          "description": "It's to establish a new identity, and also a bit easier to say\nKoch Media, a games publisher under the grand umbrella of the Embracer Group, is changing up its name. The publisher formerly known as Koch is now Plaion, as the 28-year-old company is rebranding.\nUnder the moniker of Koch Media, the company operated publishing labels like Deep Silver and Prime Matter. It's part of various games and brands, ranging from Homefront and Metro to Saints Row and Dead Island. The company was purchased by Embracer Group (THQ Nordic at the time) in 2018. Now, it will operate under a new name.\nIn a press release, Plaion says this new name will better represent the company's history and the groups it works with.\n\"Our new name offers us the opportunity to build on our rich history as a publishing partner and our outstanding, constantly growing network of world-class development studios and creative people, to keep delivering premium service to our partners, to highlight our ambition as a global player within the entertainment industry but also to reinvent ourselves,\" said Plaion managing director Klemens Kundratitz. \"Our vision is to enable and inspire our worldwide teams and partners, unlocking their full potential.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgjzDJA1o1E\nWhat's in a name?\nSpeaking to GamesIndustry.biz about the name change, Kundratitz also expresses hope that the name change will make more of an international impact.\n\"Our name for so many years was associated with physical distribution, perhaps with us being more of a central European company–although including the UK because that was among the first three countries where we launched,\" Kundratitz told GIbiz. \"But we're perhaps not seen as a global company. And it's sometimes difficult for some people to pronounce.\"\nFor the record, Plaion is easy to pronounce. It's just play-on. The company's new logo is also stylized around the common triangle used for Play.\nThe post Publisher Koch Media rebrands to become Plaion appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, in the final stretch of Coconut Mall, the Shy Guys don't just sit there in their cars.\nThe developers shared a short clip of the new Shy Guy antics.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1555191948956368897\nGranted, in the original Mario Kart Wii version of Coconut Mall, the obstacles were deadlier — the cars drove back and forth and were harder to avoid. That isn't the case here.\nThis Coconut Mall fix is more of a middle ground for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players.\nThe Shy Guys are less static than before (excluding the Time Trial mode, as pictured above), but they aren't too annoying, either. Before, they felt lifeless in a kind of jarring way, and people definitely noticed that something felt off near the finish line. So it's good to see Nintendo go back and improve things, even if it's a small detail in the grand scheme.\nAfter you're done playing the Turnip and Propellor Cups in Wave 2 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, maybe circle back for a match on Coconut Mall. I'm excited to hop online tonight, especially for the all-new track, Sky-High Sundae.\nAt this point, kind of against all odds, I feel like I've gotten good mileage out of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass.\nThe post Mario Kart 8 Deluxe updated Coconut Mall so the Shy Guys don’t sit still appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hardly out-of-pocket, in all sense of the term\nMobile gaming, which has continued to grow from strength to strength on a yearly basis, saw its first decline in revenue for some time in the first half of 2022. The slump in overall sales and in-game transactions hit most genres, though many of the most popular titles continue to hold steady.\nThe new data, published by the industry analysts over at Sensor Tower, shows that only the \"Arcade\" genre saw any significant growth, with a raise of around 14% year-on-year, which equates to somewhere in the region of $176 million USD. Almost all other genres — from racing games to puzzlers, RPGs to shooters, and even the cash cow of casino games — all saw a hefty decline in sales figures.\n\nOverall, the U.S. mobile gaming market was down by almost 10% over the previous year. This won't find the industry on the ropes just yet, however, as it still raked in somewhere in the region of $11.4 billion. Astounding. The decline in mobile gaming revenue has been equated to both the increased cost of living, economical issues, and the softening of COVID-19 restrictions, which has seen more people out and about, rather than sitting at home idly on their phones.\nMobile gaming is just one of a number of industry sectors that have reported a revenue decline in 2022. Publishers such as PlayStation, Activision Blizzard, and Nintendo have all seen either hardware, software, or operating income fall when compared to the same period the previous year. While none of these slumps are big enough to cause any sweats, it is clear that the gaming industry as a whole is entering something of a down period, one very likely to continue as 2022 progresses.\nThe post Mobile gaming saw a decline in revenue during the first half of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the studio has made an official reveal for Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2, it remained shy about delivering any information whatsoever pertaining to the release.\nThe original Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection launched on PC and Nintendo Switch in March of 2021 and is packed out with 10 hit games for SNK's awesome, but ultimately unsuccessful, handheld console. The original release featured hits such as Samurai Shodown! 2, SNK Gals Fighters, Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999, Big Tournament Golf, and The King of Fighters R-2, but did not contain independent re-releases such as SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, or the brilliant Match of the Millennium. (Note: MotM was only excluded from the Steam edition.)\nWhile SNK has not announced platforms, a release date, nor a game listing for the second selection, one would assume it would compile the aforementioned omissions and — if we're extremely lucky — the NGPC ports of Bandai Namco's Pac-Man and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. According to SNK, more details are set to follow soon.

New enemies threaten to cause a bunch of problems for the Cleaner crew.\nBut the survivors will have some back-up, too. A new playable Cleaner, \"Prophet\" Dan, is also joining the action. A previous preacher of the end times, he'll probably make for a wacky addition to the roster of playable characters.\n\nThe expansion will also include some new weapons, cards, and skins. Anyone who picked up the Back 4 Blood Annual Pass, or the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition, gets Children of the Worm as part of that. Otherwise, Children of the Worm will be available as a standalone purchase.\nThe ongoing apocalypse\nThis new entry marks Back 4 Blood's second expansion, following after the Tunnels of Terror DLC expansion that went live in April. The Tunnels added some new Cleaners and special variations of the Ridden to deal with, alongside the Ridden Hives.\nWith an Act 5 on the way and even more stuff to do, it's nice to see that Back 4 Blood seems to be getting a steady cadence of post-launch support. It was a pretty good time for co-op at launch, and I really grew to like the card system that Turtle Rock created for this new variation on the co-op PvE survival game. Even if it hit some stumbles out of the gate, Back 4 Blood has kept on rolling on.\nAnd if you like Turtle Rock's particular brand of PvE, well, it's a good time. Not only is Back 4 Blood getting some more content, but apparently the servers for Evolve have popped on and players have been dipping a toe back in.\nAs for the Children of the Worm, the new DLC expansion arrives on August 30 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Back 4 Blood gets its next expansion, Children of the Worm, at the end of August appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Wii U YouTube app now has an end-of-life date, and so do two other services on the console.\nAs pointed out by Nintendo Everything, the YouTube support page for the Wii U was recently updated, stating: \"Note: The YouTube app is no longer available for new downloads from the Wii U eShop due to Nintendo’s upcoming discontinuation. Starting in October, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Wii U devices. Viewers can still enjoy YouTube on Nintendo Switch devices.\" Although the 3DS and Wii U shutdown is March 27, 2023, a few companies are getting things started a little earlier (to prepare for the other phase of the shutdown, where on August 29, 2022, you can't use Nintendo eShop card funds on both marketplaces).\nCrunchyroll is doing the same thing, as this Twitter user has revealed: they sent out an email to Wii U users that service was ending on August 29, 2022. Finally, Niconico has a page up similar to Google, which talks about the end of service, mostly for the 3DS app, which has been in operation since 2014.\nIt all makes sense, it's just rare to be able to talk about the two systems these days: so I'm going to take every opportunity. Also, the below \"we're sad to see you go\" image from Niconico is great.

It’s not a sequel, but the aesthetics, the characters, and even the UI call back to their first title. It reminds me of Maxis in the ‘90s before and directly after EA got their evil all over them. A lot of the games sprung up around SimCity, and while not all of them were as directly related as the ones from Two Point Studios, some were tied together, even if it was just in a reference.\nI’ve been eagerly waiting for the next step in the Two Point experience. Actually, I’ve been waiting for the next few steps.…",

The developer announced that delay earlier today on social media, with a rescheduled date to be announced.\n\"A big thank you to everyone playing MultiVersus. It’s exciting to see so many players enjoying the game and the launch of the Open Beta is just the beginning,\" said the team on Twitter. \"We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players.\"\n\"We’ll let you know the timing as soon as we can. We appreciate your patience & enthusiasm and look forward to unveiling Season 1 very soon!\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvborgKG7fw\nMultiVersus, which entered open beta just last week, has already had a very impressive opening, with the PC version logging an amazing peak of 144,000 players during its opening weekend. The free-to-play fighter quickly became the fourth most popular title on Steam, with the impressive figures not even taking into account additional player numbers for the PlayStation and Xbox editions of the beta.\nAs MultiVersus is still in its playtest stages, Player First Games is using this time to gather various feedback about the title, from its online connectivity and crossplay function, to in-game balance and various bugs that may need ironing out (and I ain't just talking Bunny). If you want to check out the action for yourself, then all you need do is download the game client on the platform of your choice, and you're ready to rock.\nMultiVersus is in open beta now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post MultiVersus season one has been delayed, new date forthcoming appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has dated them for September 9\nIt's not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!\nAs a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they've been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists \"December 31, 2022\" as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a \"global release date\" system, it's typically close enough barring regional delays.\nProduction on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it'll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what's left, we don't know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.\nAs always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that's been updated since 2015.\n[Update: At the time of this update, Best Buy has the 2-pack in stock. This 2-pack format seems to be the way they're being distributed all over the world, and is consistent with 2021 pre-orders.]\nThe post Both the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo will be out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "FIFA's final days keep EA in the premiership\nIt's the turn of long-time developer/publisher Electronic Arts to share its results from the most recent quarter of the 2023 financial year. And while many publishers are showing a slump in overall revenue, EA seems to be relatively healthy, powered by its ongoing dominance over the sporting game industry.\nOverall revenue for EA is up 14% year-on-year, which translates to a meaty $1.77 billion USD. Net income is also up — offering a huge 52% rise which equates to $311 million. It will probably come as zero surprise that the FIFA franchise is still one of the aces in EA's portfolio, with FIFA Mobile and microtransactions service FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow in both revenue and users. FUT has, notably, seen its user base rise by 40% in the past 12 months.\nIt also seems that EA's purchase of Codemasters was a very savvy decision, as the UK developer's F1 22 has actually outperformed on the publisher's expectations. Codemasters was, of course, purchased by EA for $1.2 billion back in early 2021. EA was hoping that the acquisition would give it a dominant stake in the racing game market, and it seems that the British studio is already delivering on those hopes.\nThis year's FIFA entry, FIFA 23, will be the final football sim released with the official FIFA branding. While EA has a huge task ahead in rebranding one of the biggest and most profitable gaming franchises on the planet, the community knows where its dedication lies, and it seems hugely unlikely that the loss of the FIFA brand will harm EA's bottom line in the bigger picture.\nThe post EA delivers solid quarter revenue results, driven by F1 and FIFA Ultimate Team appeared first on Destructoid.",

But a new report claims a potential Warcraft mobile game has fallen through.\nBloomberg reports that a World of Warcraft mobile game has been shuttered. The project was in development for three years, but according to Bloomberg's sources, the two companies disagreed over financial terms and ultimately called it off.\nThe team of over 100 developers has allegedly been disbanded. Some were reportedly offered internal transfers. A spokesperson for NetEase declined to comment on the matter to Bloomberg.

The report says it wouldn't be a direct one-to-one of the mega-hit WoW, but a spinoff set during a different time period.\nNetEase and Blizzard have collaborated on several major projects, so the report comes as a bit of a surprise. Alongside Diablo Immortal, which has received some frustrated reactions from fans, NetEase also publishes World of Warcraft and other Blizzard franchises in China.\nThough fans haven't been wild about the microtransactions, Diablo Immortal has continued to see growth, and World of Warcraft is building up to the launch of its next expansion Dragonflight.\nWhether this is a stumbling block or not, it looks like mobile Warcraft plans are on hold for now.

The Switch already surpassed the Wii in total hardware sales (which is at 101.63 million), and it's about to beat it software-wise, too. (The Wii has 921.85 million units sold in that arena.)

The Switch is well on its way to crack the PS4's 117.2 million mark, then it's coming for the Game Boy next (which has 118.69 million units sold).

          "description": "PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.\nFollowing in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. \nSince the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: \nGet ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!\nhttps://t.co/kbnwKv1n5m pic.twitter.com/NoVvqUzSTp\nAugust 4, 2022\nAs you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us. \nWhat do you think of the visual upgrades in The Last of Us Part 1?

The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today's news seems to reaffirm that release window. \nWe've enjoyed Ooblets whenever we've checked in on it over the years, so it's exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.",

The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. \nThe game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. \n\n\nDespite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled.

If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.\nThe finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.\nFinally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. \nSince the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.",

It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. \nHere are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: \nMario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million \nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million\nSuper Smash Bros.

According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well.

          "description": "Amazon's cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.\nThe hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.\nAmazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. \nThrough the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company's new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.",

While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.\nWe still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word \"authenticity\" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:\nEasier Play\nMore Pro for the Pro Stick\nHang on the Rim\nShooting is a Weapon\nKilling Stalls with Adrenaline \nDefensive Play\nImproved A.I.\nBadges Sound More Confusing But Better?\nPurchase",

          "description": "Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a \"AAA game studio\" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. \nNow, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. \nHere's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp\nJuly 30, 2022\nOne more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.\n@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx\nJuly 30, 2022\nAs you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. \nThe reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, \"I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine\" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. \nWhat do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!",

Disney has delayed its release by a few weeks as it will now premiere on Sept. 21. However, on Sept. 21, three episodes will go live. \nThis news comes by way of the official trailer for Andor released today by Disney.

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. \nOne of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. \n“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” \nIf you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. \nYou’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).\nIn the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review. \nHave you ever used the PS5 Accolades feature?

Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA's snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.\nShoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉\nJuly 29, 2022\nAccording to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.\n1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯\nJuly 29, 2022\nSome NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA's involvement.\nTell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...\n@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ\nJuly 29, 2022\n89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!\n#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE\nJuly 29, 2022\nYo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!\n#RatingsAdjustor and get me right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/uHE9xnAS9X\nJuly 28, 2022\nThe hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year's ratings.

The trailer dives into the game's fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.\nSuermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.\nThe trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.\nAll of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.\nAre you still invested in Genshin Impact?

Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. \n\n\nPlayers can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. \nAccording to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.",

The title blends mech gameplay and farming with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year. \n\n\nPlayers control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trusty mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. \nWhen you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.\nBounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.",

          "description": "Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. \nThe game, which premiered during last year's Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister's wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.\n\n\nThe trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex's emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala's mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.\nThirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It's a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. \nA Steam demo goes live later today if you're still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.",
