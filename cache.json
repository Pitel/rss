Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that \"DEI\" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "\"Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great,\" Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. \"That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.\nRead more",

I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling.

It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.\r\n\nHow many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.\nThe problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case.

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.\n Read more",

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.\n Read more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

The project is called \"Artemis\" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless \"full of confidence\".\nRead more",

Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens.

          "description": "Wahoo, there will be a Mario Kart Switch 2 title that will likely re-appear during the April 2025 Nintendo Direct after the new console's teaser trailer. However, we know quite a few of the characters that will be in the game from the few seconds of footage we've seen so far. \n\n\n\n\nAll Mario Kart Switch 2 characters so far\n\n\nDespite the short clips of Mario Kart Switch 2 footage we've received so far, there are plenty of recognizable characters that can be spotted. They include the following:\n\n\n\nMario\n\n\nBowser\n\n\nYoshi\n\n\nDonkey Kong\n\n\nToad\n\n\nDaisy\n\n\nRosalina\n\n\nPeach\n\n\nLuigi\n\n\nWario\n\n\nKoopa Troopa\n\n\nWaluigi\n\n\n\nThis is hard to confirm, but it also seems like Pauline is a playable character, but it can be difficult to see. As you look at the footage as the Switch 2 flips around, you can see a brunette in a red dress. It would make sense to see the character join the race as she's featured in the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pack DLC and in the most recent Super Mario Party. Nintendo seems to be pushing her more in the universe since her glamorous role in Super Mario Odyssey's New Donk City.\n\n\nScreenshot via Nintendo UK's YouTube channel\n\n\nThe footage also points to the game featuring 24 playable racers in the same race, so Mario Kart on the Switch 2 will likely feature many more characters than this. With the inclusion of the Splatoon kids, Link from The Legend of Zelda, and Animal Crossing's Villager, among others in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it's possible we could see more Nintendo IP in the next Mario Kart title.

          "description": "Monopoly GO seasons typically last between one to three months. During them, you collect stickers to complete albums, rewarding you with dice, cosmetics, and cash for your landmark upgrades. Here's what happens to leftover stickers you have at a season's end and whether your stars carry over to the next.\n\n\nWhat happens to sticker stars when a season ends in Monopoly GO?\n\n\nWhat happens to your stars at the end of a Monopoly GO season depends on the season itself. For example, 2025's Jingle Joy album converted your stars into dice like several previous seasons. However, a few past seasons, like Monopoly Origins, have turned your stars into vaults for future albums, so it's unknown which route the Artful Tales season will go for.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFor the Jingle Joy season and album set, any leftover stars you had before it ended will convert to dice rolls automatically. Although Scopely didn't specify the exact conversion rate, it appears one star equals approximately two to three dice. Most seasons usually have a maximum conversation rate between 700 to 1,000 dice. In short, if you didn't purchase any last-minute vaults for extra stickers, you'll at least start the Artful Tales season with extra dice.\n\n\nConsidering Jingle Joy's conversion is slightly higher than in previous seasons, the rate is decent even compared to its vaults. Each vault gave a few hundred dice, but the main selling points were their sticker packs, particularly with the most expensive variant. On the flip side, you can also get extra stickers by buying vaults during any season, but this comes at the risk of not getting what you need to complete your albums. You can also give sticker stars to friends if they want to take a shot at an expensive vault for extra cards.\n\nThe post Monopoly GO: What happens to stars when a season ends? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Gameplay of the highly anticipated sequel was shown during the teaser trailer. \n\n\nNext Mario Kart 24 player multiplayer confirmed?\n\n\nYouTube analysts, such as Good Vibes Gaming, have paused the gameplay reveal of the next Mario Kart and have noticed there are 24 spaces on the starting line. 11 characters are shown in the teaser, but 13 more slots are left open, leading to speculation of a bigger number of racers per match. Some of the characters involved in this desert race include Mario, Peach, and Waluigi, among others. \n\n\nScreenshot via Nintendo UK's YouTube channel\n\n\nNintendo has announced there will be a Nintendo Direct focused on the Switch 2 on April 2. We will likely find out more about the Mario Kart sequel then. \n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 finally revealed\n\n\nWe still don't know much about the Nintendo Switch 2 but we finally received a first look at the console this week. As rumors and leaks have suggested, the Joy-con are magnetic and larger. They no longer will slide off like the original Nintendo Switch. The screen will be bigger, too, as demonstrated by the teaser trailer.\n\n\n\n\nIf you're not a fan of the next kart racer from Nintendo, you might be happy to know that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is likely backward-compatible. With some exceptions, your physical carts and digital versions of current Switch games will work on the Nintendo Switch 2. \n\n\nThis new entry in the series will be the first major sequel in over a decade, since Mario Kart 8 launched on the Wii U on May 30, 2014.

          "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 has been officially announced, and Nintendo has released the first official trailer of the new console.\n\n\nWhile the upcoming console appears similar to the first one, plenty of sweet changes will be made under the hood. So far, Nintendo hasn't announced when the exact launch will take place, but we should be able to know more come April 2's Nintendo Direct.\n\n\nIf you believe in online rumors, however, it shouldn't be long before you can pre-order your copy.\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 pre-order release date (rumored)\n\n\nAs I said earlier, neither the official release date nor the pre-order dates have been disclosed by Nintendo. According to social media rumors, someone managed to take screenshots of a deleted Discord post, which shares what could be crucial information for all potential Nintendo Switch 2 users.\n\n\nAccording to the now deleted information, the devices are ready for Pre-Orders \"Really For Soon.\" The post also disclosed that the console could cost around 399 Euros and featured a limited edition bundle. It will have 25 games ready for launch, all priced between 69 and 79 Euros. The user who had shared the information reportedly works at French retailed Micromania.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the information could be nothing but a hoax since there's no way to verify what was posted. There have been plenty of speculations over the last few months regarding the release dates and potential prices. If the rumors are true, Nintendo Switch 2 will be priced at $399, excluding VAT.\n\n\nThe rumored post didn't have any exact date of release or pre-orders, and the term \"Really For Soon\" could be open to interpretation. As you might already know, there will be a Nintendo Direct on April 2, which is more than 2 months away. Whatever the case may be, fans will have to wait patiently for at least a few more months before they can pre-order their copy of Nintendo's upcoming console.\n\nThe post When can you pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s easy to feel burned out on them.\n\n\nSo, I’ve been ignoring a lot of titles that boast the metroidvania label in their press releases. I’ve probably missed out on some good ones, but I just can’t look at another rectangle-dominated map screen. Okay, one more, I guess.

As officially revealed by Nintendo, the new console will release later this year, and we also have confirmed information about Backwards compatibility.\n\n\nThe official trailer, released by Nintendo, gave us the first glimpse at what the new console will look like. One of the very first pieces of information was on the topic of backward compatibility, and there is great news if you have owned or own games from the Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nWill Nintendo Switch 2 have Backwards Compatibility\n\n\nIf the header of this article wasn't indicative enough, then yes, you'll be able to play your older games on the new console. This includes a huge lineup of games that have been released for the Nintendo Switch since 2017. This is great news for game preservation as well, which has been an iffy area between gamers and developers. \n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Backwards Compatibility Explained\n\n\nNintendo won't be trying to implement rocket science in their new console, and Backwards Compatibility should work as expected. Put simply, Backwards Compatibility is the ability for a game released on an older console to run on a newer piece of technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to play both digital and physical versions of games originally designed and released for the original Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nThat said, certain games won't run properly on the new tech. They will either not be supported at all, or they might not be fully compatible with the Switch 2. We are yet to get any information about which games will be included on that list. Based on the confirmed list of games, there's not much that you'll be missing out on. \n\nThe post How will Nintendo Switch 2 Backwards Compatibility work appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
