We all know them, and we all either love them or hate them as they collapse under the weight of our platforming plumber Mario. These platforms have been around since Super Mario Bros. 3, always waiting to lure us in with the safety of a flat surface, before falling and taking us Mario to his demise. Presumably, because they're donuts, right? Wrong.\nLeave it to Supper Mario Broth to uncover the truth behind these devious dough-shaped platforms. It turns out that, despite looking like donuts in the 2D Mario games, that's not actually what they're based on. We've all seen these platforms utilised in New Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 3D World, and a few other 3D games, and they're not just little floating donuts, but rather a tube.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Necessary as it might have been for Bungie, this 'sunsetting' removing content people bought has raised hackles. Now Bungie say they've been working on the game's technoguts, and won't do that anymore. Expansions will stick around forever, though seasonal content will still leave at the end of each expansion cycle—and Bungie don't say anything about bringing back all the old stuff.\nRead more",

In fact I get the distinct impression it was one of the best, if not the one that most distilled the series' essence.\nThat essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic \"going on an adventure\" sense rather than the \"rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again\" genre sense.\nYou're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.\nI admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.\nRead more",

Although I spent the latter half of last week playing and performance testing it, the worst I saw in terms of bugs, glitches and unintentional chicanery was one temporarily floating pedestrian and a few de-synced execution animations. Only after I committed this clean(ish) bill of health to writing did the game’s wider playerbase discover that it is, in fact, riddled with issues: some benign and hilarious, others irritating and game-breaking. Well fine then, game.\nSome of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle. Then there’s former vid bud Colm (RPS in peace), who has found his feet pinned to a car roof before fading away like Marty McFly if his parents split up.\nRead more",

For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?\r\n\n\r\nPeople who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling (\"more spooky than outright horror,\" as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as \"Aftermath\".\nBut the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a \"Mostly Negative\" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.\nRead more",

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.\nThe upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance. \nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.\nEvil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Saints Row series started off as a sort of rival to Grand Theft Auto, an action-adventure crime sim about working your way up the ranks of a street gang to become the boss. It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.\nSaints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.\nRead more",

You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.\nIt got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.\nRead more",

Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.\nI did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.\nRead more",

We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.\nIt's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.\nRead more",

Bethesda announced during Quakecon today that Threewave Capture The Flag was now part of their enhanced Quake release, with nine maps, the grappling hook and new improvements.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. \nHappily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for. \nRead more",

It's called Videoverse, and is described as a narrative adventure above love and friendship, inspired by Nintendo's now defunct social network, Miiverse (which all Wii U and 3DS owners know is the single, most wholesome thing to have ever existed in video games). Have a watch of the teaser trailer below. \nRead more",

          "description": "Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.\nWe Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.\nRead more",

Bavíme se přitom o linuxových testech, kde podpora čipů rodin M1 a M2 je teprve vyvíjena, přičemž Apple spíše linuxové podpoře naházel klacky pod nohy, kterými se vývojáři z Asahi Linuxu už více než rok a půl postupně prokousávají.",

With access to almost infinite regions of dimension, Morty's weak teenage frame will be emboldened in battle thanks to a wide variety of reality-shifting attacks and specials, which may or may not reflect the hilarious events of the long-running animated series. Because I'm guessing, to be perfectly honest.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCMLGvlOxt0\nA Bruiser class character, Morty is a button-slapping brawler, joining MultiVersus roster of heavy-hitters including Garnet, Batman, Shaggy, and Taz. Morty's evolved appendage \"Armothy\" can be used to knock his opponents seven ways from Sunday in standard attacks, while his trademark all-purpose alien device, Plumbus, is utilized in specials. For long-distance warfare, Morty has access to snake-based projectiles, as well as a Passive which allows him to throw grenades at his enemies or plant them around the battleground for proximity damage. Just like in that famous episode maybe I don't know I'm 41.\nMorty Smith is available to purchase in-game now, priced at 3,000 Gold, 700 Gleamium, or 1 Character Ticket. Morty will be followed later in season one by additional DLC characters. These will include Morty's grandfather Rick Sanchez, DC Comics' anti-hero Black Adam, and Gremlins' malevolent Stripe.\nMultiVersus is available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Morty now in MultiVersus? Aw, geez! Great Scott! I don’t know I’ve never watched it appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will now launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms February 14, 2023.\nIt has been a hot minute since we last talked about Wanted: Dead, but for those of you yet to hear of this quirky little release, developer Soliel is creating a delightfully po-faced action title that is seemingly fully coming to terms with its own sense of dramatic and technical clunkiness. Players step into the finely-hones biceps of Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, whose black ops police unit attempt to uncover and put an end to a dangerous corporate conspiracy in a dystopian, futuristic take on the cap…",

          "description": "A fantasy open-world action game with some sleek combat\nIf you dig open-world action with a fantasy flair, Where Winds Meet might be one to watch. Developer Everstone Games unveiled its new action game Where Winds Meet today, and it's got some style.\nDetails are scarce so far about it, though we did get some look at the gameplay of Where Winds Meet today during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022. It's a third-person action game, with some gorgeous views and big open areas.\nAt first glance, it gives off the third-person action vibes of a modern Assassin's Creed or Ghost of Tsushima. There are bows, swords, counters and follow-ups.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHVTPbJVrM\nWhere Winds Meet is definitely taking a heavy dose of wuxia inspiration though. The way the protagonist leaps around in the air, or runs up the side of a ship, is pretty sick.\nAccording to IGN, Where Winds Meet is set during the Ten Kingdoms era. Different factions are vying for power, which seems like good fodder for tough choices and also plenty of battles.\nMore than just a warrior\nDeveloper Everstone Games also told IGN that the player can opt to take sides in the war, or choose to pursue other goals. You can look to be a doctor, merchant, or even just a wandering swordsman.\nDifferent fighting styles will also be incorporated, to add a little variety to fights.\n\nWe only got a small bite today, but I'm impressed by what I've seen so far of Where Winds Meet. A little more fantasy action in the third-person open-world action genre could be pretty interesting. No firm date or window has been set yet, but I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing more from this project and team in the future.\nCatch up on the rest of the Gamescom Opening Night Live announcements in our catch-all thread here.\nThe post Where Winds Meet revealed with some gorgeous-looking action appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Live or die, make your choice\nIt's been a long time since we've heard about The Outlast Trials, but Red Barrels brought a grisly new trailer to Gamescom Opening Night Live. The developers also announced a closed beta test for The Outlast Trials running from October 28 through November 1. As host Geoff Keighley put it, \"That's right, some people will get to play something this year.\"\nIf you're generally on board with Outlast (or would be down for a Saw-puzzle-trap-filled take on the series with optional multiplayer antics), you'll want to keep tabs.\nhttps://youtu.be/EVi3-VjbM1U\nThe Cold War-era premise is that Murkoff Corporation is testing new \"methods of brainwashing and mind control.\" Rest assured, they'll be taking things to their most unhinged extreme. Today's trailer was all gore and grime. I need a shower!\nViewed in slow-mo, I liked the look of traps and gadgets that players can use to turn the tide during these so-called experiments. How the format works alone and with partners, and what happens when some of you perish, remains to be seen. I get the impression that Red Barrels got out of its comfort zone, and that could lead to a fresh new type of survival-horror experience, or potential alienation. I've always wanted a gnarly Saw-like game experience, and being able to share that with like-minded horror fans sounds novel.\nMore details on the Outlast Trials beta will be announced soon, so for now, just pencil in the October 28 start date, if anything. I'll certainly be in the right mood for this game.\nThe post The Outlast Trials will have a closed beta over Halloween appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although Gamescom Opening Night Live has the potential to give off the air of \"the E3 of Europe,\" today was largely reserved for games that were already shown off in some capacity; or came back with a marketing reboot after years-earlier reveals. It's time for a Gamescom 2022 recap.\nThere was some cool stuff in there. The studio behind Moonbreaker smartly united with kinda-huge-deal author Brandon Sanderson to bring us a \"Hearthstone meets XCOM\" game; with a vibrant art style and a customizable mini painting element.

          "description": "Just another day in a zombie-infested paradise\nA long-in-development zombie game is back in action, and arriving early next year. Dead Island 2 will launch on February 3, 2023.\nDuring today's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios revealed a cinematic trailer for Dead Island 2. It features plenty of zombie-slaying action, and one of the game's playable characters, Jacob.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dv1cqr1npA\nWe also got a look at some gameplay for Dead Island 2, which features a ton of the bloody first-person action seen in the first Dead Island.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEkkrJpI6XA\nPlayers will be able to play as one of six different characters including Jacob. Each one has their own style and skills, and you can instantly re-spec if you don't like the build you're putting together.\nThe story takes place in Los Angeles, with locations around the city including Beverly Hills and Venice Beach.\nYou can play the adventure by yourself, or opt to do some co-op. Up to three players can party up and blast through hordes of zombies together.\n\nRise from the grave\nDead Island 2 has been kicking around in some form or another for quite a while. We got some indication earlier this year that a Dead Island 2 launch could be set for 2023, and it looks like that's panned out.\nWhile the news did leak a little bit ahead of schedule, it looks like the zombie-crushing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island is due back soon. The original was a goofy, decent enough zombie-smasher with some light RPG elements and good co-op fun. While the successor to the series has been mired in development for quite a few years, we'll at least finally get a chance to see what a new Dead Island looks like soon.\nDead Island 2 will launch for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Stadia on February 3, 2023.\nThe post Dead Island 2 re-emerges and sets a launch date for February 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Killing Game Show\nAs part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, publisher Nexon and developer Embark showed a blink-and-you'll-miss-it trailer for their upcoming game show shooter, The Finals.\nThe trailer offers very little in the way of context, but seemingly The Finals will focus on an ultra-violent \"game\" of survival, with players competing in a do-or-die competition to win big bucks and other prizes. Previously released footage featured rat-a-tat gunplay and bombastic explosive-based combat, with some vehicular mayhem and roof-jumping verticality thrown into the mix.\nhttps://youtu.be/Gq-R9GjW-Ik\nThe concept would suggest we might be looking at a battle royale affair, perhaps with highly customizable player characters, but we'll have to wait a little longer for Embark Studios to play its hand and offer us a little more info on The Finals and its Smash T.V.-style landscape of killing for kash.\nEmbark Studios also talked up the game's sense of destruction.\n\"A skilled contender might go in guns blazing, but with environmental destruction in your arsenal, that’s just the start of what you can wield against your foes! All of our arenas can be altered, used, or reduced to rubble — and not just by you.\"\nThe Finals is currently in development for PC.

During the Gamescom stream, Geoff brought in his \"very good friend\" Kojima, who said that while he's known for the games he makes, he was \"here today to share some other news,\" that his \"podcast program will be available exclusively on Spotify.\" Kojima will have various guests on the podcast from across various disciplines in the industry, so it looks like we're going to get a pretty in-depth look at the work of a wide variety of developers.\n\nThe podcast will be available with both Japanese and English audio, with simultaneous translation. Geoff Keighley will also be involved with a segment to give players up-to-date industry news. The first episode of the podcast will be available in only a few weeks, dropping officially on September 8. The podcast is officially titled Brain Structure, which seems pretty fitting for Kojima and his brand. Kojima is still working on games, by the way — it seems that this is just a side project.\nSo many gamers admire Kojima and all of the work he's done, so I'm betting this is going to be a huge success for Spotify.

With that in mind, here's the briefest of looks at Wyrdsong, an open-world preternatural RPG from Something Wicked Games, a team founded by Bethesda's Jeff Gardiner.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5s48vY3Du8\nCool audio design, a sinister historical backdrop, and... not much else.\n\"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages,\" according to the studio. (Ooh, they used the \"O\" word!) \"Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre.\"\nThe Wyrdsong teaser trailer led with the team's prior experience, which included games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Skyrim, Dragon Age Inquisition, and The Outer Worlds.\nFrom what we've seen today, there isn't much to show yet, so we'll have to put a pin in it. I fully expect this game to show up again at a future showcase.

          "description": "From the newly-created Ironbird Studios\nToday during the Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, Polish publisher All in Games (who you might recognize as a publisher for Ghostrunner) announced a new internal development studio: Ironbird Creations. Curiously, it was created with the intention of \"creating high-quality new action IPs,\" and there's one coming our way already in Phantom Hellcat.\nDescribed as being \"inspired by the NieR series,\" this action romp stars Jolene, a woman who breaks the seal of a cursed theater, then is tasked with saving it. Environmental mechanics are seemingly a bit part of the game, as you can destroy walls or slam people into the band pit. Jolene will also power up via theatrical masks, and there's going to be a mix of 3D and 2D perspectives to shift up the mechanics a bit.\nPhantom Hellcat's setting is probably the most intriguing bit. A castle filled with vampires, and \"plays inspired by pop culture\" sound really promising, especially in a Suda 51 type of way. While action games need a lot of love and care to really sing, I have my eye on this one. No date was given, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and it's also set for release on PS4/PS5, and Xbox One/Xbox Series X platforms.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slyg09k3PmA\nThe post Phantom Hellcat is a NieR-inspired action game involving a cursed theater appeared first on Destructoid.",

At a glance, it looks like it's a story about awakening something humanity shouldn't have.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpDzYLpYaE\nMad Head Games describes it as a \"challenging\" third-person action-adventure game on an alien planet. The protagonist, an astronaut named Kate, will have to use \"ranged weapons, devices, consumables, and melee attacks to survive.\" The developers also mentioned elemental attacks, managing stamina for dodges, and crafting \"different items and gadgets to aid you against the countless threats in this exoplanet.\"\n\"Kate is a scientist to her core, and you'll use that scientific expertise to extract information from your surroundings by scanning artifacts, materials, and creatures in order to learn about their features, properties, and weaknesses,\" according to the Serbia-based studio. \"As you explore your surroundings, you will conduct analysis and gain knowledge that will allow you to craft new gadgets, weapons, and unlock abilities in Xenobiology and Engineering trees.\"\nScars Above is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in early 2023.

As we learned today from the Gamescom stream, we're getting a Killer Klowns from Outer Space multiplayer horror game based on the horror/comedy film from 1988. The movie has had a cult following basically since it came out, and it has traumatized us with creepy clowns for decades.\nThe Killer Klowns game also has the executive director from the Friday the 13th game attached, so it appears that the horror genre makes for some of the best adaptations. The gameplay will feature a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer structure, where players must work together to defend the town of Crescent Cove from the evil alien clowns.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ_YJaniCXs\n\"It's a total bucket list item to get to work on the next chapter of such an iconic horror IP,\" said executive director Randy Greenback.\n\"When we first heard that someone wanted to make a Killer Klowns from Outer Space game, we all had the same initial reaction: finally,\" said the Chiodo Brothers, who are executive producing the project. \"But nothing could have prepared us for the experience that the Good Shepherd Entertainment and Teravision teams were creating. We are thrilled by the sheer passion these folks share for the world of Killer Klowns and the care they have invested in bringing it to life in surprising new ways.\"\nKiller Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is set to release sometime in early 2023 for Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. You can also check out the beta now, just go to the game's website for more info.\nThe post Get ready for a Killer Klowns from Outer Space multiplayer horror game appeared first on Destructoid.",

They might not make it easy, though — your people have positive and negative traits. \"Only by improving their skills and maximizing their potential will you survive.\"\nStranded: Alien Dawn will launch on PC with a Steam Early Access version in October 2022.\nHaemimont plans to take \"at least six months\" to finish building out the game before its finalized PC release, with a price increase expected when that day comes.\nThe post Stranded: Alien Dawn is a marooned sim game from the Surviving Mars team appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new title is currently in development at Deck13, and will launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hFePdmcci0\nThe narrative trailer depicts two powerful heroes, seemingly with the strength of gods, as they protect a passing caravan of travelers and merchants from attack by the claws of some terrifying creatures. The action is set against a desolate, ruined desert world, with civilization seemingly confined to what little rubble remains within the arid lands.\nThe trailer ends with some very short, but visually very impressive gameplay footage, which sees the heroes of the cinematic exploring the world in third-person. It was a very intriguing presentation, and it will be interesting to learn about the events that led to this bizarre clash of apocalypse, monsters, and magnificent superpowers.\nAccording to developer Deck13, players can \"target and gather the essence of your enemies to shape your own custom playstyle, forging a new era for humanity in a fully cooperative or solo story campaign.\"\n\nAtlas Fallen is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

I'm there. That's what I was thinking when I saw the trailer for Friends vs. Friends during the Gamescom stream today.\nWe got a first look at the game through song, which told us a bit about what to expect. From the looks of it, you'll be fighting against friends, although it's unclear whether that means your in-universe friends or real-life ones. You can play online with 1v1 or 2v2 combat, either with friends or other players online. With such a fun art style, though, I'm usually always on board for indies like this to get a look at what it's all about.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W06-Ff9r0cY\nFriends vs. Friends will be releasing on PC and consoles, and it's available to wishlist now on Steam. The game is being published by Raw Fury, who have a pretty awesome track record with indie games, so I have hope that this'll be a fun little romp.\nWe don't have any sort of release date yet, so we'll have to be patient on that front.

We've seen plenty of underwater games before, but nothing quite like this.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCN5sQHaRGg\nThere's a reason for the quiet, lonely vibe. Here's the story setup:\n\"Set in the depths of the North Sea in a techno-futuristic 1970s, professional diver Stan is struggling to overcome a life-changing loss and embrace a new future.\"\n\"The isolation of the deep sea is a fitting manifestation of his state of mind, and as Stan retreads further into his self-imposed solitude, he starts to experience strange events far beneath the waves. He will eventually have to make a difficult choice... stay lost in the depths forever, or break free to the surface and to the rest of his life.\"\nThat all matches the reveal trailer — but what about game mechanics?

Gamescom did in fact give us a Sonic Frontiers release date, and reconfirmed the November 8 timeline in the official trailer below.]\nAfter months of wondering, we might have a Sonic Frontiers release date finally — thanks to an ad from Sega, no less!\nSpotted by Twitter user Nibel, a new YouTube ad for Sonic Frontiers just went live, and was promptly taken down. At the very end of it: a release date! November 8, 2022 could be when we'll finally see what Sonic Frontiers is made of.\nThis is very likely an early trigger-pull on a Gamescom announcement. The Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony is today, and a Sonic Frontiers showing was already confirmed. It's a safe bet that we could see this same date confirmation today.\nAs for the Sonic Frontiers release date itself, it's going to be a busy month! Harvestella is due right before it, Skull and Bones is out on the same day, and God of War Ragnarok is debuting the day after. Just 10 days later, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will arrive.

It'll also be a personal story of three people. Here's the setup, which has garnered an M rating from the ESRB:\n\"Within the perpetually war-torn metropolis of Promethea, players will decide the fates of three underdogs out to make mayhem their business, with altruistic scientist Anu, her ambitious 'streetwise' brother Octavio, and the fierce, frogurt-flinging Fran.\"\n\nPre-orders will come with cosmetics for the core trio, 10,000 in-game currency (big question mark here), and an in-game FL4K collectible: that's $40 for the standard edition. For $50, you can get the deluxe edition (which is available in physical form) and grants you Tales from the Borderlands on top of the new entry.\nIt's weird seeing all these Telltale games come back, but the hope is that if they're split between multiple studios they'll fare better.

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.",

          "description": "Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.\nDeck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.",

Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games.

Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.\nRevealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.\n\n\nSega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.\nSonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” \n\n\nProtagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. \nIn the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.",

Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.\nSet one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an \"expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative.\" The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of \"devastating magic.\"\nWhile we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market.

          "description": "Based on a recent Instagram post on the official PlayStation account, we can finally pin down a launch period for the highly-anticipated PSVR2: \"Coming early 2023.\" You can see the corresponding tweet below.\nComing early 2023. #PSVR2 pic.twitter.com/R3MwWVPyNt\nAugust 22, 2022\nWhile the announcement is relatively brief, we do know PSVR2 will release with over 20 major first-party and third-party games, including new titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and ports of Resident Evil Village, No Man's Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2. Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. \nAccording to our very own Marcus Stewart, \"VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.\"\nPSVR2 drops in early 2023, with a specific date to be announced at some point in the future.",

In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nBeyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: \nMove: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. \nMove: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.\nItem: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. \nItem: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. \n\nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. \nAre you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. \nDesiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. \nSporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Plus, players can duke it out in the PvP battle arena, “Tenkaichi Budokai.” \n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Epic Games and bring this first-ever Toei Animation franchise integration to Fortnite,” Toei Animation Inc. director of global marketing, Lisa Yamatoya, writes in a press release. “Over the last 36 years, the Dragon Ball franchise has built perhaps the largest global fanbase of any anime. And this multi-generational mainstream audience makes Dragon Ball ideally suited for a collaboration with Fortnite and its worldwide community of players. We’re excited to see the response to Dragon Ball’s arrival in Fortnite.” \nEpic Games notes that, in case you missed it, there are already Dragon Ball creative islands available in the game for you to visit. There are multiple Dragon Ball Super Episode Festival islands, and from now until Sept. 17, you can board a cruise ship and watch select episodes from Dragon Ball Super on them. Both these islands and the new Dragon Ball Adventure island were created by Vysena Studios.\nWhat do you think of this Dragon Ball x Fortnite collaboration so far?

The first game dropped over a decade ago, and ever since, zombie-slaying fans have yearned for a sequel. Well, they're in luck. A Dead Island 2: Day One Edition positing was spotted on Amazon with box art, in-game photos, and a 2023 release date. The new info was taken down, but we made sure to grab the images and extra deets for you. \nAccording to the info on the Amazon page, Dead Island 2 will be available on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. However, current-gen versions of the game don't have web pages yet. The story follows an elite squad that's immune to the infection, meaning we'll be seeing 8-player co-op when the game drops. The full summary reads as follows:\nPlayers must craft zany weapons like in the first game to defeat the seemingly never-ending hordes plaguing the West Coast. Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios' gory adventure allegedly launches on February 3, 2023 (or at least that's what appeared on the listings earlier today before suddenly disappearing).

          "description": "Inkulinati is a imagiative strategy game first announced in 2020 that brings the distinct art of medieval manuscripts to life. The game unfolds within the parchment itself as players control humans, animals, and mythical creatures to battle it out in turn-based battles that are equal parts thoughtful and ridiculous. Inkulinati has looked promising every time it’s made an appearance, and we can finally see how it's shaping up thanks to an upcoming early access launch. \nThis winter, players can dive into Inkulinati on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. The game puts you in the role of Inkulinati, a being capable of using the magical Living Ink to bring illustrations to life. The irreverent battles unfold within an open book as players command units to strategically slice, bludgeon, and even fart opponents into submission to clear the way and topple the opposing Inkulinati. \n\n\nIn addition to recruiting humans, rabbits, cats, snails, and other critters, you can enlist the aid of real-life literary figures such as Dante Alighieri. Each unit sports its own unique traits with more team members unlocked by playing. Stages promote different playstyles, with some requiring a more tactical approach and others a more aggressive assault. The game features a single-player campaign, and you can challenge friends in 1-on-1 battles.\nAnd for those wondering: yes, this is a different game than Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's recently announced narrative adventure game that shares the same artistic influences.  \nInkulinati will be available first on Xbox and PC, but a Switch version is also planned with other platforms in consideration. The game will be playable at the Xbox booth during Gamescom next week.",
