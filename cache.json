With its minimal, pixel art visuals, simplistic yet effective core gameplay, and a penchant for visceral, bloody violence, Otxo shares much in common with Dennaton Games’ arcade-style hit. Where Otxo deviates, however, is in its general structure. At its core, it is a roguelike, challenging you to clear multiple floors of bad guys without dying, all the while augmenting your abilities with beverages laced with performance-boosting properties.\nBecause of this structure, Otxo is both a blessing and a curse. It doesn’t waste any time with needless exposition or pointless chit-chat; you’re here to shoot down some nasty gangsters, and the game does a pretty great job of cutting to the chase and letting you do what you came here to do. Now and then, the carnage will be broken up by short breaks at the bar, during which you can upgrade your abilities, but mostly, Otxo is about action, action, and more action.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "All driller, no filler.\nWay back in the ancient days when the Game Boy Advance was Nintendo’s main handheld, Game Freak (yes, the Pokémon people) released a creative little platformer called Drill Dozer. Placing you in the role of a slightly crazed girl who tears through stages and foes alike with a powerful drill, it quickly established itself as an all-time classic with its unique take on platforming, though it never became popular enough to justify a sequel. Now, nearly 20 years later, an indie developer named Ahr Ech decided to make Pepper Grinder, a sort of spiritual sequel. Carrying on the spirit of platformers of yesteryear while bringing in a ton of great new ideas of its own, Pepper Grinder stands as an excellent new entry in the genre and one that we’d very much suggest you consider picking up.\nThe story takes place in a world of islands where piracy runs rampant. You play as a quiet adventurer named Pepper who amasses her pile of booty not by taking it from others, but by discovering it in various ancient caches. During a storm, Pepper's ship is wrecked on the beach overrun by these goofy narwhal-like creatures called Narlings, who raid her ship while she’s passed out and steal all her treasure. When Pepper comes to, she soon discovers a mysterious drill device called Grinder, and sets out on a vengeful quest to destroy the Narlings and reclaim her riches.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It could become a yearly thing, but that'll obviously depend on how well the first showcase goes down.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to a few of the organisers, the IIIIs - as they shall now and forever be known - reflect a high level of anxiety even among more established indie teams about finding an audience, together with a feeling that they aren't being served by existing showcases like the Geoffies, with their blockbuster headliners, celebrity cameos and extended Kojima soliloquies.\r\n \nRead more",

I honestly lost track) for years, but it's now available in a bundle on Steam as part of whatever needlessly awkward thing EA are doing this month. There's suddenly an opportunity to get into why its design and atmosphere make it probably my favourite of the whole collection, and why I wish I could say that without adding that it indulges in a lot of boring early-00s racism.\nRead more",

          "description": "Pepper Grinder is one of those games that has so many great moments in it that recounting them would almost feel unfair to anyone hoping to play it. There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.\nRead more",

We at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast think this is a good thing, in broad terms, and we discuss why (but also hope Joel is allowed holidays), as well as the response the community of players has had, which is also very interesting. Plus a straw poll indicates that only one of us would enjoy be at the middle of a maelstrom of chaos and being the Helldivers GM as a job.

Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.\nRead more",

Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun.

Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.\nThis look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.\nRead more",

Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions. But nobody turned off the making robots button, which means this action RPG in a massive open-world still involves fighting rocket-launcher T-rexes. It'll shock no one that this makes for a very good video game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Following up yesterday’s news on Ghost Story Games’ upcoming Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, another interview with the Friends Per Second podcast, via SkillUp on YouTube, has shed light aplenty on the upcoming Bioshock-ian FPS game. The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.\nNot least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now. \n \nRead more",

I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to \"a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it's 1000 metres in extent\". Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?\r\n\n\r\nStill, I'm very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it's the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based \"immersive experiences\" and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it's a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it's inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet \"secret cities\" given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn't make the last bus out of town.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it's an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,\" says Levine. \r\n\n\r\nJudas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness. \r\n\n\n Read more",

Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon's Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.\nAlfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.\n \nRead more",

You do have to look for it, mind you. The game's art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.\nMain character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking \"blackpowder\" pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed \"Hosts\" that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor's spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that's the good stuff right there. Of course, it's not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it's the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it's just that they won't ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.\nBulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of 'relaxed' and 'something more'. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you're free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.\nRead more",

There is also a giant plushi frog, listed under 'Adjustments'. The patch notes say simply \"What does he want?

          "description": "It's been nearly eight years since the launch of Civilization VI, which is the longest gap between mainline Civ entries the series has seen since the first game appeared way back in 1991. It's the perfect time for a new contender to rise and claim the historical 4X throne, and indeed, many have tried, and some have even come close. Soren Johnson and the gang at Mohawk Games struck gold in Old World by zeroing in on the ancient era and opening up the personal lives of rulers and generals as fields of play. Humankind let you fuse and blend cultures over the arc of time like a world-historic Doctor Moreau.\nMillennia is perhaps the Civ-like that's clung most tightly to the genre's apron strings. It has a few new ideas that sound interesting on paper, but even as back-of-the-box features, they're clearly not meant to significantly disrupt the established order. This is a strategy game that very much wants to be like Civilization, and has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter. Unfortunately, it isn't a particularly good student.\nRead more",

Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it's also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed.

          "description": "Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn't really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.\nPassing By - A Tailwind Journey isn't aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It's the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you're meant to go when they get around to it. It's not a purely vibe-based game, but you'll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.\nRead more",

I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn't being picked up by adventurers as much as I'd like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.\nThing is, his ranking means that I'm not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves.

Well, the next Live Letter from the Producer may bring more information on April 12. \n\n\nOne thing you shouldn’t hold your breath for during LLXXX (the 30th Live Letter) is Job action trailers for either Pictomancer or Viper. While these are obviously highly anticipated for those hoping to play the Jobs in Dawntrail, Naoki Yoshida has already confirmed that these will be coming during the Media Tour in May. \n\n\nSo what can we expect?\n\n\nWell, with such a big Graphical overhaul coming to FFXIV with Dawntrail, this Live Letter is likely to focus on that, as well as other aspects that will benefit from the Graphical Update. \n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nWe’ll also likely hear more about features coming in Dawntrail, like Cosmic Exploration and possibly some new information about the now-confirmed limited job, Beastmaster. Along with this, I expect some new screenshots from Tural and information about the story we’re going to experience when Dawntrail drops. \n\n\nThere will also be a \"Realm Resplendent with Warriors of Light\" segment, during which we’ll learn some fun FFXIV statistics, apparently. \n\n\nHow to watch Final Fantasy XIV LLXXX (Live Letter 30)\n\n\nThe Live Letter will be streamed on YouTube on the Final Fantasy XIV channel. It’s happening in the middle of the day for Japanese viewers, but for those of us further afield we’ll have to get pretty tired to watch the stream live:\n\n\nFriday, April 12 at 9pm (PDT)\n\n\nSaturday, April 13 at 12am (EST)\n\n\nSaturday, April 13 at 5am (BST)\n\nThe post The next big Final Fantasy XIV Live Letter update is on April 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It allows you to power the Furnace, a construct necessary for crafting glass and metal bars. \n\n\nTo find Coal in Lightyear Frontier, you must first complete the mission 'Restore Pine Heights'. Doing so will unlock several Coal nodes in the biome, making it the best spot to farm the stuff early in your game. \n\n\nCoal can be farmed at Pine Heights in Lightyear Frontier\n\n\nCoal can be found rather early in Lightyear Frontier over at the Pine Heights biome. It's nestled snugly between both Pine Heights and The Meadow, where you first begin your adventures. Of course, you will have to clear out Pine Heights beforehand. All biomes in the game, save for The Meadow, must be cleaned of corruption before resources spawn.\n\n\nPine Heights has Noxious Weeds and Slime to wipe up, but afterward, you have full access to its resources. You will need to sleep at least once, mind. To harvest Coal, use the Saw Spike to pound it out of the ground.\n\n\nCoal Nodes can be found in the crevasse that also contains Aluminum Nodes. Check out the below map for the location of Coal in Pine Heights:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat can you make with Coal in Lightyear Frontier?\n\n\nHarvesting Coal for the first time in Lightyear Frontier awards you with many new recipes.

Following earlier console and PC releases, developer Poppy Works' side-scroller hits Nintendo's console on April 11, 2024. \n\n\nWhen Slave Zero X lands on Switch, it'll be available in standard and deluxe editions, with the latter packing a custom Switch skin, soundtracks, and a trio of comic books from Ant Williams and Andy Lanning for those who want more of that sweet Slave Zero lore. There are also physical versions on the way for Asia and Japan on April 11, followed by the United States and Europe on May 17. \n\n\nThere's a new age-gated sizzle reel for Switch right here.\n\n\nScreenshot via Ziggurat Interactive\n\n\nSlash Dance\n\n\nBeyond the Switch release, there's one last challenge for players on all platforms.

Representing SovKhan in his \"true ultimate form,\" the addition will go live as a free update on consoles and PC alongside the Switch version.\n\n\nExpanded language support is also on the way, timed nicely with the multi-platform launch in Asia and Japan. Starting on April 11, a patch will be deployed to add in support for Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Thai language options across all platforms. \n\n\nIf you don't feel like waiting until the Switch drop, Slave Zero X is currently available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and GOG.

The fantasy \"explor-action\" platformer stars Névoa, a child of fate who returns to uncover the mysteries of a fractured Earth. The game appears to be inspired by the Metroidvania subgenre, with the studio stating it features \"seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart.\" Outside of PC, Earthblade has no announced platforms. \nIn a candid blog post, Extremely OK Games’ head Maddy Thorson opens by writing,\n“I know, I know, this up…",

          "description": "In 2020, indie studio Yellow Brick Games was formed by a collection of industry veterans with experience on triple-A franchises such as Dragon Age, Assassins’ Creed, and Mass Effect. After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.\nThe studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. \n\n\nThe studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.\n\nYellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a \"people first\" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, \"deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.\"\n\"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release\"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”",

It wasn’t until 2021, however, that we got our first proper look at Stellar Blade during a PlayStation showcase, where it was shown with its former title, Project Eve.\nFor those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along.

          "description": "If you've been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it's no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.\nThirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.\nThe relevant section says, \"Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.\"\nThere's really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there's no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft's private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.\nFor more Bethesda, check out the news about The Elder Scrolls' newest spin-off,  read our Starfield review, and see which Xbox games are coming to other platforms.",

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

          "description": "Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn't officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game's opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.\n\n\nGame director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, \"This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story.\"\nStellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January's State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.\nStellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.\nWill you be checking out Stellar Blade? Let us know in the comments!",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.\nIn terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. \nBack in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game's story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. \nThe new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. \n\n\n\nAre you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC?

          "description": "Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.\nThe newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. \n\nShadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. \nShadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. \nDeveloped by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.\n\n\nStill Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. \nFor more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year.

          "description": "Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. \nAs reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. \"We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that's made to create DLCs or expansions,\" Vincke said. \"We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”\nNot only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons & Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that \"it's going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it's their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.\"\n\n\nWhile Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There's no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur's Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it's hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We'll have to wait and see. \nBaldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. \nAs for other Dungeons & Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there's a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze's in-development D&D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft's D&D survival sim. \nYou can read our review of Baldur's Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here. \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

Check out the premiere trailer below. \n\n\nTo mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we're still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.",

It also has its first trailer and a release window.\nFirst announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nMarvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. \nMarvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown.

Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. \nNaturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. \n\n\nThe presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:\nBroly (Super Saiyan Full Power)\nBurter\nDyspo\nHit\nJeice\nKakunsa\nKale (Super Saiyan Berserk)\nMaster Roshi (Max Power)\nNappa\nSuper Trunks\nToppo\n\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a \"massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,\" so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.\nThis month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.\nHere's the rest of the line-up:\nWhat's Coming To Game Pass This Month\nLightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today\nMLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today\nThe Quarry (Cloud and Console) – March 20 | Our Review\nEvil West (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 21\nTerra Invicta (Game Preview) (PC) – March 26\nDiablo IV (Console and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nOpen Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28\nArk: Survival Ascended (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X|S) – April 1\nF1 23 (Cloud) EA Play – April 2\nSuperhot: Mind Control Delete (Cloud, Console, and PC) – April 2 | Our Review\nWhat's Leaving Game Pass On March 31\nHot Wheels Unleashed (Cloud, Console, and PC) | Our Review\nInfinite Guitars (Cloud, Console, and PC) \nMLB The Show 23 (Cloud and Console) | Our Review",

The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.\nProduced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.\n\nInterestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.\nIn addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.\nWill you be checking out this crossover set?

Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.\nCreated by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  \nThe game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”\n\n\nIn a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, \n“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”\nBalatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. \nDunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. \nCheck out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world,\" Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). \"I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say.\" \nAs you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. \nAnimal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9. \nAre you going to play Animal Well in May? Let us know in the comments below!",

From a local law enforcement operation against one of the site's operators in 2009, a full trial demanding 550 million euros from four men in 2019, to their complete acquittal in 2021, the journey was eventful. Yet suddenly, following an appeal by the movie companies' anti-piracy outfit, the case will be resurrected.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
