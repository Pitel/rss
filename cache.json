We’re talking about the decision to take the grizzled hero of Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask and make him look like he had gone 12 rounds with Walt Disney.\nIn the ensuing 20 years, this so-called ‘Toon Link’ has appeared in a number of locations. From handheld series entries to Smash Bros. fighters and amiibo figures, this little guy has been there, done that and got the t-shirt (cue ‘Get Item’ sound effect); but the last time we saw him leading his own adventure was in Tri Force Heroes – securely hammering the final nail into the coffin of the cel-shaded hero.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Even with pedigree that includes the highly underappreciated Double Dragon Neon, we were shocked with just how amazing 2019’s River City Girls was, ending up as one of our favourite games in an extremely strong year. Three years later comes River City Girls 2, which continues the adventure of Misako and Kyoko in a strong follow-up that maybe treads too much familiar ground and stumbles a little, at least on Switch.\nRight away we’re treated to another gorgeous animated opening, with another cracking intro song from Megan McDuffee. One of the standouts from the 2019 original was McDuffee's fantastic soundtrack, and thankfully River City Girls 2 does not disappoint in that department. Each area of the game brings its own set of tracks, including the return of the vocal tracks themed to each boss, and even ventures into different genres with Mega Ran’s River City Girls Anthem. Luckily, if you liked the first game's tunes a lot, they play throughout this game and are unlockables that can be played in your hideout.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Triumph or Die.\nJitsu Squad is a beat 'em up heavily inspired by '90s classics like belt-scroller Final Fight and fighter Marvel vs. Capcom. You control the titular squad as they seek to stop the evil demon Origami from getting his hands on the Kusanagi Stone, a legendary MacGuffin which grants godly powers to anyone who can attain it. After a successful Kickstarter in early 2021 and a Steam release in March this year, Dutch indie team Tanuki Creative Studio’s exhilarating debut has come to Switch with an adequate conversion that could use some touching up.\nAs you boot up the game, it’s immediately apparent where the inspirations for Jitsu Squad lie. The character select screen feels ripped out of Street Fighter Alpha, it has a Saturday morning cartoon-esque art style, and references to a host of Capcom classics. The game anchors itself on nostalgia for the Marvel Vs. Capcom games, with enemies with claws running around shouting “berserker barrage” and super moves having character cut-ins with the name of said move. Even animations like Aros’ shoulder bash are almost one-to-one recreations of Hulk from MVC.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You play as heroine Sigrid – a sarcastic, cynical young adult whose temperament comes through in the talented voice over actor’s sighs and mumbles. She lives with a grandmother who won’t even let her dip her toe in the surrounding sea, because the world beyond is covered with dark perilous clouds (‘Gloom’).

          "description": "When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix's somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game's most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).\nIt's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let's get into it.\nRead more",

And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.\nI genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.\nRead more",

How about the fan-made art galleries available in-game? Well, if that’s not wacky enough, meet The Wasteland Theatre Company, a collective of players who have organised, directed and performed a series of live shows in Fallout 76. Back in April, the company produced a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in-game using a stage they built themselves. In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children's hospital.\r\n\n \nRead more",

At the time I'd been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.\nBut the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year's Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. \"Perhaps\", I thought, \"Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware's use of grey\".

It’s trains! \nJust as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around.

There are no more opinions to have about it.\r\n\r\nMy state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time.

Still, based on what we've seen in its new \"Revenge\" trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait. \nRead more",

          "description": "There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. \nHowever, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new \"Stealth Strategy\" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.\nRead more",

          "description": "The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for \"Sweet Potato\" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. \nIn a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.\nRead more",

          "description": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is easily one of the best games I've played this year. Alas, I couldn't vote for its rightful spot in the RPS Advent calendar because it's only on Nintendo Switch, and would out me as somehow who quite enjoys the way anime south Londoners replace rude words with \"sparking\" or \"snuffing\". Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.\nAnyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I've been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game's story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I'm ecstatic. In fact, I'd argue it's what makes the experience so special.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since release last Friday, The Callisto Protocol devs at Striking Distance Studio have been, I can only imagine, catastrophically hard at work on the PC build. The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.\nAnyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I'm out of town right now, so I haven't been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.\nRead more",

But earlier this year starting with Linux 5.19, kernel developers decided to \"make life miserable\" and intentionally slow down bad behaving apps that abuse split-locks. That in turn has caused problems for some games -- so far select Windows games running under Steam Play -- and thus a new kernel knob is being added to more easily adjust the behavior...",

Every online service seems to do it these days, and Nintendo's Year in 2022 for the Switch is live now to cram and condense your Switch time into raw numbers.\nAll you have to do is log into the site here with your Nintendo account, and it'll automatically grab your play stats from the whole calendar year thus far. I guess that doesn't leave much time to goose up the play hour count.\nFrom there, the site will break down your games. You'll see what your most played games were, as well as those you might have played right at launch and even a spotlight on some that have seen quite a bit of playtime.\n\nI can't say mine were too surprising; Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has absolutely eaten away the hours, I put a lot of time into the new Pokemon, and Triangle Strategy ate up some time and more with its multiple routes. I'll give a special shout-out to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, though, which remains a joy to pop into and play every so often.\nThe site also spotlights the breadth of games you've played, by days logged in and hours tallied up. It's a neat little look-back at the year.\n525,600 minutes (spent in Xenoblade)\nWhile it's nice to see what games I've sunk hours into on other platforms, there is something special to me about the Switch in-review. Other hardware are staples of my at-home life, but the Switch travels with me. I can tell when I was travelling, or when I was taking my Switch to a friend's place for Smash Bros. It's a neat little recap! And also a fun way to see what so many massive RPGs in a single year does to my free time.\nThe post The Nintendo Switch 2022 Year in Review site is live appeared first on Destructoid.",

You have been warned!]\nWe're at the stage with a lot of modern action franchises where their original leads, (and their audiences), are old enough to be parents and grandparents. Their creators are often in the same boat, leading them to think a lot about how to pass their legacies off to the next generation. That's part of why we saw Ellie take the lead from Joel in The Last of Us Part II, Indiana Jones team up with his kid Mutt in The Crystal Skull (and maybe yet another kid in the upcoming Dial of Destiny?), Rick's daughter Judith become the co-lead of The Walking Dead in its last season, Dante hand-off leading man duties to newcomer Nero in Devil May Cry V, and so on.\nT…",

          "description": "Who doesn't need a lil gator in their life?\nI don't know about you guys, but I'm always hunting for the next cozy, relaxing game I can lose myself in. Based on the news I've seen today, it seems that experience is right around the corner in the form of Lil Gator Game. Wholesome Games is one of my favorite Twitter accounts to follow seeing as they keep me up to date on all of my wholesome game needs (of which I have many), so their endorsement means a lot to me. They've been thrilled about the upcoming release of Lil Gator Game, so I am absolutely on board.\nAs you may have guessed, you play as a lil gator who is exploring a beautiful island. You'll make friends with other animals, complete little tasks like skipping rocks on the water, or shooting at little cardboard targets, and of course you can take things at your own pace to fully enjoy everything the island has to offer.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1602692402053058560\nAs much as I've love the many excellent action-centric games that have come out this year, the idea of not having any fail state or time limit sounds like a dream. The Steam page advertises that you can \"climb, swim, and glide\" your way around, and it seems to me like we're still seeing Breath of the Wild's influence on open world game design — which I will take as a win.\nLil Gator Game is the debut for indie studio MegaWobble, and if the game lives up the trailers I've seen so far, I think they're going to be in it for the long haul. Their publisher, Playtonic Friends, has also helped release indie favorites like Blossom Tales II, Demon Turf, and A Little Golf Journey.\nLil Gator Game is available December 14, 2022 on PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Wholesome Games highlight Lil Gator Game is out tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "What a load of bull\nFarmyard fighter Them's Fightin' Herds is about to welcome its first stud into the field — As revealed by developer Mane6, beefy bull boy Texas will be joining the hoof-full roster on December 19, bringing with him what is easily the biggest slab of meat yet to hit the scrapper's colorful roster.\nAs you can see in his debut trailer, Texas is, well, massive. There's some nominative determinism for you. And while most fighting games would see their larger characters only offer threat at close range, it seems that Texas is able to cause plenty of damage from mid-range, lassoing his opponents via the ropes attached to his saddle. As the father of Them's Fightin' Herds OG star, Arizona, Texas has the boisterous yee-haw! attitude, and is quite possibly someone you wouldn't want to get into a political debate with around the Holidays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLtUoTNEW8&t=32s&ab_channel=ModusGames\nSo, if you fancy grabbing this particular bull by the horns, then you'll be able to purchase Texas from December 19 at the cost of around $5. Of course, players who have picked up the Season One Pass will find him ready and raring to go in their roster come launch day. In addition to Texas himself, players will get a matching lobby avatar and a brand new stage — The Caravan Cattledome. I can't deny he looks terrifying, especially when placed alongside his diminutive opponents. But never bet against my gurl Shanty. She is the GOAT, after all.\nThem's Fightin' Herds is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Them’s Fightin’ Herds unveils its first male DLC fighter, Texas appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grab the popcorn\nSquanch Games' newest release High on Life has certainly gotten a lot of buzz this year, for better and for worse. The game has been highly anticipated by Justin Roiland fans, and has at the very least encouraged curiosity among the core gamer base. High on Life is finally out today, and there are plenty of surprises waiting ahead, including the fact that you can watch four different licensed full-length movies in the game, as well as a bunch of new shorts from Justin Roiland and pals.\nBasically, there's a TV in the living room of the player character's house, and instead of just having a blank screen sitting there, the developers decided it would be more fun to create, and license, some content that players could actually watch, if they wanted to. I will say that there is something cozy to me in hunkering down in your house to watch TV while you're supposed to be out saving the world.\nhttps://twitter.com/pearsonsmith/status/1602483788382359554\nThere are over twenty animated shorts in the game, many of which are parodies of the classic TV commercials and infomercials that we know and love. Executive producer Matty Studivan said that Roiland had been wanted to get back to the popular \"Interdimensional Cable\" bit from Rick & Morty, and that the game was a way to breathe new life into the idea.\nThe real star of the show here, though, are those four full-length movies. These include the 1994 sci-fi comedy Tammy & The T-Rex, as well as 1978 horror film Vampire Hookers, 1987 slasher Blood Harvest, and we're still waiting for confirmation on what the fourth one is. You can sit down and watch a movie when it comes on, and the movies will change depending on what part of the game you're in. The official High on Life Twitter even issued a warning to streamers because some of the movies apparently have nudity in them, so I guess there's that to look forward to.\nThe post You can watch full-length movies in High on Life appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you haven't played it, it's new to you\nOne might assume that the dawning of a new gaming generation would essentially bring an end to the flurry of remasters and remakes that we saw flood the market in the most recent decade. But of course not. Much like the film industry, the concept of taking a second pass at some beloved (and even not-so-beloved classics) is clearly here to stay — with no sign from the cash registers that it isn't still a hugely lucrative endeavor.\n2022 contained two very extreme examples of the remaster/remake concept, namely in the form of Square Enix sliding-door RPG Live a Live and Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Part I. On one hand, we had a long-lost RPG dating back to 1994 and Nintendo's Super Famicom, while on the other we had a remake of a game less than 10 years old — one that had already been remastered at that.\nIt will be interesting to see how blurry the lines become in regards to how long is \"long enough\"? And while I have zero problem with the concept of remakes and remasters per se, it's worth raising an eyebrow at the idea that each new generation of hardware immediately requires the re-establishment of the previous generation's best-selling games. Not franchises. Games. Time — and the creativity of the next wave of studios, developers, and players — will tell.\nHere are the nominees for Destructoid’s Best Remaster/Remake of 2022\nLive a Live\nMetal Max Xeno Reborn\nPac-Man World Re-Pac\nTactics Ogre: Reborn\nThe Last of Us Part I\nThe Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe\nWorld of Warcraft Classic: Wrath of the Lich King\nThe post Nominees for Destructoid’s Best Remaster/Remake of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche confirm today that these three versions are all being pushed back later into 2023.\nThe PS4 and Xbox One versions of Hogwarts Legacy will be launching on April 4, 2023. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch option will go live on July 25, 2023. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are still getting Hogwarts Legacy on its original release date of February 10.\nWhile Hogwarts Legacy is also slotted to have 72-hour early access for those who put up some extra cash for the Deluxe Edition, that will only apply to the newer versions of the game. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC purchases will be able to get the three-day early access, but PS4 and Xbox One Deluxe buyers will have their games go live on April 4, same as the Standard Edition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AZmuZNu5LA\n\"The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms,\" said the Hogwarts Legacy team in a statement on social media.\nSchool's out\nSeveral studios have been grappling with launching on multiple generations of consoles. While Marvel's Midnight Suns is live right now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the previous generation's console versions (and Switch too) have been pushed back to an indeterminate date. Gotham Knights dropped its last-gen versions, instead launching only for the newer hardware and PC.\nSeeing as Hogwarts Legacy has already encountered some delays and its Nintendo Switch version was set to move too, the launch focus now sits squarely on new consoles. It might make some folks wary of how the project will turn out, though others may be thankful that it's not the book series' author creating problems for once.\nThe post Hogwarts Legacy PS4, Xbox One, Switch versions have been delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

But before that, Harmonix is clearing the shelves of its Diamond Shop.\nHarmonix is giving away all the Diamond Shop items in Fuser, through an \"Everything Must Go\" bundle. The Diamond Shop is Fuser's extra cosmetics shop, where players could previous spend an in-game currency to pick up special aesthetic pieces.\nSince the online and store services of Fuser will be shutting down on December 19, it looks like Harmonix has decided to just let everyone grab what they want before it's gone forever.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2lE0BY26dw\nWhile the online portion of the game will be shut down, Fuser will still be playable offline. So if you want to look good while you grind the campaign or just freestyle, this is your chance to pick these up.\nThe Diamond Shop notably doesn't include DLC tracks, though.

And due to budgetary or stylistic reasons, some franchises retained the flat-planed approach to the act of kicking names and taking ass.\nAnd while Street Fighter III might not have quite been the launch success Capcom had hoped, the love for the game demonstrated by the most \"hardcore\" of the fighting game community was enough to ensure that many 2D fighters would continue to spill into the market, particularly in Japan, where the traditional look was perhaps better appreciated by digital sluggers.

There, our hero embarks upon a quest to gather up the Chaos Emeralds and restore order, while locating the whereabouts of his equally at-sea friends. As the first truly \"open-world\" Sonic title, Sonic Frontiers aims to breath new life into the dice-roll series, offering up mechanics and features that are new to the Sonic the Hedgehog universe.\nhttps://twitter.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1602468395512758274?s=20&t=HGjIckVkbEMy3ILyPxdFog\nLaunching on November 8, critics and fans have remained divisive in regard to the title, with some taking to the new direction, while others have felt that, while a gameplay overhaul was necessary, Sonic Frontiers' path isn't quite \"it\". The title also launched with various technical issues, with Sonic Team director likening the launch to a \"global playtest\". A statement that understandably raised eyebrows among some of those who had just dropped $60 on the new title. On the whole, Sonic Frontiers has been seen as a positive for the franchise, offering hope that perhaps that gen-yoo-ine top-tier Sonic title could see the light of day... someday.\nSonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers hits 2.5 million sales milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

More specifically, Microsoft would reportedly allow Sony to put Call of Duty in the PlayStation Plus subscription service for the first time.

Redemption Reapers is a tactical RPG set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch in February 2023.\nThis new RPG is being developed by Adglobe and published by Binary Haze, both of which collaborated on 2021's Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights. But rather than tackle the Metroidvania genre again, they're looking towards tactics.\nRedemption Reapers follows the Ashen Hawk Brigade as it battles against an invading legion. It looks very grim, with the hordes of monsters rampaging across the countryside.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkYM9qfdXwU\nLongtime Fire Emblem developer Masayuki Horikawa is working on the project, so it's got some of that lineage. Redemption Reapers also has a strong voice cast cued up, and a fairly different look from the usual tactics RPG.\n\"Following the success of Ender Lilies, we aimed to approach a new genre ideal for sharing our love of dark fantasy stories,\" said Binary Haze CEO Hiroyuki Kobayashi in a press release. \"Redemption Reapers’ tactical RPG combat and emotional storytelling combine for a memorable experience we cannot wait to share with the world in early 2023.\"\nSearch for redemption\nWe certainly saw a lot of tactics in 2022. Games like Tactics Ogre: Reborn, Triangle Strategy, and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope have made for a hefty backlog for most tactics fans.\nStill, there's always room for something fresh and new. Ender Lilies, from what I've seen other folks say about it, certainly seems like it did that. And Redemption Reapers could see this team-up work out for a surprise hit once again.\nIt won't be a long wait, either way. Redemption Reapers aims to charge into a stacked early 2023 season, with a February launch window in mind. We'll see how it holds up against the horde in a few months' time.\nThe post Redemption Reapers is a new tactical RPG from the Ender Lilies team appeared first on Destructoid.",

And while arguably the first year that saw its two-year-old platform, PlayStation 5, accelerate its sales past the 25 million mark, the past 12 months have still seen a wide variety of new releases squeezed onto its best-selling predecessor, PS4, hardware that simply refuses to go gently into that good night.\nEven visual stunners such as Guerrilla Games' Horizon Forbidden West and Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarok were causing the PS4's modest CPU to sweat away, ensuring that the full transition to the ninth generation remains mired in a strange limbo. It's a good situation for the players, as the PS4 has an incredible install base of over 100 million users. But, as someone who previously worked retail for many generations, I can't remember a gaming generation that took this long to become mainline.\nStill, there were some PS5-only releases, many of which boasted incredible visuals, dazzling effects, and very welcome high-speed load times. All in, it's a pretty good time to be a PlayStation owner. Many new titles are still compatible with PS4, while its bigger brother spearheads the charge into the next half-decade of gaming... Even if the physical console itself is still far, far too large for anybody's TV stand.\nHere are the nominees for Destructoid's Best PlayStation Game of 2022:\nCult of The Lamb\nElden Ring\nGod of War: Ragnarok\nHorizon Forbidden West\nSifu\nStranger in Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin\nStray\nThe post Nominees for Destructoid’s Best PlayStation Game of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Soccer hadn't seen much love in the Mario sports-sphere in some time, so it was nice to see this particular line of spin-offs get a new entry.\nWhile most of the Switch-era sports spinoffs have seen a decent number of free post-launch updates, it's sad to see this particular one come to a close. Whether this means we'll see another entry on the way soon or not isn't clear yet, but since the Switch seems to be sticking around a while, I'm hopeful we see some other sports entries revived.

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…",

When asked if there's a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. \n\n\n\"I personally can't conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,\" Kamiya told IGN Japan. \"I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.\"\nKamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks \"internally about how we could make nine of them.\" He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, \"I'm not going to do anything that will betray the players.\" \nWhile not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review. \n[Source: IGN Japan]\nDo you believe Platinum Games will make as many Bayonetta games as Kamiya would like?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?\nDid the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? \nThe table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!",

Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. \nA cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news.

Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.\n\"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,\" Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. \"Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities.\"\nYou can see the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nCrash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023.

Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.\nOutside that brief trailer, we got a release window.

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.\n\n\nUnlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.\nRocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.",

Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. \nFortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.\n\n\nHere's what he said: \n\"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.\"\nIt's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.",

Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.\nAfter its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.\nInstead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.\nBeyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.",

It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. \nTo say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:\n\"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?\"\n\n\nLevine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.\nJudas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.\nWhen Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.\nThe new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.\n\n\nAn earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6's Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.\nWe recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio's vision and our extended hands-on time with the game.

It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. \nNarratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nBayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.",

Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.\n\n\n Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three \"epic\" boss fights, and 20 outfits from \"Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.\"\nNo specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during \"Q1\" 2023.

          "description": "As a surprise ahead of The Game Awards, Vampire Survivors has been released for free on iOS and Android. Both versions are available now. You can find the iOS version here and the Android version here.\n\n\nVampire Survivors is an indie roguelike RPG where the player has to avoid hordes of monsters, undead, and (you guessed it) vampires. As you destroy enemies, you progress through a randomized skill tree to unlock new weapons and abilities. To get a better idea of the game, you can read our review, where we called it a “Single-Stick Masterpiece.”\nIn other Vampire Survivor news, earlier this week developer Poncle announced DLC called Legacy of the Moonspell. It comes with eight new survivors, thirteen new weapons, six new music tracks, new monsters, and a new stage, which they’ve called their biggest yet. It comes out soon, on December 15.",

But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.\nAfter raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this video game documentary, please consider sharing the link on your favorite social media site or share it with a friend.

New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
