The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.\nWhile Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.\nRead more",

First spotted by Japanese video game magazine Famitsu, MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura and his team posted a video of them touring Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's offices before he gets his face scanned by a wall of cameras. But before the face-scanning, they record snippets of the Yakuza: Like A Dragon lads having a heated discussion in a small apartment. Ichiban has a ponytail! Apparently, there's a new town? And I got my mum to translate some bits. Sorry mum.\nThe video in question sees Mikuru Asakura wandering about RGG's studios having a great time. First, he chats with Sega Sammy's President Haruki Satomi, who says that there's a new town in the next Yakuza game and reaffirms that they're developing a title outside of the Yakuza and Judgment series. Aside from that, it's a jovial enough chat with no more morsels of info to chase.\nAnd then Asakura is given a proper tour of the development area by RGG representative Masayoshi Yokoyama, where he marvels at the sheer number of folks working on the game and the face motion capture on some dev screens. Then onto the juicy stuff, which sees the camera pan over what looks like Yakuza 8 footage. In it, we see Ichiban Kasuga (who now sports a pony tail instead of a wild mess of hair), Yu Nanba, and Koichi Adachi from Like A Dragon having a right old natter. Asakura even asks whether it's okay to be filming these bits, but Yokoyama gives him the go-ahead.\n Read more",

Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.\nEndling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.\nRead more",

As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.\nStray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.\nRead more",

That’s why the idea of tackling the game’s die-rise-repeat formula without taking a single hit and never levelling your character’s runes is pretty dang impressive. Well, Elden Ring streamer Ainrun managed to do that, and didn’t skip the Grafted Scion boss like other streamers. Nice.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched).

You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.\nAfter a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is.

          "description": "I have long been on the \"eh, seems okay\" side of the fence regarding Valve's newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

          "description": "Making the most of Ms. Chalice\nThere are significantly harder challenges to topple in Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course than the Pawns, but for such a seemingly simple fight, I sure struggled with these leaping maniacs. Just... parry their heads 'til they fall off. How hard could it be? Well, it's a frantic scene, doubly so in co-op when you're trying to stay on the same page amid the chaos.\nAs it turns out, there's a faster (and potentially easier) way to beat the Pawns in Cuphead, and it would've been nice to know before I took on the all-in-one-go King's Gauntlet.\nThe strat: Playing as Ms. Chalice, it's possible to double-jump, bounce off a falling pawn's head with her forward-dashing parry, then gain enough height to reach the top of the screen and continue the parry combo until it's checkmate, better luck next time.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Cuphead/comments/w1lt6r/beat_the_rooks_without_touching_the_ground/\nHere's a demonstration from Reddit user ERROR1010101010 (ignore the mislabel; they were \"tired\"), as well as a similar 10-second clear from Sarojam on YouTube. Again, you'll want to be Ms. Chalice — she's got an aerial advantage over Cuphead and Mugman.\nI tested out the method, and sure enough, it's pretty slick. It took a handful of attempts to pull off — I struggled to keep track of Ms. Chalice up top — but it can work, and when it does, it's a super-fast clear. With practice and good positioning, it's repeatable.\nIt's been fun to talk about facing Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, yet I feel like the King's Leap bosses haven't been discussed as much. Did y'all steamroll them? The chaotic Pawns and the just-get-on-with-it-already Knight were the hardest of the pack for me.\nBy the way, did you rebind the controls? I could never finish Cuphead with the (pretty baffling) default dash/dodge input. I need that to be R1 or else.\nThe post There’s a better way to beat the Pawns in Cuphead, and I wish I would’ve known appeared first on Destructoid.",

And while it was certainly a return to more of Travis Touchdown and his usual action and antics, it also had some technical hurdles to overcome.\nFrequent load times were a point of contention in our review, and performance woes seemed to affect the general consensus. There's hope, then, that No More Heroes 3 arriving on platforms with more hardware power to spare could help smooth out those edges. XSEED and Grasshopper say that these new platforms will see improved HD visuals and framerates, as well as faster load times.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdHpJ3TVio\nBut for some other players, this might be their chance to finally experience the next step of Travis Touchdown's journey. Though other games have since been ported around, this finally brings the third entry out to most gaming devices. It'll be on PS4 and PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and the Windows Store. The Xbox versions will support Smart Delivery, too.\nFor those hoping to finally see Travis leap onto next-gen consoles, the wait's not much longer. No More Heroes 3 hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 11.\nThe post No More Heroes 3 heads to new platforms in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

The arena shooter will now launch on mobile and Nintendo Switch platforms at some point in 2023. The delay was announced in a statement posted by the team.\n\"We are working tirelessly to achieve our vision for Star Wars: Hunters,\" said the studio. \"Our ambition is to create a competitive battle arena game that will entertain for years to come. To ensure we meet the high expectations we are setting for fans globally and ourselves as developers we have made the decision to delay the worldwide launch of Star Wars: Hunters.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U1Al2WmyVc\n\"We understand game delays are frustrating,\" continues the statement, \"however, our top priority is ensuring players will have the best possible experience in the Arena. For those who have been able to join us in the soft launch, we truly appreciate your support and feedback as we work to make Star Wars: Hunters the best it can be. Thank you for your understanding and we'll see you in the arena.\"\nThis is, unfortunately, the second delay that Star Wars: Hunters has experienced since its initial reveal back in February 2021. At the time, Zynga had hoped to launch the title by the end of that year, but was forced to push the street date to 2022. This further delay is no doubt disheartening for the team who, like most studios, have been working under typically fragile conditions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nStar Wars: Hunters will launch in 2023 as a free-to-play title on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Zynga’s Star Wars: Hunters has been pushed back to 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's bolstering the cast with some classic Mario characters, and also adding some new gear and stadiums to mix up the action on the field.\nDaisy and Shy Guy both join the Mario Strikers: Battle League roster on July 22, as part of the game's free update. Also included in the update is Knight Gear, a set of gear that focuses on shooting and strength, and the Desert Rain Stadium.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29qaA3suXBk\nDaisy is a Technique-type player who's difficult to knock down. Shy Guy, meanwhile, is an all-rounder. Personally, I just really dig Shy Guy's special shot. He basically turns himself into a bullet and launches himself at the ball, and it's fantastic.\nMore Mario sports\nIt looks like Mario Strikers: Battle League will carry on the usual model for Mario sports games on the Switch. Both Mario Tennis Aces and Mario Golf: Super Rush got a series of updates post-launch, adding characters and more options to the action. They were also free updates, which is a nice alternative to a DLC drip-feed.\nIt feels like Mario Strikers: Battle League is destined for a similar lifespan to those games. I do hope some of the post-launch content eventually addresses the lack of solo options noted in our review of Battle League. As much fun as beating your friends at Mario soccer is, having something to do on the road is nice too.\nAs for the character choices so far, Daisy and Shy Guy seem like fun additions. My petition: get some wild, out-there picks in the Mario Strikers roster. You just know Wiggler would be a wild addition to the lineup. Maybe even a guest character?\nMario Strikers: Battle League is out now on the Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Mario Strikers Battle League adds Daisy and Shy Guy in first free update appeared first on Destructoid.",

And rather than through a story or gameplay trailer, it's through some off-the-screen footage of Yakuza 8 in a studio tour.\nAs shared by Famitsu, MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura recently posted a behind-the-scenes tour of Sega's headquarters. He spends the video chatting with developers, but what really caught attention was a moment where a screen shows several Like a Dragon characters in what appears to be Yakuza 8.\nhttps://twitter.com/famitsu/status/1549363407614185472\nIchiban, Nanba, and Adachi all appear in this scene. The Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist appears to have a different haircut again, though it seems like his hair might be tied back rather than cut short.\nReturn of the dragon\nThe development team confirmed that the next Yakuza story would be a follow-up to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, so seeing these characters again makes sense. This was alongside a larger shake-up at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, which saw longtime director Toshihiro Nagoshi depart the studio. The Yakuza creator would later reveal his own studio, Nagoshi Studio, under the NetEase banner.\nAs for the next Yakuza game? This is the first glimpse we've seen of it. We did get confirmation last year that the Yakuza series would not just carry on the Like a Dragon story, but its RPG combat as well. It seems like the brawler action will live on with Lost Judgement and other games from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.\nHopefully this is a sign that we'll see more of the next Yakuza soon. Yakuza: Like a Dragon was a major departure for the series, with a new core cast and entirely new battle system. But it was incredibly charming, and I'm pretty down to spend some more time with this disaster-person RPG party.\nThe post Yakuza 8 images surface in behind-the-scenes video appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Yoshida I trust\nThe Final Fantasy XVI combat system is surely going to be polarizing when it arrives, even if it nails the action blueprint it's trying to accomplish. Producer Naoki \"Yoshi P\" Yoshida knows this, and recently spoke to Famitsu (as translated by VGC) on the matter, providing some interesting insight into why the series will continue down an action-oriented path.\nYoshida says the decision on where to take Final Fantasy XVI combat is a multi-faceted issue, citing \"the past decade\" of some users questioning command-based video games, the opinions of younger audiences who don't play RPGs, and the sheer march of time and technology. Yoshida explains:\n\"For several console generations now, all character expressions can be done in real-time. Actions such as ‘press the trigger and your character will shoot a gun’... can now be easily expressed without going through a command system. \"It’s now common for gamers younger than me to love such games. As a result, it seems that it does not make sense to go through a command prompt, such as ‘Battle’, to make a decision during a battle.\"\n\nI heard a good anecdote recently about how much trust Yoshida invokes on the Into the Nexus podcast (which normally covers Heroes of the Storm, but has shifted into several games, including FFXIV). One of the hosts mentioned that they were enamored by Final Fantasy XIV mostly by a string of Yoshida interviews, and how much confidence he had in the game and the production team.\nThat's kind of how I feel about Final Fantasy XVI. I'm not fully sold yet, but I'm much more confident in it compared to the last few mainline entries: at least initially.\nThe post Final Fantasy XVI producer explains why the combat system moved away from turn based appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Extinction is Forever\nAfter several long, painstaking years of development, developer Herobeat is finally ready to let the cubs run free. Today sees the arrival of the dramatic, evocative, eco-conscious adventure title Endling — available to purchase now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nSet against the backdrop of a planet that has eaten itself alive with carelessness and selfish avarice, Endling is the tale of a mother vixen — the last adult fox alive — who leaves the decreasing safety of her den to guide her three cubs out into an uncaring world in search of a safe haven in which they may hopefully survive, thrive, and perhaps even find a sliver of light for the future of their own species.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiM2_XB_HZE\nAs the watchful mother, it is the player's task to guide the cubs through a hazardous side-scrolling world, providing safety and sustenance while raising the youngsters to adapt to the terrain, predators, and prey encountered en route. Against the backdrop of man's hostility to man, the heroic family must defy seemingly impossible odds if they are to see tomorrow, with danger beckoning from every bracket, roadway, and shadow.\nEndling utilizes effective visual storytelling, an evocative score, and beautifully stylized visuals to tell a tale of hope, despair, adventure, and bravery, all underlined with a desperate message of survival. I first wrote about Endling back in 2019, and that feels a whole other world away. I write this sweltering in my chair, as England is experiencing, legitimately, the highest heat temperatures since records began. On a global, ecological, and socio-political basis, times have sure changed in the short years since Endling began development, with its underlying message ringing truer today than it did scant years ago.\nEndling is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Heartstring-tugging eco-adventure Endling begins its journey today appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, while the 3DS eShop is set to be destroyed on March 27, 2023, at least one game will be removed earlier than that: Fire Emblem Fates. Yep, the Fire Emblem Fates eShop version's days are numbered.\nVia a new tweet from Nintendo UK, we now know that Fire Emblem Fates will be wiped from the 3DS eShop on February 28, 2023. There's a twist, though.\nSo because of the way Fire Emblem Fates was designed, you can't access all of the DLC until you've finished Chapter 6. To accommodate for that, you can buy the DLC for it through March 27, 2023. Yeah, it's weird. Nintendo essentially sees this as a grace period, so people don't buy the core game, then get locked out of DLC entirely. Now, after buying Fates, you have roughly a month to access the DLC.\nThe whole thing is odd, and the workaround needed to ensure that people don't get locked out just begs the question: with Nintendo's coffers, why not just keep the eShop running longer? This seems like it's bending over backward to accommodate a first-party game that's still seemingly selling, so why not allow that legacy to continue unfettered?\nAh well, this is the digital future many people warned you about over a decade ago!\nThe post Nintendo says Fire Emblem Fates will be removed from the eShop a month before the store goes offline appeared first on Destructoid.",

Shaped into a machine of exquisite violence by his grandfather Heihachi, Jin's newfound abilities will be put to the test in The King of Iron Fist Tournament — a competition that will pit the greatest warriors on the planet in brutal, unarmed combat. Of course, young Kazama is likely about to learn that those seeking vengeance should first dig two graves.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6-donCAnCc\nThe trailer features a real who's who of Tekken characters old and new, with mainstays such as Xiaoyu, Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Julia Chang, and Hwaorang locking horns with newer stars such as Tekken 7's top-tier DLC character Leroy Smith. This is, of course, not Tekken's first rodeo when it comes to anime, having taken a stab at animation in previous efforts such as 1997's Tekken: The Motion Picture and 2011 CGI effort Tekken: Blood Vengeance.\nPersonally, I'm not really a fan of the facial designs here. I also think some of the voices seem oddly unsuited to the ages/nationalities of their owners, but Netflix does have a decent pedigree in regards to video game anime adaptations, so I'll be giving the new Tekken tale the benefit of the doubt until I'm finally able to check it out next month. What do you think? Is this new trailer working out for you?\nTekken: Bloodline premieres on Netflix August 18\nThe post Tekken: Bloodline anime will throw hands on Netflix next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bandai Namco Japan was working on an online action-RPG known as Blue Protocol, so there are similarities there, but that title has been quiet since an announcement made during the Bandai Namco Studio Creators' Night live stream — which was held way back in the fall of 2021.\nIt seems that this is simply going to be one of those cases where we just have to wait and see until the veteran developer/publisher is ready to play its hand.

At least, not yet. Granted, I don't keep up with the service as much these days beyond the occasional headline, but it's a bit surprising to hear that 15 games are leaving Apple Arcade.\nAs reported by TouchArcade and The Verge, the timeline is hazy at best.\nA new section in Apple Arcade lists the following games as leaving \"soon\":\nAtone: Heart of the Elder Tree\nBattleSky Brigade: Harpooner\nCardpocalypse\nDead End Job\nDon’t Bug Me!\nDread Nautical\nEarthNight\nExplottens\nLifeslide\nOver the Alps\nProjection: First Light\nSpelldrifter\nSpidersaurs\nTowaga: Among Shadows\nVarious Daylife\nRecognize any of them? You might if you were there in the beginning.\nI know a few off the top of my head — most notably Spidersaurs, a WayForward run-and-gun game that's now on other platforms like Nintendo Switch, and Various Daylife, a strangely named Square Enix RPG. Many, but not all, have been ported elsewhere.\n[caption id=\"attachment_335442\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1440\"] Towaga: Among Shadows, one of the planned game removals, is also playable on Steam.[/caption]\nAnother day, another delisting\nWe've been conditioned to expect that movies, shows, and games won't stick around indefinitely when they're lumped together in ever-shifting, ever-more-competitive libraries. A proper heads-up with removal dates is half the battle.\nI just hope that in Apple Arcade's case, players aren't out of luck when it comes to their game data; the service is in a unique place with no in-app purchases or ads. It would be a shame to invest time and energy into an Apple Arcade title only for it to drop off the list with no other way of picking up the pieces.

          "description": "Dealt a winning hand\nInscryption was one of the more bizarre and compelling games to come out of last year. And next month, Daniel Mullins Games' creepy deckbuilder will hit consoles.\nPublisher Devolver Digital confirms today that Inscryption arrives for PlayStation on August 30, 2022. The store listing is up now for the PS5 version, and Devolver has said it's also coming to PS4.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAn7OxLub9Y\nAs for what's coming for the PlayStation version? Well, it wouldn't be Inscryption if things didn't get weird. And some of the new features that PlayStation players will get sound downright unnerving.\nCabin in the woods\nWhen it was highlighted in a recent indie roundup for PlayStation, Daniel Mullins teased that Inscryption would use some of the PlayStation's haptics in particular.\n\"But what about those exclusive features I mentioned earlier? Well, for starters your faithful companion, a talking Stoat card, will play its audio out of your controller as if it’s really in your hands! Secondly, the atmospheric lighting in the game will spill out from your controller, so if you’re playing in the dark you’ll be one step closer to feeling like you’re inside Leshy’s cabin. If we’re adding sound and lighting to the PlayStation experience then it only makes sense to ensure that Haptic feedback enhances every grisly action… why not use the pliers and find out?\"\n\nAs for how the game will handle some of the more computer-y parts of Inscryption, I'm interested to see. Games like Doki Doki Literature Club have found some clever workarounds for that in the past, and Inscryption uses some elements that will be curious to see adapted to a PlayStation.\nGiven the track record though, I think it's safe to say the crew at Daniel Mullins Games to find a way to make it work, though. PlayStation players will get to build their decks and duel for survival on August 30.\nThe post Inscryption hits PlayStation near the end of August appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fimbulwinter, here we come\nThe follow-up to Sony Santa Monica's God of War has to be one of the most anticipated games of the past few years, and as we get closer and closer to that November release date, fans are getting a closer look into what the game has to offer. The last story nugget we got was from the game's cinematic trailer, which confirmed that players will be able to visit all nine realms, but now God of War: Ragnarok has been listed on the PlayStation Store (initially reported by The Gamer), so we can finally get a look at the full story synopsis.\nThe listing reads as follows: \"From Santa Monica Studio comes the sequel to the critically acclaimed God of War (2018). Fimbulwinter is well underway. Kratos and Atreus must journey to each of the Nine Realms in search of answers as Asgardian forces prepare for a prophesied battle that will end the world.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIQGI36BxDE\n\"Along the way they will explore stunning, mythical landscapes, and face fearsome enemies in the form of Norse gods and monsters. The threat of Ragnarök grows ever closer. Kratos and Atreus must choose between their own safety and the safety of the realms.\"\nSo now we know the game won't just be taking place during Ragnarok itself, the epic final battle of the gods in Norse mythology, but will also take place in the era that comes directly before it: Fimbulwinter. We already know that Thor and Kratos don't quite get along, and given the fresh take that SMS is giving us on the God of Thunder we know and love, it's going to be interesting to see how Ragnarok shakes things up in the series.\nThe game's release is approaching quickly after some delays, but something tells me that this is a title that will have been worth waiting for.\nThe post God of War: Ragnarok full story synopsis revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, the team at Motion Twin shared an updated roadmap for the future of Dead Cells, which is set to carry into 2023 and contains some big things.\nThe team says this update is specifically to combat the belief that, after the latest DLC, Dead Cells is at or near the end of its lifespan.\nCurrently planned for 2022 is the panchaku update and flame head outfit, as well as some rebalancing and reworking. Then this fall, Motion Twin plans to launch a Boss Rush mode for Dead Cells.\nMore updates are set for winter as well.

Motion Twin says it will be the biggest year since the Dead Cells 1.0 launch.\n\"What we're getting at here is that we're very much in the mid-life of Dead Cells.

This period has seen an incredible 91.4 million Legends Mode missions played, a staggering 540.8 million Duels engaged, and — perhaps the most amazing stat of all — a huge 998.5 million pulse-pounding Standoffs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3TXsfTCs\nStill, despite these bewildering sales numbers, the aforementioned stats are not the greatest Ghost of Tsushima milestones offered by the report. That title is bestowed upon the island's own Good Boys — the foxes — which have been petted by players 75.18 million times. This is perhaps the most relatable of all the statistics, as the foxes are one of the few activities on Tsushima island that provides respite from all the violence and bloodletting. Glory be to the foxes. Here's hoping that they make an appearance in the upcoming film adaptation.\nYou can check out the full list of statistics in the tweet below. Ghost of Tsushima is available now on PS4, while Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is available to purchase on PS5. This latter edition includes the Iki Island expansion, along with 4K visuals, improved load times, new filters, a Japanese lip-sync option, and support for DualSense capabilities.\nhttps://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1548034687049748480?s=20&t=aiQIJEh8383uIkkiVOGjTA\nThe post Ghost of Tsushima sells nearly 10 million copies, pets 75 million foxes appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the base game will still launch on July 29, the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition contents won't roll out for Europe until after the game's launch.\nIn a statement, Nintendo says that due to \"unforeseen logistical challenges,\" the company is unable to open pre-orders for the collector's edition until after the game launches.\nRather than hold off on selling the game, Nintendo will be offering the contents of the Collector's Edition as a separate purchase. That way fans can purchase Xenoblade Chronicles 3 at launch and not have to re-buy the software.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-iNpDKuYb8\nThe Collector's Edition includes a softcover concept art book, a steel case, and the outer packaging that holds everything.\nPre-orders for the Collector's Edition contents will open sometime later in September. The special contents of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition are expected to be delivered sometime around autumn 2022, and all items will be shipped with free delivery. You can sign up for updates on the Nintendo UK site as well.\n\nA sought-after special edition\nThe rollout of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition hasn't been smooth sailing. The online store has had a few pre-order windows, and they were usually accompanied by waves of people sitting in a long virtual queue and not making it in. The online storefront even crashed for some. Nintendo has to host several waves of releases as it resolved issues with purchasing physical products on the My Nintendo Store.\nWhether this will still be a sought-after Collector's Edition in September, we'll see. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is due out later this month on July 29. As Chris wrote in our preview, the RPG is so far everything he needed it to be.\nThe post Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector’s Edition delayed for Europe past the game’s launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In case you missed it, the platforming roguelite Eyes in the Dark: The Curious Case of One Victoria Bloom launched last week. The game’s reveal caught my eye thanks to its striking art direction and unique gameplay. I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters. Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets. \nI’m enjoying the game, but it took longer than I would’ve liked to get used to its strange control scheme. Eyes in the Dark plays like a twin-stick shooter, with players using the left stick for movement and the right stick to aim their auto-damagi…",

          "description": "Far from describing a game with adventure in it (that would include a lot of games!), the adventure genre is loosely defined as one that emphasizes narrative and exploration over action, which may also rely on light puzzle mechanics. In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts. Shooting for games that are rolling around in the zeitgeist right now, some of the genres’ towering giants are not listed here.

These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. \n\n\nNo More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: \n“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”",

Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will \"carry forward our vision for the game.\"\nThe blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: \nLast December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.",

Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. \n\nThe Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”\nThe Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99.

          "description": "MMA fighter Mikuru Asakura enjoyed his tour of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, capturing footage of the various workspaces, Sega president Haruki Satomi (he conducted the tour), and even some new Yakuza screenshots. Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. \n\n\nLike a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  \nThe off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)\nJuly 19, 2022\nIn any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:\n\"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series.\"\n\nI'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not. \n[Source: Famitsu via VGC]",

          "description": "In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. \nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.\nWe were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.\nYou can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

          "description": "Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!\n\n\nMarcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.\nOn top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.",

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. \nFull Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile. \nAs a FTP game, Skate will have microtransactions, but the team wants …",

The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.\nThe peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. \n\n\nWe still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far.

The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens \"where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\"\nThere’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.\nThis project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.",

Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.\nLoyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.\" Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. \nThese collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  \n“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.\nPlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!",

Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros.

The game was set to arrive in February before being delayed and has been playable through various technical tests. \nFirst announced during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse is a free-to-play battle royale where players duke it out by brawling instead of shooting. Wrestling moves like suplexes and clotheslines reign supreme, and weapons include steel chairs and other melee items. Players can even climb up structures to face off on rooftops and leap between buildings. Rumbleverse supports cross-play and cross-progression between consoles and PC. \n\n\nRumbleverse launches on August 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via The Epic Games Store.

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games' protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.\nWhen Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. \n\n\nPlatinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. \n\nBayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28.

Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.\nReferred to as \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title,\" a Senior Environment Artist post states:\nA single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.\nWhat do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.\nThe trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.\nTeyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",
