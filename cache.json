We were thrilled to learn that Ubisoft Montpellier is the team crafting this new adventure as its past games like Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends were incredibly unique works of art, and The Lost Crown quickly joined the ranks of games we’re most looking forward to in 2024.\nWhile our time with The Lost Crown was smooth, snappy, and seems like a promising title for Metroid fans, we didn’t really consider that this new entry could be straying too far away from what made the Sands of Time trilogy and Jordan Mechner's original games so special. There are plenty of titles vying for the throne shared by Samus and the Belmonts, so will this crown lose its luster over time compared to its contemporaries or can this Prince weather the sandstorm that lies ahead?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Ma(rio) baker.\nIt’s been rough out there for Paper Mario fans. Over the past several entries Nintendo has tested new ideas that haven’t come together anywhere near as well as the original games did, and there's good reason for the joy surrounding the return of Thousand-Year Door in 2024. Some indie developers, however, have tried to recapture the magic of the original releases with titles such as Citizens of Space and Bug Fables. Many have even succeeded in recreating Paper Mario's look and feel while adding some cool new ideas, and now Wildarts Studio has served up its own take. Born of Bread is a cute and summery RPG following the adventures of a sentient bread boy. It has its issues, which we'll get into, but overall this is an enjoyable little RPG that we’d suggest you investigate.\nBorn of Bread’s story begins with a group of researchers messing around in some ancient ruins and accidentally resurrecting a group of evil beings from a long-forgotten empire, and they’re hellbent on collecting the magical Sunstones scattered across the land so they can bring back their master. Luckily, on the same night that this happens, the royal baker for the queen accidentally creates Loaf, a magical doughboy with a heart of gold and the potential to be a great hero. After the queen’s castle is assaulted by these newcomers and Loaf’s ‘father’ is unfairly implicated in the resurrection, Loaf sets out on a grand quest to clear the baker’s name, learn more about the mysterious villains blighting the land, and hopefully find the remaining Sunstones before they fall into the wrong hands.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.\nBut I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.\nNow, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.\nRead more",

          "description": "A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. \r\n\n\r\nIn the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is \"nope\" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up. \r\n \nRead more",

This book contains scenes of graphic violence!\" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. \"Knee-deep in the dead!\" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.\nThe cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve \"Body Bag\" Behling and Michael \"Splatter\" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: \"Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'\"\nRead more",

I think that the popularity of \"looting\", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.\nI distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.\nRead more",

It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.\nNow, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.\nRead more",

Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.\r\n\n\r\nFrom what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones. At the same time, the playtest build was conspicuously short on much of what makes Tribes really feel like Tribes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. \nSo Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000.

          "description": "Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.\nA spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her \"Ascend\" to the afterlife.\nRead more",

          "description": "In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. \nAt the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date. \nRead more",

          "description": "A year or two ago I interviewed an actual, practising witch, the wonderful Damien Crawford of Purgatory Dungeoneer fame, about how videogames represent magic. I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.\nIn this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0. Here's the latest trailer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "“When people read anything, no matter the source, they will believe it.” So says Doom designer John Romero on the subject of his relationship with John Carmack. Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.\nYet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Blíží se Vánoce - odpočinkový čas určený nejen rodině, domácnosti ale i celý rok zanedbávaným projektům. Nemůžete se rozhodnout, na čem budete mezi vánočními svátky pracovat? Pojďte se pobavit na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online setkání bastlířů, elektrotechniků a obecně nadšenců do techniky, pořádaném bastlířskou dílnou MacGyver. Pro rozproudění konverzace si strahovští bastlíři přichystali několik zajímavých témat a novinek. Ukáží proto novou verzi SDK pro Picopad kompatibilní s oficiálním Pico SDK, nový pěkný hotplate s nastavitelným profilem pájení nebo ST-Link kombinovaný s power profilerem od Nordicu. Pokud máte rádi měřící techniku, žasnete nad zbrusu novou a velice zajímavou napěťovou referenci (tak novou, že ještě není na trhu). \r\n\r\nZe světa HW strahováci zmíní, jak vypadá zevnitř střela Javelin nebo vojenský dron Baba Yaga. Zapomenout ale nemůžou ani na ukázky toho, jaké různé hacky nové Hackaday Badge už vznikly. Dozvíte se, kde sehnat napěťové a odporové reference pro kalibrace multimetrů. Nebo třeba jak poznat měřením rozdíl mezi berylliovou keramikou a běžnou nebo jak připojovat mikrosondy přímo na křemík integrovaných obvodů.\r\n\r\nA aby byla legrace, zmíní i nějaké bizarnosti jako USB-C zdroj na DIN lištu, novou verzi ReactOS chodící na UEFI (někdy), simulátor černobylského reaktoru nebo ATX zdroj plněný kovovými pilinami.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 14. prosince od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Although the promised accessibility update and New Game Plus mode haven't launched yet, more features are coming.\n\n\nThe developer announced that more features are coming to Marvel's Spider-Man 2 via Twitter. It didn't give a specific month, but does state the next update will drop in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe most exciting feature announced is replaying missions, since it'll allow players to replay their favorite moments without starting over. Others, like changing tendril colors, are neat touches that add customization, and changing the time of day is great for setting up the perfect shot in photo mode.\n\n\nNew Game Plus is obviously a big one too, as is the accessibility update which is set to add Audio Descriptions. While the former gives players a reason to jump back in, Audio Descriptions could be a huge help for players who haven't been able to start Marvel's Spider-Man 2 just yet.\n\n\nThese additions are also just what's outlined, as Insomniac states in its post that even more are coming. It's honestly in line with how the studio has treated its previous games, adding new features and options some time after launch.\n\n\nIt is nice seeing these updates be as comprehensive as they are and at no additional cost. Hopefully, this trend of new features coming out for free continues for Insomniac. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was up for seven awards at this year's Game Awards, but didn't manage to take home any trophies from the night.\n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 will get its next game update in early 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following uncomfortable close to the Xbox and PlayStation Year in Review roundups, Nintendo has provided its own.\n\n\nLike most other year-in-review wrap-ups, Nintendo shows you the number of hours played on your Switch (Switches, if you’re fancy), what games you prefer, and further breakdowns beyond that. Unlike the PlayStation round-up, it doesn’t try to tell you your horoscope; instead, it just gives you the facts. I’m going to take a guess here, but it’s statistically likely that your top-played game this year was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Mine is, and I didn’t even finish it.\n\n\nHere are some more Year in Review facts about me, which you can totally skip if you don’t care. I put in 295 hours across 58 games. I mostly play on PC and retro consoles these days. Aside from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, my top played games are Pikmin 4 (which I still haven’t finished post-game on) and Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse. Hey! I really like those games.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are some good memories here. I can’t believe I only played 6 hours of Metal Slug. That’s more than the 2 hours I put into Super Mario Wonder. I can totally believe I put 14 hours into Paranormasight. Did you know I played through the entirety of Metroid Prime Remastered in 14 hours before I reviewed it? What I really learned here is that I spent quite a few months of this year feeling depressed and burnt out between deep dives of review games. What a year!\n\n\nYou can stare into your soul, if you want, by just going to this page here and checking your Year in Review. You can even tell Nintendo what your favorite game this year was. Don’t disappoint them!\n\nThe post Nintendo is the latest to jump into the Year in Review 2023 party appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lightbulb Crew, the developer behind 2020’s Othercide, have announced their next game, Nova Hearts. A departure from their last game, Nova Hearts is a “turn-based combat dating adventure game.” The first episode, Nova Hearts: The Spark will be out on January 17, 2024.\n\n\nI know what you’re thinking, but if I understand correctly, the combat and the dating are separate. It’s not like you invite someone to a date on American Gladiators. You don’t pummel the affection out of them.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, a “mysterious cosmic force” gives a number of people in town superpowers, which inevitably leads some to use their powers for good and others for evil. That’s fertile ground for the seeds of love to be planted. In Nova Hearts, you “text, chat, and date” your friends and enemies, with your relationship choices affecting the course of the narrative. Hopefully, this means that I can just seduce everyone and have them fight for my affections.\n\n\nWhen you’re not trying to get into the tights of those around you, you also fight against monstrosities from another dimension. This takes place in turn-based battles where you “use your strategic know-how, stylish combos, and the tactical timeline” to win the day.\n\n\nCrossing anything with a dating sim is a great way to get my attention. Why do I like Mass Effect? Dating. What does Baldur’s Gate 3 have that makes it so engrossing? Dating. It isn’t always a formula for success, but it’s basically the soy sauce of game design. Add a dash of it to any game to really bring out the umami.\n\n\nNova Hearts: The Spark will be released on PC on January 17, 2024. It will be available for free with the rest of the tale planned for release in Summer 2024.\n\nThe post Nova Hearts is a combat dating game from the devs of Othercide appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The original Doom recently celebrated its 30th anniversary, making me feel quite old. As well as being an early blueprint for the FPS genre, id Software's iconic shooter is also a popular modding playground. Sometimes, these mods harken back to even older gaming days.\n\n\nModders Gokuma and Kontra Kommando have crafted a love letter to an absolute classic '80s slasher film. Specifically, they've turned Doom into Friday the 13th. More specifically still, they've based it on the NES adaptation, turning the 1989 side-scrolling game into a first-person shooter.\n\n\nImage via Team Retro-FPS/ModDB.\n\n\nSet in Camp Crystal Lake – as you would expect – the mod brings back Jason Voorhees to \"slaughter all those that would dare to step foot\" into the camp. It's up to Doomguy to stop him, presumably. Currently, there's no full release date, but you can download the current beta from ModDB to try it out.\n\n\nLife before Doom\n\n\nIt's interesting to see this kind of mod. While it could have been just set in the Friday the 13th universe in any respect, the creators chose to breathe new life (resurrect, if you will) into a game that's even older than Doom.\n\n\nA lot has certainly changed over the decades for the plucky FPS. Thirty years is a long time in any form of media, but to see id Software's legendary 1993 release keep coming back for more is a strong testament to just how important the game has been to the industry.\n\n\nThere are so many Doom mods out there, some of which change up the formula immensely, not to mention the countless ways of porting the game. There's not really anything else like it in the video game world, so hats off to the studio for bringing it to us.\n\nThe post Doom meets Camp Crystal Lake in this Friday the 13th mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bandai Namco is continuing with their Tekken 8 character highlight trailers, this time putting the spotlight on the enigmatic Yoshimitsu.\n\n\nFun fact (not really), I never really got into the Tekken series, but whenever I did play, it was either using Mokujin (if available) or Yoshimitsu. That’s largely because Bandai Namco has a Yoshimitsu in the Soul Calibur series. They may or may not be the same guy. I’m not really up on my lore.\n\n\n\n\nThis trailer is so rad. One part of it harkens back to Yoshimitsu’s victory cinematic against Bryan Fury. There are probably other references in there, but as I said, I’m a dilettante. Most of the trailer focuses on a demonstration of the Manji Ninjitsu fighting style, as well as the thirsty Cursed Blade Yoshimitsu. The trailer also caps off with his rage art, as is customary in these trailers.\n\n\nYoshimitsu’s design changes heavily in each Tekken game. While the theme is always cyborg ninja, he varies from being more samurai or buglike with each iteration. This time around, we got a good mix with some cosmic highlights. The armor is obviously Japanese-inspired but has a very chitinous look to it. Even with the new design, the over-the-top chivalry and weird goofiness are intact.\n\n\nWhile this trailer is a deep dive into the character, we already knew that Yoshimitsu would be in Tekken 8. Truly, it would be strange if he wasn't. He's part of a pretty hefty cast of 32 characters in the base game.\n\n\nTekken 8 releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 26, 2024. The PS5 demo arrives on December 14, 2023, followed by PC and Xbox on December 21, 2023.\n\nThe post Mainstay character Yoshimitsu highlighted in latest Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

But still, the studio is keeping that spaceship flying with some new features coming in the future.\n\n\nExpect updates for Starfield every six weeks\n\n\nIn a recent post on Reddit, a spokesperson for the developer has said the team is grateful for all the feedback they've received.

A report suggested it was not being worked on by any studio, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says it's still in development. So where does that leave us?\n\n\nCut to a few weeks later, and Disney's head of gaming – Sean Shoptaw – may have given us a bit more hope. According to Axios, when asked about the possibility of reviving the much-loved Star Wars game, the exec said there's not \"a lot I can say on that point for some hopefully obvious reasons.\"\n\n\nImage via BioWare/Steam.\n\n\nThe quote goes on to say that \"KOTOR is obviously an incredibly popular game, one that we are incredibly proud of and think that there's still a lot of demand for,\" before ending with, \"I'll leave it there.\"\n\n\nLeaving money on the table\n\n\nGiven the sheer legacy of the original Knights of the Old Republic, it would seem remiss for Disney to not offer up an official remake of it. Right now, we're in something of a golden age for remakes and remasters, so it would make sense.\n\n\nHowever, at this moment in time, things are still up in the air. KOTOR came out in 2003 and is generally regarded as one of the best Star Wars adaptations in gaming. To not bring it back feels like a wasted opportunity, for both old fans and those who never played it the first time round.\n\n\nMake of Shoptaw's words what you will, but a lot of people will still be hanging onto the idea that Knights is coming back.

According to the document, Atari owns a non-controlling stake of 53% of the company.\n\n\nThe year has seen quite a few acquisitions by Atari. While it started out by buying back catalogs of game properties, they later announced the acquisition of Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, two of the top developers focused on remasters, rereleases, and overall preservation of video games. In July, they announced their partnership with Playmaji along with a “minority investment,” and now we can see that came at the price tag of €4.6 million\n\n\nAs someone who only really heard of P…",

We got the music ones out of the way like Apple and Spotify, so now it’s time for us gamers to bother our mutuals. PlayStation and Xbox have just now released their year-in-review wrap-up stats apps.\n\n\nBetween now and January 12, 2024, people who have played on the PS4 or PS5 consoles will be given a breakdown of what they did in 2023 regarding all things gaming. It’ll start with what your first game of the year was, then your most played games, highlighting your favorite genre of the year, and so forth. \n\n\nXbox players’ “Year in Review” will do basically the same, showing your overall playtime, showcasing your most played month, a piechart breakdown of genres from this year, and so forth. Graphics can be screenshotted for easy sharing on your preferred social media platforms. \n\n\n\n\nThese stats will keep updating until the end of 2023, so things might change!\n\n\nHow to see your year in review for Xbox or PlayStation\n\n\nFor PlayStation players, head over to wrapup.playstation.com and sign in with your Sony account. This can be accessed via mobile device or PC. You can revisit this page as many times as you like between now and when the event is over. You also do not need an active PS Plus subscription or any sort of additional things to view this.\n\n\nFor Xbox players, head over to xbox.com/year-in-review to check your stats. The same applies here as with PlayStation. Simply enter your login credentials and get a thorough breakdown of all your gaming activity on this platform in 2023. \n\nThe post PlayStation and Xbox year in review apps are live for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

They will be available for preorder on December 14 at 9am PST.\n\n\nIf you’re already deeply invested in owning the series’ soundtracks pressed in vinyl, your soul will feel incomplete without these two. Both the Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden albums appear to be supplemental single LP albums, containing only music unique to their versions of the game. The bulk of the tunes are already on the Persona 3 and Persona 4 vinyl releases, both of which weighed in on four discs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, if you’re looking for the most enduring songs from the two games, you’d probably be better off with the vanilla versions. Persona 4 Golden, for example, doesn’t include Heartbeat, Heartbreak, a song that has been playing on a loop inside my skull for about a decade.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t look like these two albums are going to fit in the Persona 25th Anniversary Slipcase. They will have to sit cold and alone beyond the embracing walls of the rest of the collection. On the positive, their covers are done by Drew Wise, a longtime contributor with Iam8bit and the artist who did all the 25th Anniversary covers. The Persona 3 Portable cover is even a mirror of the vanilla Persona 3 cover, but features the version’s exclusive female protagonist instead.\n\n\nBoth the Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden vinyl will be up for preorder on December 14, 2023 at 9am PST. Both albums will run you $31.99 American greenbacks.\n\nThe post Finish your Persona vinyl collection with iam8bit’s Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden Soundtracks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been eight years since developer MidBoss released 2064: Read Only Memories, but we're inching ever closer to a return to Neo-San Francisco. A new trailer arrived for Read Only Memories: Neurodiver with yet another updated release window, this time penciling the cyperpunk sequel in for sometime in the first half of 2024.\n\n\nWhen Neurodiver was first announced in June 2019, it was planned for a 2020 launch on PC and Mac. More platforms were added as the release window slipped further. It was moved to Q1 2021, then Q1 2022, and finally Q3 2023 before the latest jump to spring 2024. That release is currently set for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can see some of the characters, story, and inspiration behind the series in the trailer below, complete with narration from creative director John \"JJSignal\" James. \n\n\n\n\nNeurodiver has ES88 attempting to track down a rogue psychic known as Golden Butterfly, who is hiding in the memories of others and slowly corrupting them. With an ever-changing form, Golden Butterfly's motivation is a mystery. It's up to you to use your own psychic abilities and your genetically-engineered Neurodiver creature to connect with the fragmented memories, repair them, and ultimately put a stop to Golden Butterfly.\n\n\nThese events are set about five years after the story that went down in 2064. As such, there are a handful of returning cast members you'll get to reunite with, like Lexi and Tomcat. MidBoss is once again attempting to deliver a loving sendup to the Japanese adventure games of yore, and that love is particularly potent in the FM synth-infused soundtrack. If you want to sample it all while waiting for launch, the \"Pilot Memory\" demo is currently available on Steam. \n\nThe post Read Only Memories: Neurodiver eyes spring 2024 release, new trailer debuts appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The first limited-time event for Diablo 4, Midwinter Blight, has officially begun. The Midwinter Blight brings with it a period of perpetual darkness and bitter cold that will consume all of Fractured Peaks. As part of the event, players can take on new event quests, upgrade the new event hub, challenge a new event-specific boss, and earn event-specific rewards including a bunch of new cosmetic items.\n\n\n\n\nA new character, Gileon the bard, seeks to reignite the holiday spirit of Kyovashad by enlisting the players help. The event-specific area, Midwinter Square, will allow players to build it up and upgrade it as they slay new Blightfiend enemies around the Fractured Peaks. Several new items can be used to progress the status of the Midwinter Square to unlock new rewards including a mount trophy, class-specific back trophies, weapon cosmetics, the Shard of the Dawn Offensive Legendary Aspect, Gileon's Brew, and more.\n\n\nPlayers can eventually also take on an event-specific boss, the Red-Cloaked Horror.\n\n\nIt looks like the event is only available on Seasonal realms, so those who are playing on the Eternal Realm won't be able to partake without creating a Seasonal character. It seems like an odd choice to not allow characters on the Eternal Realm to join the festive event, but there's probably a reason for it.\n\n\nThe Midwinter Blight event in Diablo 4 is live now and lasts through January 2.\n\n\n\nThe post The Diablo 4 Midwinter Blight event is live now appeared first on Destructoid.",

The free access event kicks off on December 14 and will last through December 18. Players will be able to jump in and have free access to six maps, four multiplayer modes, Modern Warfare Zombies, and three of the Ground War maps.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nThose interested in checking out the multiplayer will have plenty to try out. Here are the maps and modes that are part of the free event:\n\n\n\n6v6 Core Multiplayer Maps: Terminal, Rust, Highrise, Shipment, Afghan, Meat\n\n\nGround War Maps: Popov Power, Orlov Military Base, Levin Resort\n\n\nCore Modes: Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, Kill Confirmed, Ground War, War\n\n\nPlaylists: Rustment 24/7 (Shipment and Rust), War Mode, 6v6 Moshpit (featuring Highrise, Meat, Afghan, Terminal), Ground War, Modern Warfare Zombies\n\n\n\nOverall it's a nice mix of maps. Terminal, Rust, and Shipment are fan favorites, whereas the map Meat is a brand new map. Players will be able to level up very quickly via Rustment 24/7 which will allow them to check out some of the later-level unlocks to see if they like what is there.\n\n\nIt appears the full Modern Warfare Zombies mode will be included in the free access as well, which is worth checking out. Instead of traditional Zombies maps, MW3 features a DMZ/Warzone style open-world Zombies map.\n\n\nThe Call of Duty MW3 Free Access event begins on December 14 at 1 p.m. ET and will run through December 18 at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe post Call of Duty: MW3 multiplayer and zombies are both free this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Well, it's been about a hundredth of a femtosecond, let's see what people are trying to port Doom onto now. Oh my, would you look at that! It appears as though it's possible to get id Software's iconic FPS to \"run\" on cells.\n\n\nIn a meeting of technology and biology, PhD student Lauren \"Ren\" Ramlan at MIT (as shared by Reddit user AnNdPh) has figured out a way to use E. coli cells to sort of run Doom. Now, I'm not scientifically minded, so I don't fully understand how they do it.\n\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell: what they've been able to do is tweak or modify the cells to – for want of a better term – turn them into monitor pixels. This has then allowed them to display the game in a very rudimentary way.\n\n\nI hope you have half a millennium to spare\n\n\nWhile this means the E. coli cells are technically displaying the game rather than actually running it, it's still impressive to see Doom being ported in this way.\n\n\nRen also notes that the game is only able to run at one frame every 8.33 hours. Using this figure, they estimate it would take around 600 years to complete it in its entirety. Even the likes of Skyrim can't compete with that kind of longevity.\n\n\nWith the original Doom recently celebrating its 30th anniversary, the legacy of the iconic shooter continues unabated. One can't help wonder where the FPS genre would be without the 1993 release, but one's thing for sure, no one's running Call of Duty on E. coli cells.\n\nThe post PhD student tries to get Doom running on cells appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sinister Statues is the name of a new mod for Elden Ring that uses a page from the Doctor Who playbook to make combat in the game more terrifying than ever. \n\n\nThe mod essentially turns every enemy into a Weeping Angel by making them entirely immobile whenever they’re observed. From basic mobs to major bosses, everyone is frozen in place as long as you’re looking at them. Sounds like it would make the game a lot easier, right?\n\n\nWell, to be fair, it probably does. In a video showing off the mod, its creator acknowledges that this hasn’t been designed for balance and is really just meant to provide a brand new way to experience the game. But that’s not to say a Sinister Statues playthrough is as easy as walking backward while locking eyes with an enemy. \n\n\n\n\nDon't blink\n\n\nThe mod also adds a new blinking mechanic to the game, which forces you to approach combat in a new way. Every so often your character will blink, turning the screen black and letting enemies swarm you. The lower your health, the longer a single blink takes. You can try to resist blinking by holding down the interact button, but that won’t last forever. Eventually your screen will go dark, and you’d better be far away from any enemies when that happens. \n\n\nThe mod is designed to work alongside almost any other Elden Ring mod. If you want to play in first person, with randomized items, or with any other combination of add-ons, it should work. The only real restriction is that it doesn’t currently function with multiplayer mods. \n\n\nThis is great news for anyone looking to spice up their next playthrough. We’re all still desperately waiting for more news of Shadow of the Erdtree, the upcoming Elden Ring DLC. FromSoftware hasn’t given us a release date yet, but the modding community keeps providing reasons to come back to Elden Ring in the meantime. \n\nThe post Elden Ring has a new mod based off of Doctor Who’s Weeping Angels, and it’s terrifying appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I wasn’t expecting Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion to be remastered. While Nightdive Studios updated and rereleased the PC versions of the first two games, there wasn’t a PC version of Turok 3. They didn't have the source files, so they had to reverse-engineer the N64 version and port it over to their proprietary KEX Engine.\n\n\nIt’s a lot of work to go through, especially when Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is hardly the best game in the series. To put it charitably, it’s mediocre. Neither liquid nor solid. Remastering it was hardly going to be a financial home run.\n\n\nBut, as I said in my review, “It wasn’t the smart thing to do. It was the right thing to do.” The remastered N64 trilogy of Turok games (excluding Rage Wars) would remain incomplete without that last game. For historical context, it …",

Supposedly a comprehensive upgrade to the middle-of-the-road original, House Flipper 2 is about to prove its worth.\n\n\nThe developer, Frozen District, appears to be quite certain of House Flipper 2's quality on day one, December 14. Essentially a game about flipping old, downtrodden houses (in this economy?), House Flipper 2 offers an upgraded feature roster compared to its immediate predecessor. Its most interesting draw? The ability to build houses from the ground-up, if you so desire. \n\n\nImage via Frozen District\n\n\nHouse Flipper 2 releases on December 14\n\n\nOf course, the reviews for House Flipper 2 are pending still, and there's currently no telling whether Frozen District's new offering will outmatch what came before. Yet, the competition in this highly specific simulator niche is basically nil, so all prospective (virtual) house flippers will at least consider a bid on the $39.99 title.\n\n\nThe good news for those who are curious about House Flipper 2, but uncertain whether it's a good investment, is that Frozen District aims to host a 2-hour developer livestream. The stream will be going live at 4 PM CET, and it makes for a perfect opportunity to check the game out without any fuss.\n\n\nFinally, the developer has also announced that House Flipper 2 players can expect a big Community Contest shortly after the game's release. \"We're proud to let you know that in the following days, we will present a ruleset, a list of exclusive rewards, as well as a theme for the first official House Flipper 2 Community Contest, and it is going to be focused around building your own house project,\" wrote Frozen District. \n\n\nA promising start, perhaps, but it remains to be seen whether House Flipper 2 is truly up to the task.\n\nThe post House Flipper 2 launches this week, lets you live out the homeownership fantasy appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was satisfied with how the story wrapped up, although admittedly, I would have liked a more bombastic finale worthy of the name “Ragnarök,” so I wasn’t necessarily looking for new story content just yet.

It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's \"Show Me Mastery\" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. \n\"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?\" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. \nThere is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.\nDecember 12, 2023\nGod of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022.

Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.\nMouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. \n\n\nMouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

The 2020 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but E3 returned for one last bout in 2021 with an all-digital event. The 2022 show was canceled, and this year's event, which was set to happen with ReedPop, was canceled as well. \npic.twitter.com/y6dtVkBvNI\nDecember 12, 2023\nPersonally, while this news comes as no surprise, I'm legitimately sad about it.

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. \nIt was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too. \npic.twitter.com/y6dtVkBvNI\nDecember 12, 2023\n\"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close,\" ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. \"We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.\" \nPierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business \"has blossomed in different ways,\" noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. \"That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.\" \nFor a recap of the history of E3, read The Washington Post's full story here.

More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. \nWhile many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. \n\n\nAs you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. \nIf you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer's Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it.

Now, as 2023 comes to a close, Google has released the top 10 trending searches in games on Google over the year and in the top slot is Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nWhile many were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and information about the game, there's no doubt some of the Google searching for this game stems from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it's based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it. Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. \nAs for what that means, Google describes it like so: \"This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the 'trending' inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022.\" \nWith that in mind, here's the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023: \nHogwarts Legacy – Our Review\nConnections (if you, like me, didn't know what this was, it's a New York Times word grouping puzzle game) \nBaldur's Gate 3 – Our Review\nStarfield – Our Review\nDiablo IV – Our Review\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Our Review\nAtomic Heart – Our Review\nDead Island 2 – Our Review\nSons of the Forest\nMortal Kombat 1 – Our Review\nAnd here are the top 10 trending searches in the world for games on Google in 2023: \nHogwarts Legacy\nThe Last of Us\nConnections\nBattlegrounds Mobile India\nStarfield\nBaldur's Gate 3\nスイカ ゲーム (a Japanese puzzle game known as Suika Game or Watermelon Game)\nDiablo IV\nAtomic Heart\nSons of the Forest\nDo any of these surprise you?

          "description": "The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.\nZau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.\n\nThe world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.\nSalim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.\nThe trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.",

These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nExoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). \nThe gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.\nCharacters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.\nExborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.",

Though it will feature plenty of action, it's described as a \"very Arkane game\", so fans should potentially expect it to have several of the studio's signature immersive sim hallmarks. \n\n\nMarvel's Blade has no release date or platform.",

The First Berserker: Khazan stands in stark contrast to the most recent entry in this universe, DNF Duel, a multiplayer fighting game released last year. \nNeople says the DNF series combines the fast-paced, higher-energy action of old-school brawlers with classic RPG elements, all wrapped in an anime-esque art style. However, with The First Berserker: Khazan, players can expect hack 'n' slash combat and plenty of customization. \nCheck it out for yourself in The First Berserker: Khazan reveal trailer below: \n\n\n\"The Pell Los Empire has been saved – at a cost,\" a press release reads. \"After the Great General Khazan and Archmage Ozma defeat the Berserk Dragon Hismar and the Dragon Legion, players will step into the shoes of Khazan as he is falsely accused of treason and exiled beyond the empire.\"\nNeople says in The First Berserker: Khazan, combat takes center stage in Khazan's quest for vengeance against those who orchestrated his downfall, \"marked by intense, aggressive, and ever-changing styles of battle.\" \nTo survive, players must master combat, upgrade character skills, and combine weapons and armor (each with unique perks). The more missions cleared, the tougher the bosses, but defeating them and finishing missions earns players powerful gear and abilities. \nThe First Berserker: Khazan will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. \nWhat do you think of The First Berserker: Khazan's reveal trailer?

But after years of secret development and repeated delays, it's finally around the corner, and The Game Awards just gave us our latest look. See for yourself in the trailer below:\n\n\nThe notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).\nLuckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.\nBut the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.",

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
