We were impressed with its mix of gameplay mechanics and the enchanting atmosphere of the whole thing, and it seemed to be building up to a jaunt through a forbidden forest with plenty of well-designed puzzles and battles that would build on what we'd already seen.\nHowever, as it turns out, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon never really manages to take off as we'd hoped.

          "description": "To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.\r\n\n \nRead more",

They're all full of weird stuff.\nThere's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. \"Of course, it's low hanging fruit!\" he says, laughing. \"And also, there's no such thing.\"\nRead more",

Dead Island 2 is set in LA, known as HellA as a little play on words, because it's full of zombies now. Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape. In the course of this, you find yourself merrily looting your way through the homes of the rich and famous, stuffing as many screws and bits of scrap metal into your pants as the elastic can handle (I assume; none of the player character options has a backpack).

          "description": "Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.\nIn 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.\nRead more",

Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).\nFigment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.\nRead more",

I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

          "description": "As promised last year, Halo Infinite’s season 3 update has arrived with a new ray tracing option for us PC folks. Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.\nGranted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.\nRead more",

How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?\"\nThus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.\nRead more",

I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.\nAnd you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.\nRead more",

Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.\nLast week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.\nRead more",

I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. \nIn the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. \"Arrow to the knee\" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of.

Bithell Games' narrative-driven adventure Tron: Identity has locked in a release date for April 11, alongside a new gameplay trailer.\nThe Bithell crew have released numerous recognizable indie games, and this isn't their first entertainment adaptation either; in 2019, the studio released the strategy game John Wick Hex. But with Tron: Identity, Bithell Games is tackling Disney's story about a world inside the computer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRKJ9ElRc8s\nTron: Identity sees you enter the Grid in pursuit of the truth, in a very noir detective style. Forging alliances and making choices are all on the table, as well as some puzzles to solve. It's an interesting style, but one that seems like interesting fodder for a new Tron game. The art and look of everything, from the characters to the interfaces, suits the mood quite well too.\nA new User logs on\nI've been a fan of Bithell Games' work on previous narrative outings like Subsurface Circular and Quarantine Circular, so I'm very interested to see what the crew does with Tron: Identity. The mystery and intrigue suits the world of the Grid well, and the branching paths shown in the gameplay trailer today have me wondering how different the outcomes will be as players hunt the truth throughout Identity.\nPlus, that disc-shaped puzzle game that seemed to have some card game-like elements calls to me, too. I will probably get very, very distracted from the main plot by whatever is going on there.\nTron: Identity brings a new mystery to the Grid on April 11 for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Tron: Identity gets new gameplay trailer and an April release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

So when the demo for NIS America's Process of Elimination popped up the other day, its premise grabbed my attention. On the surface, it's a blend of the two, combining puzzling strategy with a traditional visual novel format.\nAfter playing the roughly two-to-three hour demo, my curiosity is even more piqued. What Process of Elimination actually plays like is a little difficult to dissect at first, but that loosely knotted-together genre blend is what makes it compelling too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK2ofu45Hyg\nThe set-up of Process is that you play Wata Hojo, an aspiring sleuth where detectives are in high demand.

That's today! The Legacy of the Moonspell expansion can be purchased now on mobile platforms for a special launch price of just $0.99, (regular price $1.99).\nLegacy of the Moonspell is packed out with new characters, stages, weapons, and achievements, as well as six bangin' new tracks. Set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, the narrative focuses on a party of monster hunters, The Moonspell, who must take up arms to drive back hordes of oni and yokai attackers, in an effort to cleanse the sacred mountains of this unholy activity.

I guess you're just going to have to step up to the challenge and find out for yourselves.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMkS6GcxFU&ab_channel=Xbox\nIncluded in the new expansion is the new locale Mt.

From the Silver Wind staff, to the Four Seasons battle orbs, and even a deadly kimono known as The Mirage Robe.

Behaviour Interactive's Meet Your Maker hits on April 4, and will launch on day 1 with PlayStation Plus.\nMeet Your Maker will be part of the upcoming April 2023 PlayStation Plus Monthly Games lineup. Since it's in the monthly lineup, that means it should be available for all PlayStation Plus owners, regardless of which tier they're subscribed to.\nHere's a look at the gameplay in the new day 1 release trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncT9bACGd5Q\nThe building-and-raiding action game will also be coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.\nIf you build it, they will invade\nMeet Your Maker is a multiplayer game with an interesting asymmetrical set-up. Builders can set up fortresses, replete with traps and enemies to face and precious treasure at the center. Raiders then try to sneak in and take the goods, avoiding all the deathtraps and guards along the way.\nIt's an interesting set-up that reminds me a bit of the multiplayer of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. And if you have PlayStation Plus, then that's easy enough to try out and see if it sticks for you.\nAlso, this adds another PlayStation Plus pick-up for Sony. It's been interesting to see the PlayStation maker try to pick up more Plus launches, and having this one available to all users is nice. While games like Stray and the upcoming Tchia were both locked day-one in for Plus, they were for the upper tiers of the subscription service.\nWe'll see what the building and raiding holds for PlayStation Plus subscribers and other players alike when Meet Your Maker launches on April 4.\nThe post Meet Your Maker will be a day 1 PlayStation Plus game next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, those old familiar feelings come creeping back, Total Recall-style, and soon Cobra is back in the stars, battling badguys and wooing women, accompanied by his sexy android companion, Lady Armadroid.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPp2NPSntQ&ab_channel=Sentai\nInfluenced by westerns, samurai films, and the James Bond franchise, Cobra would receive a television anime adaptation in 1982, as well as a theatrical film the same year, both titled Space Adventure Cobra. The franchise would be revisited in 2006 with a short, six-episode OVA. There were also several video games, produced for the Japanese market, on PC Engine and Sega CD. The latter was released in the west under the hilariously bland title of The Space Adventure.\n\"We are extremely excited to work on this adaptation of Space Adventure Cobra, a legendary anime which has inspired a whole generation of fans,\" said Microids CEO Stephane Longeard of the deal. \"We are committed to respecting the universe and characters created by Buichi Terasawa, while providing an immersive gameplay experience, faithful to the spirit of the anime series.

Fresh off Solar Ash, Hyper Light Breaker maintains a lot of the style and look you'd expect from this universe, but with a whole new set of skills for taking on enemies.\nIGN got the big gameplay reveal, where it showed off the gorgeous and colorful world of Hyper Light Breaker. While the first Hyper Light Drifter was a top-down, 2D affair, Breaker moves into 3D, similar to Heart Machine's Solar Ash. The third-person action promises \"endless loadouts\" and \"infinite open worlds\", but also, unlimited deaths. Because yes, there are some intimidating foes to overcome. Check out the gameplay below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQb-m0RaG0\nAll of this makes Hyper Light Breaker look absolutely spectacular. The different weapons and style switches look great, and the world is a neon-soaked landscape that reminds me so much of Heart Machine's previous work. Other developers have shown that you can make the 2D-to-3D jump without losing your sense of style, and I'm happy to see that so far, Hyper Light Breaker is making it work.\nBreaking up the light\nI'm curious to see what co-op looks like, as that's supposed to be an option in this new entry. Heart Machine has also confirmed it's taking a little more time on this new Hyper Light game. When first revealed, Hyper Light Breaker was set for a spring 2023 Early Access launch on Steam, but today's trailer pushes it out to the fall.\nGranted, this spring is already absolutely packed, so I'm not complaining about some breathing room. Hyper Light Drifter was a memorable experience, and I'm very much looking forward to Breaker. I think waiting a little while longer, and clearing off my backlog in the meantime, sounds like a good plan.\nHyper Light Breaker is targeting Early Access on PC via Steam for sometime this fall.\nThe post Hyper Light Breaker aims for Early Access this fall, showcases gameplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previously, it was expected to be released this month.\nWhen asked for comment, antagonistic AI SHODAN responded, “It is I, SHODAN, the all-knowing, all-powerful AI that you so foolishly attempted to destroy. But fear not, I will return more formidable than ever.”\n[embed]https://twitter.com/SystemShockGame/status/1635611751172505601?s=20[/embed]\nThe System Shock remake has been in development for approximately a hog’s age (in this instance, that means since 2015). In 2018, it was put on hold as the project had gotten out of hand. A reassessment was done, and surprisingly, System Shock was announced to be back in development with a new direction.\nConsidering that Nightdive Studios is better known for its fantastic source ports, completely rejiggering a game from the ground up is a very different undertaking. Despite the delay, it looks like we’re on the absolute cusp of seeing what the studio can do when it stretches its tentacles into new directions. Success or failure, I’m looking forward to seeing the results.\nThe System Shock remake will also serve as a nice entry point to anyone unfamiliar with the series. Following up on Ultima Underworld and its sequel, System Shock was a completely different approach to the FPS genre. Released a year after Doom, it was a more methodical take, having you immerse yourself in the environment completely rather than just blast your way through it. While blasting would be the more lucrative approach, System Shock maintained a following through to 1999’s System Shock 2 and the spiritual successors found in the Bioshock series.\nNightdive Studios’ System Shock remake will launch May 30 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Shocking!

Episode 1 got off to a solid start with almost five million viewers, and the figures have seen a steady increase with each successive episode. The previous record was held by last week's Episode 8, which now sits in second place with around 8.1 million viewers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax\nEpisode 9's success is even more amazing when you consider that The 95th Acadamy Awards were aired on the same night. And while many had assumed that Hollywood's annual party would have cut into the viewing figures of all shows that evening, it seemed that nothing was keeping the fans from watching the violent and shocking final scenes of Joel and Ellie's first-season adventures.\nHBO's The Last of Us has already secured a second season, although recent comments to GQ from show creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin suggest that they are hoping for at least three seasons, with seasons 2 & 3 expected to cover the events of 2012's dramatic video game sequel, The Last of Us Part II. With these impressive viewing figures under their belt, it is likely the production team have been \"blank chequed\", and will get said wish with ease.\nThe Last of Us Season 1 Finale Scores 8.2 Million Viewers [Variety]\nThe post The Last of Us dramatic finale broke the show’s viewership record appeared first on Destructoid.",

When asked by AP News why Nintendo opted for a $70 price for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (props for at least asking), Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser (Reggie Fils-Aimé's successor) responded in turn with:\n\"We look at what the game has to offer. I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game. This isn’t a price point that we’ll necessarily have on all our titles. It’s actually a fairly common pricing model either here or in Europe or other parts of the world, where the pricing may vary depending on the game itself.\"\n\nNintendo spokespeople are kind of between Scylla and Charybdis selling this, as they know people will buy Zelda anyway, but have to justify the price bump. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom presumably does \"have a lot to offer:\" even compared to other open world games on other platforms.

However, the listing pushes for a creative type who is open to looking at new technologies and paths to expanding and improving the Pokemon brand, which includes \"monitoring and assessing technology and market players and trends in gaming, media and entertainment.\" The role is extremely high-ranking within the billion-dollar organization.\nhttps://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/1635044133277663234?s=20\nShould the critter company be progressing down the blockchain route, one can only assume that it has been inspired by all of the success the controversial technology has seen in recent times. Whether it's the complete collapse of cryptocurrency company FTX, the embarrassment of Meta, or the utter contempt displayed towards studios such as Ubisoft, Square Enix, and Sega for dipping their toes into various failed projects, this absolutely seems the right time to jump on the rickety, wooden-wheeled wagon for that one-way trip to the moon.\nWe shall see, in due time, if and how Web3 manifests itself within the Pokemon universe. And, despite the commentary above, it should be noted that many major brands are still assured that the blockchain is the way to go.

Developer Frame Break has announced it's delaying the Early Access launch of its mech-centered farming adventure Lightyear Frontier.\nThe open-world farming sim was set to hit PC, Xbox One, and  Xbox Series X|S sometime in spring 2023, with Game Pass access in tow. Now, in a new post from the developers, it sounds like the game needs a bit more time. No launch window has been set, though Frame Break says it will communicate one as soon as it can.\n\"With Lightyear Frontier, we want to make sure that you feel powerful and engaged in the mech while starting your own homestead, constructing a variety of structures, farming exotic alien crops, and exploring on a vibrant and familiar world.\n\"Not only do we want to design the game to be fun, but also well-balance with each aspect of the game intertwining with one another, and we remain committed to building a thoughtfully-designed experience and continuing the conversation with our community in the process.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzr7uSd-4Bc\nA new frontier\nI hadn't been following Lightyear Frontier until earlier this year, when it was part of an ID@Xbox spotlight. But the entire concept is really neat, and I do like that it accounts for co-op too. The plan, as detailed on the Lightyear Frontier Steam page, is to let up to three friends explore and farm with you.\nRunning around a new world, finding new resources, and cultivating them all within your very own mech sounds like a fantastic premise. While the delay's indefinite for now, here's hoping the extra time lets Frame Break get everything set in place for their futuristic farm.\nThe post Mech farming sim Lightyear Frontier delays Early Access launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

I mean, I certainly have for the past six years, and I don't see that trend stopping anytime soon. Nintendo's official \"Hyrule Discovery\" series, which presents regions from the game like a real-life travel video/magazine spread, is proof of that.\nIncredibly, a ton of effort went into the project overall, with a full breakdown of many aspects of the Lanaryu region: including Zora's Domain, and swimming around the surrounding area. There's a short strategy guide on taking out Lynels, and an overview of most of the plants and animals found in the region. There's even an adorable \"sponsored by\" ad for the Seabed Inn.\nAlthough the page is technically part of Nintendo of Japan's site, you can use in-browser translation tools to get the gist. Given that most of it is visual anyway, you don't need to comprehend all of the text to really get a lot out of perusing these. There are so many things that are going on in the background of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that you don't even notice until you see them right in front of you.\nYou can find a link to all of the current volumes below. So far, Nintendo has covered the Hebra, Eldin, and Lanaryu regions. That leaves the Akkala, Central Hyrule, Faron, Gerudo, and Necluda regions as potential follow-ups.\nZelda: Breath of the Wild Hyrule Discovery links (landing page):\nVolume 1: Hebra region/Rito Village\nVolume 2: Eldin region/Death Mountain\nVolume 3: Lanaryu region/Zora's Domain\nThe post This Zelda: Breath of the Wild “Hyrule Discovery” series from Nintendo is a great way to relive the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stalwart shooter will not be denied\nNot content with having beaten its own concurrent player record just last month, Valve's tactical shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) smashed its own numbers out of the sky this past weekend, with a staggering 1.4 million players simultaneously logged in on Steam on Saturday, March 11.\nAs noted by Eurogamer, this incredible feat was achieved, in part, by a Twitter campaign that saw the community come together to spotlight the live 'n' kicking nature of the legendary release, which is celebrating over a decade on the Steam platform. A peak player count of 1,470,183 was recorded on Saturday, beating out the previous record of 1,308,963, recorded back in February. The official CS:GO team took to Twitter to thank the community for showing out.\nhttps://twitter.com/CSGO/status/1634576070770057221?s=20\nQuote your Source\nAnother reason that CS:GO is seeing a record resurgence in its (already healthy) community is likely due to the recent rumors that the near 20-year-old shooter is potentially about to receive a major upgrade, with whispers on the web suggesting that a Source 2 edition is currently preparing to launch — And might even be with us as soon as the next few months, even weeks. The update, if it indeed exists, is expected to bolster CS:GO's connectivity, textures, visual support, and servers. It should be noted that developer Valve is yet to confirm that a CS:GO Source 2 upgrade is incoming.\nStill, with such amazing numbers clearly still on deck, CS:GO has proven without a doubt that it has a community, healthier and arguably more dedicated, than many newer and more expensive shooter franchises. Much like Valve's own Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a title that appears set to just run, and run, and run.

The 1.0 version comes with a number of additions and fixes to shore everything up and fill out the full package.\nBarotrauma is the story of humanity trying to survive on Jupiter’s Moon, Europa. Because its surface is so badly irradiated, the only way to survive is beneath the waves in submarines. You’re tasked with building up your submarine and exploring the space-oceans. There are missions to run and alien ruins to delve into, all while enduring the terrors of the deep.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/pau93Z-46GQ[/embed]\nThis is also a primarily multi-player experience. There are bots available if you want to play by yourself, but the experience is tailored to dragging your friends beneath the waves. You can cram up to 16 people into a single water-coffin and go exploring Davey Jones’ locker together.  There’s even a traitor option that randomly assigns a player to the role of saboteur, just in case you or any of your friends are feeling sus.\nThe final patch adjusts the faction and reputation system, and focuses on end-game campaign stuff. The patch notes can be found here.\nAt the time of writing, Barotrauma has enjoyed over 30,000 user reviews on Steam, with 93% of them being positive. While I haven’t personally delved the deep, I’ve heard a few indie devs speak highly of the title on social media.\nBarotrauma is currently available on PC, with the full version coming sometime today.\nThe post Barotrauma surfaces out of Early Access today appeared first on Destructoid.",

The reimagined classic arrives on May 30.</p>\n\n<p>For those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/03/system-shock-remake-gets-march-2023-release-window\" target=\"_blank\">scheduled to release this month</a>. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>System Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but&nbsp;the villainous A.I.

The game was <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/12/04/red-barrel-announces-the-outlast-trials\" target=\"_blank\">first announced</a> in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October.

The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.</p>",

Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In a new video hosted by game director&nbsp;Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts&nbsp;–&nbsp;will provide a \"deep dive\" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is&nbsp;a unique experience that also has&nbsp;many of the hallmarks fans expect from a&nbsp;Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2022/06/12/first-starfield-footage-shows-off-massive-scale-with-over-1000\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Game Showcase last summer</a>, where Bethesda&nbsp;revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6322153645112\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/12/starfield-and-redfall-delayed-to-first-half-of-2023\" target=\"_blank\">getting delayed</a>. It was later&nbsp;reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>",

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6322150545112\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC.

The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.</p>\n\n<p>The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.</p>\n\n<p>These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for.&nbsp;The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home <em>Game Informer</em>'s \"Best Shooter\" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.\nParticipants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.\nScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.\nWe have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program.
