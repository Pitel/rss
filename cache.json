This brain-bending puzzler deftly reinvents itself dozens of times over without deviating from its very simple, programmatic rules revolving around infinitude and recursion.\nChances are, you've heard of this premise before: push an object around a grid-like playing field and try to figure out how to navigate obstacles. Think along the lines of the puzzles you'd find in an icy cave in a Pokémon game. You have to plan every single move just right to get yourself, a box, or both, into the right spots. Chances are just as high, however, that you haven't seen the Patrick's Parabox's take on this puzzle. Instead of just pushing around a box to solve a puzzle, the game tasks you with navigating infinitely recurring boxes while also pushing boxes into place.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After years of silence, finally, in 2023, we have the game so we’ve fully got to grips with what's on offer, and it is definitely an interesting one. We’ve spent over a week with Pokémon Sleep, which includes a full week cycle of all of the mechanics.\nThe basics of Pokémon Sleep are quite simple; you just have to sleep. Each night you can load the game, enter sleep time and put the phone, or Pokémon GO Plus + on your bed in order for it to track your sleep through motion, and if using your phone, audio. The game does recommend you do this while charging your device, but you can track sleep without plugging it in as long as your phone has sufficient battery. If you record over 90 minutes of sleep, then your sleep session will be logged. The game doesn't reset the day until 4am as well so if you stay up late at night, it'll still count towards the previous day.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The first two sets of entries in its canon — Game Boy debuts Red and Blue, followed by sequels Gold and Silver — had cemented the series as one of the biggest of all time in gaming, defining millennial pop culture. With the arrival of Nintendo’s new handheld, the Game Boy Advance, Game Freak was poised to continue its dominance of the medium with the third generation of critters in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, which saw their European release on this day 20 years ago.\nHowever, it was also a time when the franchise was on a decline from its commercial heyday as the kids who had considered the first two generations as their bread and Butterfree had become uninterested teenagers. Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire still became best-selling titles on the GBA — with reported lifetime sales of over 16 million — but this was still a notable drop from the first two generations, which had surpassed 30 and 20 million, respectively, suggesting a waning of mainstream popularity. Those who were still on board, however, were offered a new adventure in the sunny, standalone region of Hoenn, which popped with 16-bit visual splendour, served up reinvigorated gameplay mechanics and introduced favourites like the meme-able Mudkip, Rayquaza and (sometimes for slightly more disturbing reasons) Gardevoir.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.\r\n\n\r\n“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.\r\n\n\r\n“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”\r\n \nRead more",

Getting everything in the right place. And something that makes it extra enjoyable in Unpacking is the sound design. The house itself is quiet, but everything in the game makes a little noise when you put it away or hang it up or slide it in a shelf, and it's all stuff you recognise from home. It makes the whole experience feel domestic and familiar.\nRead more",

As evidence, the action RPG slasher Wayfinder is entering early access on August 15th. The game has some faint MMO flavours and comes from developers Airship Syndicate (the studio behind Darksiders: Genesis and Battle Chaser: Nightwar) and publisher Digital Extremes (responsible for the long-running Warframe.) The game previously held various closed playtests, but now the metaphorical doors are being opened for more players.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So, in an evening spare of stuff to do, I booted the game up and created a druid called ANIMALS. After a few hours of pressing 1,3,2,4, in either the same pattern or different patterns, I've come to realise the game doesn't make me feel anything. I bash some skeletons, I equip a staff, I exit to Windows, I couldn't care less. Maybe, though, it's not such a bad thing?\nI know I said I'd like Diablo 4 to channel Vampire Survivors and give me an auto-attack switch, so I could just steer my character through encounters without having to think at all. I still stand by my stubbornness! But having obliterated more packs of rabid wolves and legions of demons, I've come to develop what I think is ARPG muscle memory.\nRead more",

The redundancies won’t take place immediately, according to CDPR, as some employees won’t lose their jobs until early next year at the latest.\r\n\n\r\n“There’s no easy way to say this, but today we are overstaffed,” said CEO Adam Kiciński in an ‘organisational update’ posted to the company’s website. “We have talented people on board who are finishing their tasks and — based on current and expected project needs — we already know we don’t have other opportunities for them in the next year,” he continued. \r\n\n\r\n“To meet our own high expectations and ambitions to create the best role-playing games, we not only want to have the best people but also the right teams,” says Kiciński. “What we mean by that is having teams that are built around our projects’ needs; teams that are more agile and more effective… After reshaping our development process and incorporating Agile methodologies, we’re now focusing on refining the shape of our teams.” Those projects in question include another Witcher trilogy, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and an all-new IP codenamed Project Hadar. That’s in addition to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 expansion called Phantom Liberty.  \r\n \nRead more",

But when there's a physical paper booklet that replicates all that for you in a much more easily accessible format, with several gorgeous illustrations of its mysterious space monastery to boot, not to mention infinitely better explanations of what everything does than I could ever hope to describe, it's quickly become an essential part of my play experience. \nI'm still working on my review for The Banished Vault (hopefully coming later this week), but as it launches on Steam today, I'd strongly recommend spending the extra £5/$5 to get one if you're at all interested in Lunar Division's space survival management 'em up.

And their answers gave us more of an insight into the game's early development, where the story might take you, and how you might overcome some of its trickiest nuts and bolts.\nWhile it won't come as much of a surprise to Armored Core veterans, Armored Core 6 isn't an open world game. If you're a new FromSoftware-liker brought on board by the expansive world of Elden Ring, then yes, you might be a bit surprised. As I mention in my preview, Armored Core 6 sees you play a mecha-mercenary who selects jobs from a drop down menu and jets off to destroy whatever needs destroying. But Yamamura says FromSoft actually considered going down a more open world route in early stages of the game's development.\nRead more",

I am furious because none of you told me Alan Wake is essentially Garth Marenghi in his Twin Peaks era, and if you had I would have played it ages ago. The game is such a knowing snake ball of mating tropes that it ouroboroses round into being brilliant, flawless, ridiculous. And also Alan is a terrible writer, I would hate his books.

          "description": "Three decades have gone by since the original Myst graced the world, providing endless online debates about whether it's smart or just pretentious. Magical or plain bad. Some indie developers chose the latter with a Myst FPS remix that spoofed the senior adventure game. The RPS readership seemed split on the subject when we asked \"Have You Played Myst?\" years ago. But Humble Games leans toward the former as it’s choosing to celebrate the classic's whopping 30th birthday with a returning charity bundle, available now until August 3rd.\r\n\n\r\nThe Humble Myst & More Bundle packages the titular point-and-clicker, alongside several other sequels, spiritual successors, and odd offshoots from developer Cyan Worlds. You can pay anything over £7.80/$10 for the 11-game bundle, or you can pay at least £15.60/$20 to also grab the Myst remake from 2021. \r\n\n\r\nCyan Worlds loves a good re-release, and this latest bundle is a reminder of how many Mysts have Mysted over the years. There’s Myst: Masterpiece Edition which remasters the music and imagery, and is otherwise as close to the original as you can get. Then there’s realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which added changing weather, day-night cycles, free roam movement, and a bonus epilogue. And finally, there’s the most recent pretty remake that’s also compatible with VR.\r\n \nRead more",

The fast-paced, swashbuckling fights are endless fun, and the sun-kissed towns were a treat for the eyes, but it was honestly swoon at first sight when I first saw Adalia de Volador.\nWhat can I say, folks? I'm in love. Let me list everything I adore about Adalia like this is my high school diary. She’s an amazing sword fighter; her acrobatic and graceful nature lets her outwit anyone who crosses her blade. She’s got panache, cheek, and a sharp wit to boot. And speaking of - her boots! Her hat! Her cape! She’s got endless style! And when she punts a soldier off a dock ledge and into the sea, my heart skips a beat.\nRead more",

Or maybe because they just ended really damn well. Whatever the reasoning, join us as we ponder our favourite games that we’ve never returned to.\r\n\n\r\nPlus!

The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. \r\n\n\r\nThis comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.\r\n\n\r\nThe Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks. \r\n \nRead more",

You'll rewind and fast forward time to plot suspicious movements, track stolen objects as they move across town, and work out who (or what) is causing all this chaos.

Heavy hitters such as Disney Dreamlight Valley and the newest Bus Simulator are enjoying nice discounts, but as always, some hidden gems require a little bit of scrolling. The sales last until July 24th, so here are some good old recommendations from the event.\r\n\n\r\nSurprise! Lakeburg Legacies is a hybrid between village management and mediaeval matchmaking , and it’s out now with a 15% sale bringing the price down to £16.50/$19.50. Love is almost as hard-to-manage as the economy, but worry not, a soothing storybook aesthetic should make this one slightly less stressful than couple’s therapy and/or mayoral duties. \r\n\n\r\nWobbly person sim Human: Fall Flat has a hefty 70% discount and is currently £4.80/$6.50. To celebrate the puzzle-platformer’s seventh anniversary, the team are also sharing some mysterious news tomorrow. That’s in addition to a new level coming in August, so look forward to more clumsy flailing.\r\n \nRead more",

I found it hard because any time I boot it up, I can get lost for hours just playing it. Not trying to win, not following the story, not looking for (ugh) \"progression\". Just mining, exploring, idly drifting through the void. It is a game I don't want to exhaust because I'm enjoying it too much. I went back in \"for a quick dive\" twice during this intro.\nIt doesn't have Content. It's not one of those compulsive, manipulative forever games. You could barge efficiently through it, finding probably all its secrets and items as fast as possible. That wouldn't be wrong, exactly, but it's missing the point: this is a game to be savoured, not consumed.\nRead more",

Starting today, The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are both free to keep from the digital store. Something for multiplayer dragon slayers and solo picross lovers alike. \r\n\n \r\nThe Elder Scrolls Online is, well, The Elder Scrolls but online. The long-running MMO has been unlocking doors into every corner of Tamriel, most recently with the Necrom expansion’s otherworldly tentacles and massive mushrooms. It's good at accommodating solo players who are looking to scratch a Skyrim-sized itch - since the next Elder Scrolls is at least five years away. That approachability got the game into our list of the ten best MMOs on PC. \r\n\n\r\nOn the other end of the humanities versus maths spectrum, we have Murder By Numbers, a murder mystery visual novel where you complete picross puzzles to further the investigation. Plus there's a robo-friend who pulls out a monocle every now and then, which is just plain cute. AliceB said the game was “worth a poke around if you’re a fan of either genre involved,” in our Murder By Numbers review. Even though neither half “are given enough space to breathe,” it should be worth a try for the affordable price of zero pence, though. \r\n \nRead more",

Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!\". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.\nBut the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.\nRead more",

Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love.

I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?\nRead more",

Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. \nYou see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Unpacking is, for the most part, a laid-back puzzle game. I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.\nA big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst. Spoilers ahead for those who have not played Unpacking.\nRead more",

The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. \nFull Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.\nRead more",

The EPYC 9684X delivers terrific generational uplift compared to Milan-X, offers significant advantages over the EPYC 9004 Genoa processors thanks to the 1.1GB of L3 cache per CPU that proves very beneficial in HPC and AI workloads, and the 96-core / AVX-512 / 3D V-Cache combination far surpassed the Intel performance in the vast majority of benchmarks. As some follow-up benchmarks, today is looking precisely at the performance difference caused by the 3D V-Cache presence by looking at the EPYC 9684X performance when the 3D V-Cache feature was enabled and then the tests repeated when disabled.",

We've already encountered enough mods for the remake, so it's nice to see the 2005 version of Resident Evil 4 still getting some love in 2D form.\nThis one comes courtesy of DooMero over on Doomworld (spotted by PCGamesN), and is essentially a sort-of \"demake\" of Resident Evil 4 which turns the third-person horror title into a 2D shooter.\nhttps://youtu.be/pJcanNT5iQg\nA recent video uploaded to the modder's YouTube channel shows 30-minutes of action from the project. Indeed, we get to see Leon Kennedy, as he was in the original RE4, making his way through the village in glorious side-scrolling action. The twist here is that it's being created in the Doom engine; GZDoom to be precise.\nSo when do we get to play it?\nAt the moment, there doesn't appear to be any release date for what's being called Resident Evil 4 2D. DooMero says they've been working on the mod since 2016, but had to take a break. All we can really say is that a demo is hopefully coming soon. We just don't know when.\nIt's pretty impressive to see something like RE4 being recreated in Doom. It kind of goes to show just how versatile the latter continues to be, not to mention how creative the modding community can get.\nIt's a bit of a new take on what many would consider to be the best Resident Evil game ever. Admittedly, going to 2D side-scrolling does give it an antiquated kind of charm, but it's just one more way we can admire Leon's golden bangs.\nThe post Here’s Resident Evil 4 reimagined as a 2D side-scroller in the Doom engine appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Given that it was one of the most popular shows on TV back in its prime, it's not surprising there have been a number of video game adaptations of The Simpsons.\nSome have been less than impactful, while others have been downright abysmal. However, one that tends to get mentioned (even these days) is Simpsons: Hit & Run, the collective of open world adventures of the titular yellow characters that parodied the likes of GTA.\nhttps://youtu.be/AHAY-teQoFc\nNow, it's made a comeback. Sort of. That is to say that someone has managed to remake Hit & Run entirely in Unreal Engine 5. Taking a year to complete, developer reubs has now finally managed to do a full recreation from scratch of the iconic 2003 Simpsons game.\nNot for public consumption\nSadly, reubs says he won't be making his UE5 version available for all to play, stating clearly that this is not a downloadable mod. However, we do get to see the first 30-minutes of this unofficial remake.\nThere's plenty of content that the developer goes through, showing us the new graphics (with artwork done by technical artist korylonplay) and the new cutscenes. It still has that Simpsons: Hit & Run charm that Radical Entertainment gave us 20 years ago. It just looks more up-to-date.\nFor those who remember playing the original, it's a little trip down memory lane. Okay, so we can't play it, which kind of sucks, but you can imagine the litigation that would have to be traversed to get a remake approved by Disney (which now owns the franchise).\nSimpsons writer and joint showrunner Matt Selman has expressed interest in seeing the game get remade, but describes the \"complicated corporate octopus to try to make that happen.\" Given that, reubs' proof-of-concept is probably the closest we'll ever get to a modern take on Hit & Run.\nThe post Simpsons: Hit & Run gets a fan remake, but you can’t play it unfortunately appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In the last few years, Sony has been steadily porting its hit AAA titles to PC. Though most ports, such as God of War (2018) and Horizon Forbidden West, have been successful, others, like The Last of Us Part 1, have been poorly received. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the next title up for a PC port, and Insomniac has confirmed that it is Steam Deck Verified.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393569\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart hits PCs\nRift Apart was initially released in 2021 as one of the PS5's flagship titles. It caught the attention of PlayStation players worldwide thanks to its dimensional rifts that allow players to jump between environments instantly.\nPC players will get to experience Ratchet and Rivet's adventure soon, as the game is set to launch on the platform on 26 July. Initially, many believed that the port would require a beefy PC with a zippy SSD. Though you will need a reasonably specced PC to play Rift Apart, it will run just fine on hard disc drives (HDDs) at minimum settings.\nhttps://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1683953133825716224\nRift Apart is Steam Deck Verified, meaning the portable gaming device can handle it. Though some variations of the Steam Deck have SSDs, players have to settle for lowered settings on the handheld, as has been the case with previous Sony ports. Those on high-spec PCs get to enjoy 4K 60FPS ray-traced gameplay.\nThis isn't the first time Insomniac has ported its titles to PC, as Spider-Man Remastered was ported to PC in 2022 (with help from fellow first-party studio Nixxes Software). The web-slinging game is also Steam Deck Verified.\nRift Apart is a visually stunning title that does a phenomenal job of presenting a truly next-gen experience. Though some may feel that it is a little pricey for its short length, it is packed with non-stop excitement.\nThe post Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is Steam Deck Verified appeared first on Destructoid.",

This year has been a good one for the company, with titles such as Resident Evil 4 Remake and Street Fighter 6 releasing to critical acclaim. Capcom’s most recent quarterly report revealed the company’s bestselling franchises, and there aren’t many surprises.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393594\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nCapcom franchises continue to thrive - here are the top five as of July 2023\nAs a surprise to nobody, Resident Evil tops the list, with 146 million units sold in the franchise's entire lifetime. This number has been boosted by Resident Evil 4 Remake, which has sold 5 million units as of July 2023.\nOther titles in the series also continue to sell well, with Resident Evil 2 Remake surpassing 12 million units sold. Fans of the franchise can look forward to RE4 Remake’s VR mode which is in development.\nThe rest of the list looks like this:\n2. Monster Hunter - 94 million units\nStreet Fighter - 52 million units\nMega Man - 40 million units\nDevil May Cry - 29 million units\nDragon’s Dogma - 7.7 million units\nMonster Hunter’s lifetime sales are to be expected, as the report also reveals that Monster Hunter Rise has sold over 13 million units, with Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak selling over 6 million units. Street Fighter 6, the latest entry in the series, launched in June and has already sold over 2 million units.\nPlenty of upcoming Capcom titles will ensure those sales numbers stay high. This includes Dragon’s Dogma 2 and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy.

          "description": "Did you have trouble getting into Max Payne 3’s melancholic bullet-time extravaganza but couldn’t put your finger on why? I’ll tell you: it’s because the eponymous pouty-pants wasn’t wearing the face of Sam Lake, the original face model for Max Payne. Now’s your chance to finally get immersed in the dour, gritty spectacle with a new mod that transforms Max’s face back to the way the Gods of Visage intended.\nThe mod comes to use from Nexus user Alexsavvy. It’s no hack job either, as Max’s goes through a lot of abuse throughout the game. Alexsavvy has made sure that every scrape, bump, and misplaced strand of hair still reflects on the hero’s mug. Meanwhile, the distinct nonplussed look of the New York detective stays in place while he’s still able to move and show the full range of emotions that the original Max model did.\nhttps://youtu.be/qAoKMhw5QmM\nIt goes even beyond that, as the burly physique of Max has been paired down, and all of his clothes have been altered to fit. To give a better idea of the changes, here’s what Alexsavvy had to say in their own words.\n“In total, the mod replaces 98 models and 66 textures. Plus, models and textures in the mirror for the scene where Max shaves his head. Yes, you will see how Sam Lake shaves his head!”\nIt looks great, and I am tempted to give the game another playthrough just to check this mod out in closer detail. Sam Lake probably didn’t give permission for the use of his face, but knowing the guy (not personally), I imagine he’d be flattered. Oh, as it turns out, he just might be.\nhttps://twitter.com/SamLakeRMD/status/1683864006233137152?s=20\nYou can grab the Sam Lake mod over here on Nexus.\nThe post Max Payne 3 mod puts Sam Lake’s face back where it belongs appeared first on Destructoid.",

Afterdream will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime this year.\nThe spooky title is in development by sole developer Jesse Makkonen. Makkonen is well known for his other 2D scary titles Heal, Distraint, and Distraint 2. Afterdream is also coming to PC via Steam, through publisher Gamera Games.\nTo celebrate the news, Feardemic also released a creepy console reveal trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opqd5ri1_cM\nExplore lucid dreams with a spooky camera\nVisually, Afterdream looks great, with eerily creepy 2D stylized pixel art. Players use a special camera to navigate a ghastly mansion that blurs the line between reality and lucid dreaming. The camera will allow you to interact with hidden objects only visible through the lens of the camera.\nI love the atmosphere of Afterdream.  It's hard to pull off a scary game using pixel art, but Makkonen definitely knows what he's doing. Also, with it being somewhat of a side-scroller, Afterdream seems honestly perfect for consoles. I'm curious to see where the story can go with this one, because I know his former games left quite an impact.\nAfterdream will release sometime in 2023 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Psychological horror game Afterdream is coming to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bethesda is making up for the radio silence that engulfed much of Starfield's development by turning on the hype machine. It has just released The Settled Systems, a compilation of three Starfield animated shorts that show the game's universe.\nFirst, there's Supra et Ultra, which is Latin for \"Above and Beyond\". It shows a bit of the life of a pilot who goes to New Atlantis to enlist in the Vanguard, The United Colonies' military faction. This naturally provides a good excuse to show off a neat little space battle. The animation feels a bit bare-bones at times, with a segment that barely even features any coloring, but that's clearly a stylistic choice and it looks nice overall.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kj6wulHMsA\nThen there's Where Hope Is Built. It's a cute little short about a teen left orphaned by the war who saves an old man and ends up getting much-needed help in return. It's a bit formulaic, but it does a good job of reassuring players that yes, there will be side quests.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9trjxvaWP_0\nLastly, there's The Hand That Feeds. It shows a Neon City scoundrel having a fallout with her partner following a change of heart while robbing an employee of Ryuijin Industries, a mega-corporation from the planet Volii Alpha. The whole thing culminates with her getting a job at her would-be victim's megacorp. This is probably the most interesting of the bunch, as it hints that simple situations can have various possible outcomes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mX2iDI00FM\nWe still don't know if any of these characters will show up in the game. We also don't know whether we'll be seeing more episodes of The Settled Systems. Either way, we doubt these are the last promos we'll see from Starfield.\nBethesda will likely keep the hype machine in high gear until Starfield launches on September 6, 2023, on Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Starfield gets some animated shorts building out the upcoming RPG’s galaxy appeared first on Destructoid.",

It didn't look popular based on early reports, especially as it seemed to be underperforming when compared to its 8GB variant.\nNow it looks like you can already grab this card below its Recommended Retail Price (RRP), at least in Germany. According to a report from Hardware.info (as spotted by PCGamesN), the MSI Ventus 3X model of the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB has already been dropped to €519, which is about $573 US according to XE.com.\nThe report goes on to say that this is $40 less than the asking price, and the damn thing only came out a few days ago.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393471\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nvidia[/caption]\nNvidia's embarrassment\nGiven the benchmark test mentioned above, the early discount isn't terribly surprising. Even Nvidia's board partners weren't excited about the 16GB version of the 4060 Ti. This isn't a worldwide price drop, but it suggests that Team Green's newest card could go cheaper elsewhere.\nHonestly, I'd forgive you for not even knowing the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB was even out. Its launch hasn't result in much fanfare. Critics already felt sour on the $100 price increase compared to the 8GB model, especially considering the only difference between models is VRAM.\nIn any case, if you want the 16GB version, you may want to hold off for now.

It takes place on the planet of Shoal, where the wildlife isn’t too happy that their habitat is being fought over. The game was pitched to me as Advance Wars meets Dune, and I can see it. But beyond the turn-based skirmishes, there’s also some base-building and exploration to be had.\nhttps://youtu.be/vxyfRxWUQX4\nI haven’t had the chance to try Cantata, but it looks pretty incredible. The bizarre neon art design is a great foundational aesthetic, but the gameplay looks expansive and tight. It’s somewhat hard to find a game that manages to capture mechanical depth and aesthetic splendor. Since I haven’t wrapped my filthy mitts around it, I can’t say for sure it’s successful, but all this evidence is pointing to yes.\nIt’s an unholy marriage of tactical skirmishes and grand strategy. Also, there’s a map editor and multiplayer for people who like to confound their friends.\nCantata is currently available on Steam Early Access.

          "description": "It's gratifying to know that the FPS genre is still going strong. However, these whippersnappers wouldn't be anywhere without the granddaddy of all shooters that is the original Doom from 1993. The following year saw the release of a sequel, Doom II, which was equally impactful. So much so that people are still making mods for the game.\nThis one from Cheello is rather special indeed. While it's not out yet, their Voxel Doom 2 project is just around the corner. It may not look like much at a cursory glance, but it'll bring a more modern element to the iconic game without losing that original spark.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQK8m41daAk\nAs the name suggests, this upcoming mod will implement 3D voxels into Doom 2. Specifically, enemies, weapons, and items are being swapped out for three-dimensional models. A recent trailer (with a kickass soundtrack to boot) shows that it's going to be releasing on August 1. You can also check out some additional content on Cheello's Twitter, as well as support them via their Patreon page.\nThe legacy continues\nLook, if you've played Doom, chances are you've come across some mods in the past. Even if you haven't played any of them, you can appreciate that a series almost 30 years old still getting love and attention is quite something.\nWith the recent Myhouse.wad map craze, not to mention scientists now looking to grow neurons that could potentially play Doom, id Software's iconic FPS is a legendary part of video game history.\nNo matter which Doom you think is the best, the franchise will stay in the limelight so long as people like Cheello continue to tweak the formula and improve on the OG releases.\nThe post Doom 2 will be getting a 3D voxel mod in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sabotage Studio has revealed that the upcoming retro-inspired RPG Sea of Stars will be available as a PlayStation Plus Game Catalog title on day one of its release. The official release date for the pixel RPG is August 29. By joining the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, all PS+ Extra and Premium members will get full access to the game on launch day.\nIf the visuals remind you of a lot of old-school SNES RPGs don't worry, that's intentional. Sea of Stars is technically a prequel to 2D action platformer The Messenger, which was also created by Sabotage Studio. We gave The Messenger a flawless 10/10 when it was released back in 2018.\nThe list of games coming to PlayStation Plus for August has not been released, though I expect it will soon. The free games are added on the first Tuesday of the month which for August is actually August 1. With Sea of Stars coming to the catalog, August will already be a great one for PS+ members.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393464\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Sabotage Studio[/caption]\nDemo available now on PS4 and PS5\nA demo for Sea of Stars was also released on PS4 and PS5 today. Sabotage Studio made sure to point out that while the areas in the demo will be in the final game, the exact slice of the demo does not reveal any major spoilers from the main story. The demo highlights some gameplay systems and the mechanics around dungeon crawling and combat. And, while there are no major story spoilers, it does provide a sense of tone and vibe.\nThe beautiful pixel RPG looks reminds me a lot of Chained Echoes. Our very own Eric Van Allen called Chained Echoes a surprise RPG hit when it was released late last year. It's possible Sea of Stars could share a similar fate when it releases next month.\nSea of Stars releases on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on August 29.\nThe post Sea of Stars will be on PlayStation Plus day one appeared first on Destructoid.",

And with even games like Elden Ring seeing big popularity on the portable PC platform, it's an obvious question as to whether FromSoftware's next title Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon will also be Steam Deck compliant.\nWe got the chance to play Armored Core VI in a recent hands-on preview and chat with two of the team's leads, director Masaru Yamamura and producer Yasunori Ogura. During the roundtable interview, the pair were asked about the prospects of Armored Core VI on the Steam Deck.\n\"Obviously, seeing how Elden Ring performed on Steam Deck, we're very happy, and we wanted to at least create that as a baseline going forward for this handheld,\" said Ogura. \"So it is f…",

          "description": "There came a point, in playing Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, that I determined I simply wasn’t going fast enough. By this point in my hands-on time, I had overcome plenty of enemy mechs, from simple cannon-fodder to named adversaries with callsigns. I was already a heavy-metal death machine. But I could be faster; not just in raw speed, but turning, target acquisition, and elimination. I could push this steel body faster than I currently was, faster than I probably should.\nSo I went into the garage and fine-tuned my machine. In battle, I practiced using my minimap and scan functions to see things my eyes, with one focal point, couldn’t. Heck, I cranked my camera sensitivity to the highest sensitivity it would go so I could pivot faster. If any of that sounds appealing to you, then Arm…",

Although the shake-up could lead to studios receiving the capital they need to execute more ambitious ideas, it also comes at the risk of creating anti-competitive monopolies.\nTechland is one of the latest studios to make headlines, as it has recently been revealed that Tencent is in the process of becoming a majority stakeholder in the studio.\n[caption id=\"attachment_372659\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Techland[/caption]\nTencent and Techland\nFounded in 1991, Techland is a Polish studio most known for the first-person survival horror franchise Dying Light. On July 24, the studio announced that Tencent is in the process of becoming a majority stakeholder in Techland. This move was motivated by the belief that \"the best, boldest dreams can only be achieved while working side-by-side with like-minded friends and strong partners\".\nAlthough it is a big step for Techland, the studio has assured players that it still has its sight on making Dying Light the \"ultimate zombie game experience for players worldwide\". Furthermore, Paweł Marchewka will continue to serve as CEO.\nTencent, a massive Chinese tech and entertainment conglomerate, has its fingers in quite a few pies. In addition to its 40% stake in Fortnite's Epic Games, it also has a 100% stake in Back 4 Blood's Turtle Rock Studios and a 9.99% stake in Ubisoft, to name but a few of its foreign investments.\nMicrosoft has also been growing its stable of gaming studios, with the Activision Blizzard acquisition having been recently approved by the European Union.

You might remember it from my blockbuster article, “Here are eleven 2022 indie games to look forward to.” It’s now the middle of (checks watch) 2023, and it has finally arrived.\nTime Bandit is the story of having a crappy job and working for the man. In this case, however, the man is exploiting workers and using them to gather time crystals for potentially nefarious purposes.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ug4Uokxc1F0\nBut slow down there since Time Bandit also runs on a real-time clock. Sort of like Pokemon Gold/Silver! Your shift is based on real-world time, and different tasks take different amounts of time. Sometimes you even need to meet characters at a specific time of day that they’ll schedule with you in advance. You’d going to need to rein in that spontaneity if you want to overthrow your capitalist overlords.\nI was hoping to get a review of Time Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine up at launch, but ironically, I just haven’t had the time. Hopefully, I can circle back to it because I really enjoyed the build that I played last year. I also provided feedback directly to Joel, so I’m eager to see if any of it was incorporated. It’s like I have skin in the game when, in reality, I’m not really much different than any normal commenter.\nTime Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine is available on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io starting today.\nThe post Indie embezzlement game Time Bandit releases today on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Indie studio Universal Happymaker announced their management adventure Astronaut: The Best will release for PC via Steam on August 15. In Astronaut, players have the task of managing an occult space academy in an uncanny world.\n\"Our team spent over eight years working to make a bizarre moral laboratory of a game, that feels truly unlike anything you've played before,\" said Mike Sennott, Lead Developer on Astronaut: The Best. \"We hope you'll be deeply and delightedly surprised by what you find inside, and that makes all those years worth it.\"\nSennott was the Narrative Designer on the popular indie tactical RPG Wintermoor Tactics Club. The team also released a new launch date announcement trailer showing off Astronaut's weirdness.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbkPomZBxyE\nRunning a culty space academy doesn't look easy\nIn Astronaut: The Best, it's literally your job to guide procedurally generated misfit recruits through a roguelite hodgepodge of scandals and challenges. You can guide your Astronaut team via a variety of methods including lies, witchcraft, and of course some good ole classic hard work. New recruits can be former serial killers, part-time pirates, or even members of the royal family. The team at Universal Happymaker notes that choices will actually have an impact on each recruit as well as their likelihood to succeed.\nThis game is definitely very weird looking, which has really piqued my interest. It's weird looking in an intriguing way. The visuals are uncanny for sure and in some aspects eerily creepy. It's sort of giving me Cultist Simulator vibes with a bit of Homestar Runner between the graphic and comedic style. I'm interested to see just how strange the game can get.\nAstronaut: The Best releases on PC via Steam on August 15. It is also Steam Deck compatible.\nThe post Weird occult management game Astronaut: The Best blasts off August 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can now nab it there for the price of free.\nI’ve covered He Fucked the Girl Out of Me a couple of times now, but it was something that burrowed under my skin and has lived there since. Being a semi-autobiographical retelling of a slew of problematic topics such as sex work, getting it on Steam is no small matter. For one thing, it gets lumped in with all the 18+ games that have names like Sex Campus Story. I mean sure, minors should probably not play either one, but one has clearly different goals.\nWhile the game is free, there are a few donation options presented as DLC, which I think is kind of neat. Beyond simple game design, Taylor does quite a bit to help the queer game development community.\nAgain, however, I’d like to be clear in saying that you should be careful playing He Fucked the Girl Out of Me and definitely pay attention to the content warnings. Not everyone is going to have such a visceral reaction to the subject matter, but some will. I’d hate for someone to think they are just going to be playing a neat Game Boy Color game and walk away with vicarious trauma.\nYou’ve been warned, but if you still feel like checking out He Fucked the Girl Out of Me, you can get it now on Steam.\nThe post Trauma art game He F—ed the Girl Out of Me releases on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Paramount Pictures and Xbox are teaming up to give you a chance to get your hands on exactly what you've been looking for: a pizza-scented Xbox controller. The cheesy (hehe) event is to celebrate the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that releases on August 2.\nThe Xbox Wireless Controllers come with a built-in scent diffuser shaped like a pizza slice. There's a controller variation for each of the Turtle brothers: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michaelangelo. The announcement provided no details on the type of pizza we can smell from the controller. I mean, what exactly are we talking about here? Just cheese? Pepperoni? An aromatic supreme pie? Just say it isn't pineapple.\nThose who need help getting hungry for a pizza while they game can enter to win one of the controllers pretty easily. Simply follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter and retweet the official Xbox Game Pass sweepstakes tweet. The giveaway starts on July 24 and lasts through August 13. You can find the full list of rules and eligibility details here.\nhttps://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1683492348234199041\nCowabunga, dude!\nThe controllers themselves have pretty cool TMNT-themed skins, but the \"pizza diffuser\" looks a bit off. It kind of looks like one of those plastic doggy squeak toys. This is obviously very gimmicky but I guess it could be cool getting a whiff of pizza-y goodness while playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.\nAlso part of the event is a new TMNT DLC for Minecraft. The turtles-themed DLC allows you to play as any of the four turtles and explore iconic locations such as the Turtle Lair and fight baddies like Krang.\nIf you're not confident you will win one of these limited controllers, there's still a chance to smell the 'za. Gamers in the NYC area can head over to the Xbox Gaming Lounge at the Microsoft Experience Center on Fifth Avenue and sniff the controllers from 4-7 p.m. EST on August 2.\nThe post You can win a…TMNT pizza-scented Xbox controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ludicrously late notice\nApogee, Nightdive, and New Blood have announced that the console version of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition will be delayed on console. No date has been given for when we can expect the game to hit Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, but the PC version is still expected to drop on July 31, 2023.\nRise of the Triad was first released back in 1994 for DOS. It was a pretty ballsy move to release a game built on the Wolfenstein 3D engine after Doom took the forefront of first-person shooters in 1993. To be certain, Rise of the Triad really doesn’t stack up to the monolith it was competing against. But whenever I hear stories of its development, it sounds like Tom Hall and his team had fun creating it.\nhttps://youtu.be/vRdZEY6EL5I\nThat shows in its actual gameplay. What it lacks in fancy technical tricks, it makes up for in its ridiculous design. There are Nazi-esque soldiers begging for their life or playing dead and heat seeking missiles that home in on torches. There are a lot of fun touches that make for a really memorable experience.\nThis is pure speculation, but I wonder if the delay is due to the inclusion of Return of the Triad. This was a fan-made sequel created in the GZDoom Engine. If they wanted to include it in the console versions, they’d have to either port it into the KEX Engine or run it under GZDoom. I’m not sure how simple that is to do in terms of both development and licensing. It’s a worthwhile inclusion, though, as it’s a fantastic little offshoot.\nRise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition launches on PC on July 31, 2023. The console versions will follow later this year.\nThe post Console versions of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Gone are the days of elaborate statues for physical rewards, and annual loyalty bonuses (which, most of the time, ruled!). That said, My Nintendo does surprise us from time to time, and lately, they've been cooking up a ton of rewards to coincide with the summer release calendar. With all of the Zelda, Kirby, and Pikmin rewards on the My Nintendo marketplace at the moment, I figured it was worth reminding people that yes: your points do expire. Here's how to do a quick scan and see when everything will fall off.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393208\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nHow to check when your My Nintendo points are expiring\nHead to the My Nintendo website\nScroll all the way down to the bottom of the page and click on the \"point summary\" link\nAt the top of the screen, look for the \"points expiration\" link and click that\nFrom there, you'll be able to see an itemized rolling total of when all of your points are going to expire month-to-month. That includes Platinum points, as well as individualized mobile game points.\nThis is an important screen to check every so often (I just did it and splurged on the new Pikmin rewards!), as you'll want to dump points into rewards if they're going to expire at the end of the month anyway. It's a sneaky way for Nintendo to create point churn, and prevent folks from just playing through Fire Emblem Heroes, amassing thousands of points, and saving them for big-ticket rewards.\nThe post PSA: A lot of My Nintendo rewards are active, so make sure you check when your points expire appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.\nA PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. \nSea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  \nSea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game. We also have a video interview with creative director Thierry Boulanger breaking down Sea of Stars’ RPG inspirations.",

He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nThis is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others. \n For more on Techland, you can check out this piece of concept art from their new fantasy IP as well as our Dying Light 2 Stay Human review.",

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. \nDespite the \"VI\" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or \"Raven\" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. \n\n\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.\nThe five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.\n\n\nThe video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. \nAtlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. \nEnjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nUbisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. \nIn our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. \nFor more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. \nThe Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.\nAre you excited for The Crew Motorfest?

This new subscription tier of Xbox Game Pass will cost $9.99 per month, or $59.99 a year, and serves as an evolution of Xbox Live Gold, according to the company.\n\n\n“Game Pass Core will give players access to our advanced multiplayer network, a select collection of over 25 games to play with friends around the w…",

As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. \n\n\nHere’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: \nFor the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. \nThese songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.\nStray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023. \nWill you check out Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical next month?

That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.\nFor any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).\nThe actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. \n\n\nWayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. \nClock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.",

Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. \nEnjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nIn 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a \"rising tides raise all ships\" scenario. \nAfter playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. \nRa Ra Boom hits PC early next year.\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024. \nAre you going to check out Ra Ra Boom later this year?

The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. \nThe game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  \n\n\nBanishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.",

And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

          "description": "This post is part of a two-part series, of which this is the second. In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!",
