AAA publishers roll out the same full-price titles year-on-year with fewer improvements and added pay-to-win incentives, all bundled up in a package that is regularly less-than-optimal on Switch. Fortunately, in the darkest of days, the indie scene is there to illuminate us.\nIn recent years, the Switch eShop has blossomed with indie sports titles, offering a different experience to the big leagues of FIFA EA Sports FC or NBA 2K by instead focusing on the fun of the game. Deep in the mix of the sports genre's arcade rebirth is New Star Games, a team determined to bring an accessible twist to an often mechanic-filled playing field.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. \nNow though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!  \nRead more",

Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase \"that's a cute observation, Edwin\". But the word originally evolved from \"acute\", which very broadly means sharp or intense. \"Acute\" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to \"ague\", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word \"cute\", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called \"cute aggression\" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - \"I just want to squeeze you till you pop\".\n Read more",

I mean, why waste them when you're a young telekinetic hellbent on getting your revenge on the cult that raised you and held you hostage for your entire life? One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.\nRead more",

          "description": "A great 3D platformer seems to be a rare and special thing these days. I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.\nSo where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.\nRead more",

It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build.

For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.   \nRead more",

          "description": "Inflexion Games have announced accessibility options for Nightingale, the Victorian \"gaslamp fantasy\" survival game in which you wander the Fae Realms in bowler hat and ballgown, building houses and murdering eldritch wildlife. Among the wildlife you'll murder are giant spiders, which might be a dealbreaker for some people, so it's just as well Nightingale comes with an arachnophobia mode which transforms those spiders into... large, winged balloons with teeth. It also replaces decorative, non-interactive, smaller spiders and scorpions found in the game's environments with ant models. If you have a phobia for ants or menacing balloons, you're out of luck, I guess. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.\nAs a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.\n \nRead more",

Honestly, did no one remember that February's Next Fest starts in, you know, February, in a week a bit's time this year? I'm all for getting a few things early to make the deluge of demos a bit more manageable to cover, but this year has just been a teensy bit insane. Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner. \nRead more",

It's a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either.

Cageside Seats reports \"McMahon [allegedly] enticed [Lesnar] to sign a new contract in August 2021 by offering Grant as 'a sexual commodity' for his use.\"\n\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the individual in question showed interest in a sexual encounter, but \"a snowstorm changed WWE Superstar's travel plans, and Ms. Grant ultimately used the weather and COVID-19 as an excuse to back out.\"\n\n\nBrock Lesnar is the only male UFC Heavyweight champion who was prominent on WWE programming during the events, leading many to speculate he was involved. \n\n\nThough Lesnar's involvement has not been confirmed in court, he's now been removed from WWE Supercard. It is also rumored that Lesnar was taken off the 2024 Royal Rumble card, with many reporting that former NXT champion Bron Breakker took his place. \n\n\nWith all these changes, fan's eyes are now on the roster of the upcoming WWE 2K24, as many wonder if he'll be featured in the game. WWE 2K24 is scheduled to be released on March 8 for those who buy the standard edition, with an early access period for those who purchase the Deluxe Edition or Forty Years of WrestleMania Edition. A full roster has yet to be announced, so fans will have to wait until closer to release to confirm if Lesnar is on the roster or not. \n\nThe post 2K removes Brock Lesnar from WWE mobile game after Vince McMahon lawsuit allegations appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're planning to dive into the world of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, don't expect Cliff to be with you. According to creator and game director Hideo Kojima, Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal) will not be returning for the 2025 sequel.\n\n\nFor those who need a quick reminder, Mads Mikkelsen played Captain Cliff Unger, the secondary antagonist, in the original Death Stranding, released in 2019. Throughout the game, Cliff would bring Sam into his war-themed Beach and attack him with BTs. Mads' performance as the militant entity brought him critical acclaim, leading to several awards, including Best Performance at The Game Awards that year.\n\n\n\n\nWhy isn't Mads Mikkelsen in Death Stranding 2: On The Beach?\n\n\nDespite the overwhelming praise for Mads' role in Death Stranding, Kojima explained both he and Mads believe that Cliff's story was told the best way possible and want to close that chapter on the character. \n\n\nWhile I was a fan of Cliff in the original, I wholeheartedly agree that the character shouldn't come back. It feels wrong when any form of entertainment brings well-off characters back for nostalgia or shock value. I'm looking at you, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with your Arkham Batman. \n\n\nRegardless, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach looks like a wild ride. Its latest trailer at the recent State of Play was...interesting. Troy Baker's Higgs is alive and looking like Gene Simmons and The Joker had a baby, and we now have a sentient puppet moving at 10 fps. Oh, and Mad Max director George Miller is here. I'm sure it'll all make sense when the game releases in 2025, but it's still crazy to think it could get weirder. \n\n\nFor fans of Cliff, don't lose hope just yet. We may see the character done in live-action from the A24 adaptation of Kojima's 'Strand' genre game. I wouldn't put it past Kojima to cast everyone, even Mads, as their characters again. All we can do is wait and see. \n\nThe post Mads Mikkelsen not returning for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While the franchise has been around since the initial game in 2005, the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series has really seemed to pick up mainstream popularity over the last few entries. Today, Rya Ga Gotoku Studio has confirmed just that. \n\n\nThe Sega-owned developers revealed that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth has already crossed over the 1,000,000 copies shipped threshold. It took the game a mere week to do so. \n\n\n\n\nWhen you look at review scores across the industry for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, it's easy to see why the latest core entry to the series is doing so hot. Destructoid gave the game a great review. On Metacritic the title earned a 92, 89, and 89 across the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC respectively. \n\n\nThe series did a bit of a soft reboot with 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon into RPG territory. As stated in our Infinite Wealth review, it has been a bit of a transition period for the franchise as the developers settle in on their vision, but RGG seems to have nailed it. It's clear from these sales that the series' fanbase is excited about where it's headed.\n\n\nTo commemorate Infinite Wealth's achievement, Rya Ga Gotoku Studio is releasing free in-game swag as a reward to players for helping in the title's success. The development team will be gifting a celebratory T-shirt set with timing and further details coming at a later date. \n\n\nIf you're still working your way through Infinite Wealth with its seemingly infinite things to do, check out Destructoid's Infinite Wealth hub. It features fantastic guides, walkthroughs, and plenty more to help get you all the cash and glory.  \n\nThe post Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth clears one million units sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "This morning brought us our first Sonic the Hedgehog 3 teaser trailer, and with it, indications that Jim Carrey will return as the nefarious Dr. Robotnik. \n\n\nParamount Pictures dropped the twenty-second tease this morning which showcased the Sonic 3 logo alongside confirmation of the movie's December 2024 release date. In the background audio of the clip, you can hear Jim Carrey's distinct laughter as the iconic Sonic villain.\n\n\n\n\nYou don't have to merely go on Carrey's Doctor Eggman laugh as proof of his return. Variety also confirmed the news this morning. \n\n\nCarrey, one of the most prolific comedic actors of all time, revealed in 2022 that he would be retiring from acting. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Carrey stated \"I’m retiring. Yeah, probably. I’m being fairly serious.\" \n\n\nHe went on to note that he likes \"my quiet life.\" Carrey said, \"If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I’m taking a break.”\n\n\nCarrey's quote came out shortly before Sonic the Hedgehog 2 went on to be wildly successful at the box office. So while the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 script likely isn't \"written in gold ink,\" Carrey's paycheck to return as Dr. Robotnik just may be. \n\n\nYou won't have to wait until December to get your Sonic movie universe fix, though. Knuckles, a six-episode live-action series is planned for early 2024 on Paramount Plus. The series will feature Idris Elba returning to voice the warrior Echidna. It will take place between the events of the Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 movies.\n\nThe post Jim Carrey returns for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you have plans for Valentine's Day, they better be with a fire-breathing boar. That's who you'll be tangoing with in two weeks, because Castlevania-inspired action game Lords of Exile finally has a launch date set for February 14, 2024.\n\n\nIt's been a while since we took a look at Lords of Exile, which initially smashed its relatively modest Kickstarter goal to the tune of 258% funding back in June 2020. Naturally, it grew into a more ambitious project in the months that followed, moving it well past the launch window they originally had in mind. As a result, it all looks pretty different from the earlier crowdfunding trailer, particularly when it shows the powers you can summon to aid you.\n\n\nLook, I'm just saying, if any video game had the elevator pitch of \"Castlevania with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stands,\" I'd be in before the exclamation point dropped. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, is this the same boar from before? Talk about a glow-up!\n\n\nScreenshot via Squidbit Works\n\n\nBeyond any Stand-like shenanigans—referred to as Shadows in the game's menu—Lords of Exile appears to pride itself on its simplicity. It even goes so far as to include \"linear level design\" as a selling point, really driving home what makes classic side-scrollers so easy to go back to time and time again. The pacing is also in line with the classic 'Vanias, as our stalwart hero plods along at a snail's pace in between leaps and slashes. \n\n\nWhen done right, these throwback adventures can be just as memorable as the inspirations behind them. Look at the Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon games, for instance, or (hopefully) the upcoming The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest. Where Lords of Exile slides into the lineup remains to be seen, so we'll keep an eye on it as it heads to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. In the meantime, you can try out a demo on Steam right now.  \n\nThe post Lords of Exile finally dated, looks like Castlevania with JoJo’s Stands appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In case you’re not feeling adequately rewarded while playing 2021’s existentially devastating FPS Cruelty Squad, achievements have been added to Steam that will tell you what a good job you’re doing.\n\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar, Cruelty Squad is jank pop royalty. It’s a grotesque and offensive-looking game where you play as a corporate mercenary carrying out assassinations in a world ruled by sinfully immoral rich people. What makes this different from real life, however, is that it’s maybe the future, and you can wear meat armor. Better yet, the meat armor works after a patch last March, but it didn’t when I initially played it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNow, achievements will be doled out for your insignificant progress. “I added achievements. You can suggest new ones to add here, I will not add them but you can do that,” said developer Consumer Softproducts on the Steam community page. \n\n\nFurthermore, the game’s overlord suggests that the achievements are only awarded “for completing each of the levels,” but if there’s one thing I know about the developer, it’s that you can’t entirely take what you say at face value. All the achievements are hidden, so I can’t tell you if it’s true. Knowing Consumer Softproducts, there is probably one in there with an extremely painful or impossible objective. However, they say, “I honestly just couldn't be bothered figuring out how they work,” which, I don’t know, could be entirely true.\n\n\nAdding achievements to a game is never a bad thing, but I dunno. When Cruelty Squad does it, it feels like it's insulting me.\n\n\nCruelty Squad is available for PC right now. It’s actually on sale right now, so you should buy it. As a reminder, the next game by Consumer Softproducts, Psycho Patrol R, is ready for your wishlist. I don't know if you should buy that yet, but my instincts tell me maybe.\n\nThe post Abhorrently garish FPS Cruelty Squad gets achievements appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can play it right now.\n\n\nBilled as a run-based narrative game, The Forever Labyrinth will have you diving into a variety of paintings. But unlike Super Mario 64 where you then harass the wildlife, you’ll instead solve mysteries. You enter the eponymous labyrinth looking for your friend, Professor Sheldrake, then find yourself trapped in a series of strange rooms with paintings hanging. Obviously, that’s not where you want to be, so the goal is to try and find your way out.\n\n\n\n\nThe game is built on InkJS, a Javascript port of Inkle’s Ink scripting language that allows it to run in browsers. It also utilizes Google Arts and Culture, which is a repository for artworks provided by museums around the world. It’s functionally a point-and-click adventure game meant to be played over and over in order to unlock all its secrets. The press release I have tells me a run takes about 20 minutes, but when you start The Forever Labyrinth, it says that the first run might take an hour. However, the game does tell you that it autosaves and picks up where you left off.\n\n\nIt’s pretty neat. If anything, it’s a good way to take in some paintings that you might not have seen otherwise. I’ve looked at an art once or twice before, but there aren’t really any major galleries in my area. The art framing the art is also well-executed, and it feels light and breezy.\n\n\nYou can play The Forever Labyrinth right now for free in your browser.\n\nThe post The Forever Labyrinth lets you uncover mysteries through famous paintings appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you’ve been holding off from buying the Resident Evil 4 remake until you could get everything in one package, your day has come.\n\n\nJust in case you are someone who was waiting to play Resident Evil 4, the following trailer is crammed to the rafters with spoilers, so maybe don’t watch it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Resident Evil 4 remake came out last year in March. It’s a pretty faithful retelling of the adventures of Leon \"Sandypants\" Kennedy in the 2005 classic with updated gameplay, shiny graphics, and a maybe less ridiculous tone. Just a bit less. Then, in September, Capcom released The Mercenaries and Separate Ways DLC, the latter of which remakes an additional scenario that first appeared in the PS2 port. The latter was also paid DLC, while the former is free.\n\n\nOn top of that is all the paid add-ons. These are additional weapons, costumes, treasure maps, and the original soundtrack. Unfortunately, they never got around to a costume/scenario/mode that involves Tofu, so I’m rather whelmed.\n\n\nI reviewed the Resident Evil 4 on release last March. I enjoyed it, but some people in the comments were very insistent that I didn’t enjoy it enough. It did, however, win Destructoid’s Best Remake/Remaster of 2023, beating out Dead Space and Super Mario RPG, so that’s high praise in a great year of remakes/remasters. However, if that wasn’t enough to get you to try it out, maybe an all-access pass like Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition will convince you.\n\n\nResident Evil 4 Gold Edition launches for PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 9, 2024.\n\nThe post Resident Evil 4 gets a Gold Edition next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not that I hate it, but the 3D platformer genre has never been my favorite, with some Sonic titles being the exception for somewhat nostalgic reasons. \n\n\nNevertheless, now and again, one arrives with so much personality and adventurous gameplay that it's nigh impossible to not fall in love with it. Penny's Big Breakaway is one of those titles, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with a demo for it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nPenny’s Big Breakaway is filled with content and refined mechanics, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise; the game is the product of Evening Star, a studio which features several developers from Sonic Mania, including Christian Whitehead.\n\n\nImage via Evening Star\n\n\nA world to explore\n\n\nLike most 3D platformers out there, Penny's Big Breakaway has a surreal premise…",

It's a common recipe for the genre, but the ones that stand out most don't follow a by-the-book approach.\n\n\n\nChildren of the Sun takes that formula and turns it on its head, and if were just any ole shooter, it wouldn't have held my attention long. However, it manages to be so much more with its puzzle game wrapping paper, ensuring I can't get enough just from my earliest of first impressions.\n\n\nIt's violent and clever without ever taking itself too seriously. If you're searching for a traditional FPS, this may not be the title to scratch the itch. For those of us seeking new experiences, whatever form they take, it's potentially 2024's most creat…",

          "description": "If you've been paying attention to the world of graphics cards lately, you'll know that Nvidia released SUPER variants of its RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti (link missing) GPU. Now, Team Green finishes its trilogy with the launch of the RTX 4080 SUPER, which was released yesterday.\n\n\nMuch like the aforementioned products, the new 4080 dials up the juice a bit when compared to its predecessor. For starters, it has 10,240 CUDA cores, while the previous model has 9,728. It also boosts the clock speed, memory clock, and bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\nNot everything's changed, though. It still retains the 16GB of GDDR6X memory that the non-SUPER RTX 4080 has. Also, the TGP is still at 320W and the memory bus remains the same at 256-bit.\n\n\nThe big change seems to be the price\n\n\nAs noted by Videocardz, Nvidia's latest Ada Lovelace card appears to have had a price adjustment when compared to the cost of the 4080 on launch.\n\n\nIt's still $999, which pushes it more towards the enthusiast area of pricing, but given that its predecessor was priced at nearly $1200 in September of 2022, it feels like a good drop.\n\n\nOf course, a grand is still a grand, and you can still pay upwards of RTX 4080 SUPER for $1,200 for it depending on where you shop. But at any rate, a lot of the PC hardware world is going to be watching what AMD will do next. Three new Nvidia cards in a month is quite the act to follow, even if they're not new-new, as such.\n\nThe post Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER graphics card is out now, this one is priced at a cool G appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Like a lot of other horror fans, I'm holding out that Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 won't be a major letdown. While we wait to find that out, however, we can treat ourselves to the new \"combat trailer\" shown at the most recent State of Play.\n\n\nThere are no prizes for guessing what the footage shows. While we get some of the cinematic goodness of the new Silent Hill 2, we also get to see James Sunderland and his guns making friends with enemies. Ha ha! Their heads ago a-splatter!\n\n\n\n\nBut in all seriousness, it seems the remake is doing a revamp of the combat to make it more modern. It makes sense. The original SH2 – as magnificent as it was – wouldn't work in this era with its rather outdated control scheme.\n\n\nNew Silent Hill when?\n\n\nOf course, the question on everyone's lips is: when's it coming out? Well, we don't know that I'm afraid. The trailer doesn't give a release date or even a release window. We can \"wishlist now\" and it's being made exclusively for PS5.\n\n\nOn a personal note, I'm slightly bitter that it's only coming to PlayStation. Sure, I could get it for PC, but there's no way on this – or any other – planet my laptop would be able to run it (my laptop says hi, by the way).\n\n\nFrom what we've seen, it looks like Bloober's take on what is considered a masterpiece has potential. Unless the studio deviates massively from everything that made the original so iconic, it's going to take a lot to really fumble an up-to-date reimagining of this horror classic.\n\nThe post Silent Hill 2 gets all violent in this combat trailer, still no release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

I loved 2020’s Chicken Police: Paint it RED, and was hopeful for a continuation. I got an early look at the demo, and it’s a pretty bland taste, but it’s not necessarily indicative of a problem.\n\n\nI think it’s difficult to build a demo of any narrative-centric game. Usually, these sorts of titles have a slow build with character introductions, and they may not begin any meaty twisting until later in the game. Trying to fit both the context and the hook into a demo without giving away too much of the overall runtime can be difficult, and Chicken Police: Into the Hive isn’t the most impressive attempt.\n\n\nIt doesn’t do anything to sully my excitement for the full story, but it doesn’t really heigh…",

However, as Pocketpair sends out another patch to fix a variety of bugs, the game continues to experience more popularity than...well, a very very popular thing.\n\n\nVersion 0.1.4.0 has been rolling out on Steam, with a lot of fixes being implemented. For starters, there's been an issue where players have been receiving damage twice. This has now been patched out. Also, players will \"no longer pass through walls when dismounting.\" That was a thing, it seems.\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward, expect a lot more Palworld updates. The developer says it's going to continue development, \"placing top priority on fixing major problems and issues.\" Given the current state of the game, fans would probably expect nothing less than bug fixes. Oh, also the update for the Xbox version is expected soon.\n\n\nNot enough people in Ecuador to play\n\n\nAlong with the recent patch, Pocketpair also gave the good word on Twitter/X that the game has experienced more than 19 million players. That's 12 million on PC and seven million on Xbox. That's about as much as...a very very large thing (I'm not good at analogies today, it seems).\n\n\nA few days ago, Palworld smashed through the two million concurrent player mark, according to SteamDB. It's become one of – if not the – fastest-selling game in recent memory. Two weeks. It came out just two weeks ago.\n\n\nWe're still waiting to hear what Nintendo/The Pokémon Company will turn up in its investigation. For now, Palworld continues to be as huge as...you know what...you can take it from here.\n\nThe post Palworld v0.1.4.0 out now on Steam, also game hits 19 million players appeared first on Destructoid.",

In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. \nIt’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course.

That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. \nCheck out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: \n\n\nAll three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12. \nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.\nNow, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.\nAnd for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.\nSonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.\nIn July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. \"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced,\" Iizuka says. \"The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time.\"\nBy adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.\nSonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here. You can also visit our exclusive coverage hub by heading here.",

The news was announced during today’s State of Play.\nThe game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. \n\n\nInterestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.",

Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.\nIf that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. \n\n\nKojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. \nHe then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"",

The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.\n\n\nAlongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole.

This new and improved version of Until Dawn comes hot on the heels of Sony announcing earlier this month that Shazam! director David F. Sandberg is directing a film adaptation of the game. \nCheck out the Until Dawn remake trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Until Dawn, and then check out our thoughts on its PlayStation VR spin-off, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. Supermassive released a spiritual successor to Until Dawn in 2022 called The Quarry – read Game Informer's review here – but its next game is Little Nightmares III, which is due out sometime this year. \nAre you excited for this Until Dawn remake?

          "description": "Today's PlayStation State of Play delivered a new Death Stranding 2 trailer and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is weird as hell. The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, \"These days I am Fragile in name only,\" before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.\n\n\nThe trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.\n\nOther interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.\nThe trailer ended with the phrase, \"Should we have connected?\" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the PlayStation 5 exclusive game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.",

Silent Hill: The Short Message is a new free experience that'll be available later today.\nCheck out the trailer below to see it for yourself.

As Polygon detailed at the time, the leaker \"Dusk Golem offered some hints at its narrative, naming two characters (Anita and Maya) and hinting that SMS messages would factor into the game somehow.\" This lines up with much of what's in the trailer.\nDespite the previous leak, The Short Message was still a bit of a surprise, as it's yet another new Silent Hill project but wasn't one of the many annoucned back in 2022, which revealed the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake, the maligned Silent Hill: Ascension, as well as Silent Hill f and Silent Hill: Townfall.

Not only did we see plenty of gameplay in a new trailer, but PlayStation and developer ShiftUp revealed the game is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 26. \nPlayers will take control of Eve, a member of the 7th Airborne Squad. Her mission is simple: save the planet. She was supposed to do this with the rest of her squad, but most were lost in the descent to Earth. However, she finds two friends in Adam, who lives on Earth, and Lily, a member of the 5th Airborne Squad who provides Eve with engineering support. Lily will help Eve unlock new abilities like Double Jump. \nCheck out that double jump and more in the Stellar Blade gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn Xion, a city built under the wasteland of Earth by the planets' last survivors, Eve is called Angel by the survivors, and seen as an object of both awe and fear. However, they'll loosen up as Eve shows commitment to building the city. Survivors will ask Eve for help with things like rescuing sisters in need or finding lost cats. These requests will send her out into the dangerous desert wasteland, where Eve will run into dangerous robots and alien-like monsters called Naytibas. \nStellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024. \nFor more, check out this gameplay trailer from 2021 when Stellar Blade was still called Project Eve. \nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health.

As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.\nAn app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. \n[Warning]\nJanuary 31, 2024\nPocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. \nPalworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year.

That fix took hours, leaving those who paid for the Deluxe Edition, which is $30 more than the standard edition, unable to play the game at all as Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice Leauge is an always-online game. \nTo make up for that issue, Rocksteady has gifted Deluxe Edition players 2000 LuthorCoins, which is roughly $20 of in-game currency that can be…",

          "description": "Apex Legends, like all live-service titles, is no stranger to balancing updates. Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool. These changes, in addition to many others, morphed the meta in significant ways, but one particular update trumped the rest: Revenant's rework.\nThe n…",

The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.\nAs for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.\nWhat are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play?

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
