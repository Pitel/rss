          "description": "My library's in ruins.\nLibrary of Ruina is less than the sum of its parts. While this visual novel's dialog sets up a well-established, deep world with interesting characters, its talky repetitiveness eschews plenty of opportunities to make the most of what it's trying to set up. And even with a compelling, card-based battle system that rewards clever play and a measured approach, both story and gameplay move too slowly to lend a tangible sense of progress thanks to poorly optimized menus, which ensure that any momentum falls through the cracks. We can see its charm for fans of a very specific type of visual novel, but coming in as fans of the snappy, tactical, and luck-driven satisfaction of other deckbuilders, this didn't scratch the itch we'd hoped it would.\nYou play as Roland, a street thug in Library of Ruina's cyberpunk dystopia who's been magically teleported to a mysterious library. Library of Ruina follows Roland and his custodian Angela as they attempt to build out the library and uncover its secrets. In order to fill the library's seemingly infinite credenza, Roland must defeat and kill other humans in battle to gain possession of their books which in turn earns him new cards to experiment with.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Smoothing out the creases.\nIt’s been nearly 20 years since we first set foot on the cobbled streets of Rogueport, the hub town of GameCube favourite Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Back in 2004, the seedy streets of the criminal town felt like nothing else in a Mario game – suspicious characters roam the streets, puddles pool on the pavement, and cracked windows add a slice of decoration. To those who have played Thousand-Year Door, Rogueport became a character in its own right and served as a platform for an exciting adventure.\n20 years later, we felt exactly the same stepping into Rogueport in the Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. This place still feels entirely unique not just in Paper Mario canon, but in all of Mario adventures. That sense of unease, excitement, and wonder sets the stage for Mario’s most beloved RPG adventure. We’ve played through the prologue and the first three chapters of the Switch version, and it’s been a joy revisiting this classic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Slice 'n' dice the frame rate.\nMany games can get away with slightly sketchy performance if the gameplay experience is a bit more laidback and relaxed (or ‘cinematic’, if you like). Others, however, like Slave Zero X, which focus on blistering combat and stylish visuals, can be almost impossible to recommend if their performance isn’t up to scratch. Sadly, this is exactly the case with publisher Ziggurat Interactive’s retro action game, which honestly has the potential to be one of the most respectable hack 'n' slash/beat ‘em ups in recent memory, but for now, squanders this on Switch with a dreadful frame rate.\nThis is genuinely frustrating because the core gameplay is exceptional - truly. And for a short period as we worked our way through the game’s opening level, we thought to ourselves, “Good lord, this is great!” Unfortunately, while the introductory level boasts reasonably stable performance to complement the non-stop action, the frame rate tanks after you beat the first boss and move onto the second stage. It got so bad that we had to swallow our pride and eventually call it quits before the end, defeated by the poor optimisation on Nintendo’s console. The publisher says there's a patch on the way which should alleviate this, but the game came out nearly two weeks ago at the time of writing, and the damage is done.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"more than just pirate versions\".\nYou’re probably aware of Square Enix’s lengthy and somewhat lavish efforts to remake the 1997 game Final Fantasy VII. The second instalment of this ambitious remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, was released just recently, and we’re still likely to be years away from any sort of conclusion. But you might not be aware of an earlier attempt to remake Final Fantasy VII – or more specifically, to demake it.\nIn 2005, a company called Shenzhen Nanjing Technology released a 2D version of Final Fantasy VII for the Subor line of bootleg Famicom consoles (AKA Famiclones). Although necessarily cut down to fit within the capabilities of 8-bit technology, this demake nevertheless managed to pack in most of the plot points from the 32-bit PlayStation game, and it was just one of many ambitious demakes from the time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. \r\n\n\r\nI mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm.

Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show's mad popularity, it'll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a \"variety of quest updates\" across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to \"stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth\".\nThey're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage. If you're similarly concerned, you might want to disable auto-updates right now.\n Read more",

As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.\nThis had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?\nSure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.\nSo, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?\nJoin me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire.

And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a \"mini-rework\", which means drugs like morphine are \"less of a 'solution for everything'\". Wait. What?\r\n\n\r\nSubmariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have \"a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.\" Well. Guess I'll just die. \r\n \nRead more",

This time: Hall effect keyboards, a relatively fresh flavour of desktop peripheral that’s been gaining traction with manufacturers for the switch design’s supposed durability and reliability benefits. These represent perhaps the first major challenge to mechanical keyboard hegemony, but you may be wondering: who’s Hall? What’s their effect? And does it actually make for a better gaming keyboard?

They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab's Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it's crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it's colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I'd say.\nRead more",

          "description": "I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn't like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely \"Republicans buy sneakers too\", if you ask me.\nIt made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.\nRead more",

It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes, I hear critics describe something as ‘actively hostile’ to the act of playing it, but with something close to admiration in their voices. I've always felt that I, too, would like to one day find an artwork that I could describe in the same way. Partly because it sounds like an interesting experience, but mainly so I could steal that line and feel like one of those elite, urbanely perceptive, multiple trouser-owning critics.\nWell, today is not that day, because indie horror IRIS isn't, in fact, actively hostile towards the act of playing it. It's more a case of passive disdain. Is it a ‘good’ game? Probably not. Ah, but is it enjoyable? Buddy, not even slightly. But it is intriguing. I am intrigued, reader.\n \nRead more",

And if you’re new to it, thankfully, those plot elements are fairly straightforward.

Those companies are: Asmodee Group, which comprises Embracer’s tabletop games biz; Coffee Stain & Friends, an evolution of the existing Coffee Stain publisher, who will pursue \"a dual focus on indie and A/AA premium and free-to-play games for PC/console and mobile\"; and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends, “a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC and console, as well as the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties, among many others”. \r\n\nAfter writing roughly 100,000 posts about Embracer’s butchering of vast swathes of the games industry, this is surely my chance to raise a cheer and celebrate the conglomerate’s unglomming with a cool glass of turnip juice, but it is Monday, the man next door is shouting again, and I am tired - so tired that only ill-suited Simpsons references come to mind.\nRead more",

This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.\nCreated by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick. The brawling is simple but satisfying enough, and the way office equipment violently degrades when hit is better, but this isn’t why I’m recommending the game.\n \nRead more",

This is not much fun, though it's a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a \"studio apartment\". It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. \r\n\n\r\nLucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must \"draft\" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.\r\n \nRead more",

And yes, some of it is annoying and obtuse and will almost certainly suit veterans who enjoy those quirks, but it has a surprisingly easy going nature. Hundred Heroes accomodates new players like me with combat that's simple to grasp and a story that's emotional and sprawling and absolutely worth your time.\nRead more",

Mostly, though, I think it’s because of my brain doing the thing where, say, you notice a yellow car on a walk and then see dozens of them. I was going to write a car make there but I don’t know any.

Following on from the mega update of 1.6 a month ago, and 1.6.3 soon after that, the hardy perennial farming game has a new 1.6.4 mini update. The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you've not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say \"Pah! You should play Stardew Valley.\"\n1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it's nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.\nRead more",

Nancy is hired to find said heirloom, and interview a bunch of suspects, one of whom is creepy puppet guy up there (there are no screens of Nancy because she never actually steps out from behind the camera in these games; she may as well be a cryptid).

There are also unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts. Slightly confused by the unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts, if I'm honest. It feels a bit like developers Abrams Studios are unconvinced as to the popular appeal of mushroom hunting, and have garlanded the concept with random mythology so as to widen the Venn diagram overlap between \"fungi fans\" and \"people who want to live in cyberpunk Narnia\". \nRead more",

With this week's release of Fedora 40, it's shipping with GCC 14.0.1 as the development version that will culminate with the inaugural GCC 14 stable release in the coming weeks. Plus Fedora 40 has all of the other latest GNU toolchain components and then over on the LLVM side is with the current LLVM 18 stable series. For those curious how GCC 14 vs. LLVM Clang 18 performance is looking, here is a wide range of C/C++ benchmarks carried out on Fedora Workstation 40 using a System76 Thelio Major workstation powered by the Zen 4 AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7980X.",

The spot will be filled with many fish, jumping out of the water. This is, for all intents and purposes, a Fish Frenzy. \n\n\nOnce you’ve found this spot, cast your line and you’ll be able to enjoy much shorter times between bites, allowing you to catch a large number of fish. Of course, the fish you catch will be limited to the type associated with the current Frenzy and you should make sure to take plenty of Bait and Bobbers.\n\n\nHow to maximise profit from a Fishing Frenzy\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nFish are, at base level, usually not worth much. However, if you’re looking to sell your caught fish for profit, you can massively increase their value by using a Smoker. \n\n\nWhen placed in a Smoker, fish retain their quality while their value is doubled. Depending on the fish, you can make a lot of Gold this way.\n\nThe post What is a Fish Frenzy in Stardew Valley? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo has yet to publicly chime in on the issue, and some members of the GMOD community claimed that a \"fraudster\" is engineering the crisis instead.  In response to the community's concerns, Garry Newman of Facepunch Studios said that his team was \"doing [its] own investigations\" on the matter.\n\n\nSetting these suspicions of foul play aside, however, Newman has since clarified that he's been \"assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit, so [the content takedown] will continue as planned.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo-related uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot,\" says the announcement on Steam. At the same time, some of the community members who have been keeping track of the situation as it developed have been trying their best to preserve the mods for as long as possible. A worthy objective or a breach of IP law? Time will tell.\n\nThe post Garry’s Mod is pulling down years of Nintendo content, but players suspect foul play appeared first on Destructoid.",

This means when Season 12 drops, Sea of Thieves’ open crews should be available again.\n\n\n\n\nThis also means that if you bought Sea of Thieves premium version on PS5 in order to get the five day Early Access, then Open Crew won’t be available until it fully launches on April 30. It’s a pretty big bummer for anyone who paid extra on PS5 and doesn’t have a pre-existing group to team up with.\n\n\nHowever, PVP matchmaking and private crew should still be available. You will still be able to battle against other ships and can still play with friends, but the drop-in crew system is non-functional for the next few days.\n\n\nTo reiterate, Open Crew matchmaking is currently down. It should be fixed and re-enabled for the April 30, 2024 Season 12 update.\n\nThe post Sea of Thieves Open Crew matchmaking down, when will it return? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The only trouble I and many other PS5 fans are having is working out when the game will be available to play. \n\n\nWhat time does Sea of Thieves early access release on PS5?\n\n\nScreenshot via PlayStation's YouTube chann…",

Each arc offers a mixture of heartfelt moments, intense action sequences, and a new Anya expression to behold. However, all good things must come to an end, and we're here to explain if the Spy x Family manga is finished. \n\n\nIs Spy x Family manga completed?\n\n\nSpy x Family is still ongoing, as new manga chapters are still rolling out. There seems to be no end in sight for the series, so you can look forward to more exciting new content for the Forger family. \n\n\nImage via Wit Studio/CloverWorks\n\n\nManga readers can anticipate two to three chapters per month. Platforms like Viz Media and Manga Plus stay up-to-date on the series, and the three newest chapters are free to read. Additionally, there are extra side stories to explore, adding more depth to the beloved characters Loid, Anya, Yor, and many others. \n\n\nThe Spy x Family manga offers a rich tapestry of storylines, including the intriguing Friendship Schemes, the suspenseful Mole Hunt, and the high-stakes Term Finals arcs. Each chapter delves into the adventures of Operation Strix, an elite mission dedicated to maintaining peace in Westalis and Ostania. \n\n\nWhere does the Spy x Family anime leave off in the manga?\n\n\nThe anime's Season 2 ending occurs sometime around Chapter 60 in the manga. The show still has quite a bit to catch up on, so we don't have to worry about the anime ending anytime soon. The Spy x Family Code: White movie also features even more Forger shenanigans as the family participates in Eden Academy's cooking competition. \n\nThe post Is Spy x Family manga finished? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here is everything you need to know about adding the bundle to your collection. \n\n\nActivision confirmed Suns guard Devin Booker is getting an operator bundle in MW3 and Warzone. Booker joins his Phoenix teammate Kevin Durant, who received an operator bundle in 2023. In a recent appearance on the Aux Money Podcast, Durant revealed that Booker is \"elite\" at Warzone and averages 12 kills a game. \n\n\nHow to get Devin Booker in MW3 and Warzone\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nThe Devin Booker operator bundle can only be obtained through the CoD store. Activision did not reveal a price point, but based on previous operator skins, it will most likely cost 2,400 CoD points, equivalent to $19.99.\n\n\nWhen is Devin Booker coming to MW3 and Warzone ?\n\n\nActivision announced that players can purchase the Devin Booker operator bundle starting May 1. Coincidentally, this aligns with the NBA Playoffs. Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns are currently down two games in the first-round series against Minnesota. It's quite possible that the Suns season will be over by the time fans get a chance to purchase this operator bundle, which would be unfortunate timing. However, a comeback is never out of the cards when you have fellow NBA superstar Kevin Durant on your side. \n\n\nEverything included in the Devin Booker operator bundle.\n\n\nHere is everything that comes with the Booker operator bundle. \n\n\n\n“DBook” operator skin\n\n\n“Sunrise” MTZ-762 Battle Rifle weapon tracer blueprint \n\n\n“Sunset” WSP-9 SMG weapon tracer blueprint \n\n\n“Sick ‘Em Haven” finishing move\n\n\n“Booker Card” large decal\n\n\n“Lucky Ace” weapon sticker\n\n\n“Man’s Best Friend” charm\n\n\n“Be Legendary” loading screen.\n\n\nThe post How to get the Devin Booker operator bundle in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Raven Software planned on removing the High Trip Resurgence limited-time game mode from Warzone, but decided instead to give players a chance to keep it around for another week. Yet what many expected to be a slam-dunk vote has devolved into a more heated debate. \n\n\nThe Warzone devs created a poll for players to decide whether or not they want the High Trip Resurgence LTM to return. As of writing, 50.7 percent of the 23,171 votes lean yes, while 49.3 percent said no. This is a surprise, after players initially pleaded for one of the game mode's features to be added permanently. High Trip Resurgence operates the same as a traditional Resurgence match for the most part, but players collect gummies that each have a power-up. Green Boost Grants players a temporary speed boost and negates fall damage, Fill Up awards faster reload speeds, High Focus highlights enemies with a red outline, and Loot Blast offers more loot from crates.\n\n\nImage via Activision \n\n\nAfter getting a taste of unlimited-tac sprint from the green gummy, some players were ready for it to become a feature in every mode. However, other users weren't as fond of the mode and wanted it removed. CoD content creator TacticalBrit asked, \"Are we genuinely going to keep an LTM that's just a reskin of the boy's LTM, and we've literally had no others?\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Warzone content creator JGOD was shocked by how divided the poll was. \"They don't seem to lean into LTMs, and the 1 time they do, half the people vote not to keep it,\" the YouTuber added. \n\n\nWarzone Meta asked,  \"For the people who voted no, do you hate having fun?\" If the devs don't plan on adding a playlist in its place, it's hard to tell why players would feel so negatively about High Trip Resurgence. But it's clear that players are frustrated and this poll paints a much more troubling picture about the overall community sentiment regarding the battle royale. \n\nThe post Warzone players divided over adding back High Trip Resurgence LTM appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",

That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series' heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…",

          "description": "Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.\n\n\nLike leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.\n\nOf course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.\nYou can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.",

Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. \nThis new setting can be found under \"Social Privacy\" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game. \nFor more about Fortnite, check out these Avatar: The Last Airbender skins now available in the game, and then read about how Fortnite's next Star Wars crossover will span Lego, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.

It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. \nIf you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. \nThe trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99.

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.\nThe Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. \nJack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.\nNew #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡\n\nTune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.\n\nWatch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N\nApril 16, 2024\nIt's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.\nIf that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.\nWe won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.",

          "description": "Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. \nParamount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. \nMeanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.\n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.\nAvailable as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. \nThe benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. \nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8",

          "description": "Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.\nWe have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb\nApril 15, 2024\nThe most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.\nThe current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.\nPrevious Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. \nIf you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the upcoming Fortnite x Star Wars crossover?

However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.\nLawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. \nNow, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”\nRELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. \nSomehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!\nhttps://t.co/1COV57FZQ5\nApril 13, 2024\nThe RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.\nWhat did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again?

          "description": "The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.\nBut the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.\n“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. \nRogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”\nMy hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.\n“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”\nTo read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.",

The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. \nCheck out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, visit our hub by clicking the banner below.",

Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.\nRKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.\n\n\nValah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools.

And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. \nAs someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. \nWatch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nThere's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, \"Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure.\" Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. \nIt's also \"focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries,\" according to the page. \n\nAs for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later. \nDo you want to check out Sketchy Fables?

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
