Its roster of ‘Lolis’ (or ‘Lolitas’, for those less au fait with anime lexicon) are a group of female witches aged 11 to 17 that occupy Gilverado, a Halloween-themed world filled with dragons, wizards and giant, satanically possessed cows. Each character’s weapon and orbiting spirit familiar offer different advantages for survival and scoring, and shot types can be alternated between a faster (but weaker) laser, and a slower, more powerful cannon.

No, Bohemia Interactive haven't announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for \"any potential new Arma game\", so maybe that's something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don't have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they'll release some sort of \"playable demonstration of its features\" at some point \"soon\".\nRead more",

Halo Infinite's best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens' house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.\nRead more",

As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. \nYour reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.\nRead more",

Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks.

First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale.\nRead more",

          "description": "Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)\nInstead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.\nRead more",

In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.\nRead more",

Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. \nHe's one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There's plenty of that nonsense in Ewins' set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you're a motorist in south west England, chances are you've probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon's Magic Roundabout. It's a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I'm not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London's equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham's Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. \nIt's the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you'll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there's one challenge that's truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts. \nRead more",

I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. \r\n\n\r\nThat’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger's cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day! \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nMartin’s post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin’s official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks “incredible.” On that final point, I’m inclined to agree.\nElden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?",

          "description": "After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline shooter entries up to Halo Infinite, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Halo: Combat Evolved.  \nDeveloped by Bungie, Halo: Combat Evolved was positioned as the launch title for Microsoft's promising but unproven Xbox. Released on November 15, 2001, Halo redefined the first-person shooter and immediately solidified the Xbox as a must-own console. It's tough to imagine what Microsoft's place in the game industry would be today without Halo's success. Bungie became a household name, but the studio existed long before Halo and struggled financially prior to its launch. Twists and turns such as axing Halo's original PC exclusivity and going through bizarre working titles such as The Santa Machine are just some of the fascinating topics we'll unpack in this week's episode. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's video game debut.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com. You can also join our official Game Informer Discord server by linking your Discord account to your Twitch account and subscribing to the Game Informer Twitch channel.

If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there's a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics.

The system is a great buy for people who can't get enough JRPGs and adventure games, but that's not all it has to offer. We've compiled some of the top games for the system, including some fresh and familiar faces.\nSony doesn't seem to be supporting the system as aggressively as it did when it launched, but it's far from a barren wasteland. Japanese developers have taken advantage of its high-end portable specs to deliver gorgeous-looking RPGs, and indie developers have found a place to explore their comparatively smaller and quirkier ideas. There's a wide variety of gameplay to be found on Vita, as our list highlights.\nHere are Game Informer's picks for the top 10 games on the PlayStation Vita, as it currently stands.\n\n10.

          "description": "Following its re-release earlier this year on consoles, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance has finally released on PC today. No, not the sort-of-reboot from this summer. That's Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, a very different game. We're talking about the OG! It's been a 20-year journey for the action RPG, first released on PlayStation 2 in 2001, that saw ports on Xbox and Gamecube, but never Windows until now.\nWhile its store description says it uses the 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons rule set, Dark Alliance plays out more like Diablo than the more strategic-feeling Baldur's Gate titles. You'll play as one of three characters representing the archer, fighter, and sorceress classes, fighting hordes of mystical minions, and taking quests through Black Isle Studios' rendition of the Forgotten Realms. \nThis updated release features higher resolutions (up to 4K!), solo or co-op play, and full controller support on PC. For those reading this, who prefer playing on console, you're in luck. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch, too. \nAnd now we wait patiently for Dark Alliance 2 to surface on current hardware. Once, again, we are not talking about a sequel to this summer's game with a similar name.\nHave you played the PC version of Dark Alliance yet, or even the console ports? How does the game hold up after all of these years? Conviene in the comments and chat with us about it!",

This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at a special start time of 3 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

It was also noted that despite the studio's most recent release Back 4 Blood, which was published by Warner Bros.

Hudson told YouTube channel Countdown City Geeks that a new one is on the way and that scheduling for recording voice-over is underway, as reported by Nintendo Life. Hudson also said fellow Ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd, who plays Ray Stantz in the films, is attached to the game as well. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“I just got an email because we’re doing another video game,” Hudson told Countdown City Geeks. “They’re scheduling it now to do the recording and I’m not too sure [who is] going to do it. I know me and [Dan Aykroyd], I think. I’m not sure [if Bill Murray] will do anything on it. So, there will be another video game…When they’ll bring it out, I don’t know, but it’s definitely happening.” \nSpeaking further about the game, Hudson said whoever is developing it is sending him “prototypes of the character to get the image right.” He said the team seems to have a hard time creating his image, citing that while whoever is developing it is able to nail down Murray and Aykroyd’s likeness, he always ends up “looking like Eddie Murphy or somebody.” \nAt the time of this writing, whatever Ghostbusters game Hudson is referring to has not been officially announced so it seems the actor let slip something he (probably) wasn’t supposed to. While waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the 2009 game in Game Informer’s Ghostbusters review and then read about how it was recently remastered and re-released in 2019.

          "description": "Square Enix and Marvel have revealed a new collaboration with Adidas in the form of six new sneakers inspired by the universe’s most unlikely team. \nAnnounced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians. There are two based on Eidos Montreal’s take on Star-Lord, and then one for Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we’ll likely learn more sometime next year. \n“A key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters – whether it’s the stitching details on Star-Lord’s leather jacket, Groot’s earthy color palette, or Drax’s unmistakeable tattoos,” Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. “From there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team – with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.” \nFor more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix’s full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here’s what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost. Here’s what each looks like: \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nIf you haven’t yet played Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, you should – it’s great, and you can read about why in Game Informer’s Guardians of the Galaxy review. Find out which awards Guardians of the Galaxy took home at The Game Awards 2021 and then read about this patch that added ray-tracing to the game after that. \nAre you going to try to buy a pair of these shoes?

The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure entails.\nThe game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a “hand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.” The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine rulers, called Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist’s cat-like appearance (which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).\nNine Sols doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms, so it’s probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games' horror titles, it’s exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what's become their usual wheelhouse. \nIn the meantime, check out our review of Red Candle Games' most recent release, Devotion.",

          "description": "In the year since its launch, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has proven to be one of the more robust and popular installments of the long-running franchise. Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.\nThe Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…",

After showing what Horizon Forbidden West looks and runs like on PS5, Guerrilla Games has given the world a glimpse at what Aloy's next adventure looks like on the previous Sony console. \nIn a tweet, Guerrilla offered a peek at four screenshots from Forbidden West running on PlayStation 4 hardware. While it doesn't say whether the captures came from a PS4 amateur or a PS4 Pro, the vistas on display are still stunning to behold. Take a glance at the lush jungle flora with a mechanical bird hovering overhead, a desolate desert settlement, the Tallneck in all of its towering glory, and Aloy strolling through a pond riding atop what looks to be the horse-like Strider.\nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nThese images do look great, and yes, I'm sure if you put them next to their PS5 counterparts, you can nitpick which details may be missing, or how far the draw distance for LODs are. But instead, we're going to take this preview of the rare PS4 visuals and celebrate how good they look on their own merits. If the performance side of the game pans out as well as these stills have, last-gen PlayStation owners may not feel as much pressure to find an elusive PS5 before Horizon Forbidden West's February 18 release.",

Developer Cats Who Play and publisher Slitherine today released the first details and two short videos that give us glimpses at how this future war will unfold for PC players.\nSet in the same universe as the Terminator: Dark Fate film from 2019, Defiance delivers a campaign experience that puts you in the role of the Founders faction's commander and asks you to keep the last remnants of humanity alive. You may even have the chance to deal a devastating blow to the Legion's machines. As you make progress, you'll rally allies to your cause, but the choices you make could have consequences.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nCats Who Play revealed details that your weapons and vehicles will take on damage, meaning armor and hull integrity could wear thin over time and leave your troops vulnerable. If a building collapses, the physics-based debris could devastate your efforts. You can also use physics to your advantage to take out well-fortified enemy strongholds.\nIf you'd rather play as the machines, you'll get the chance to do that in the multiplayer and skirmish modes. In these avenues of play, you can control the Founders, Legion, and Resistance. For multiplayer, the battles can be 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2.\nCats Who Play hopes to have Defiance out in 2022, although no specific date or season has been announced at this time.",

He’ll still be streaming, but he’s now making the jump to the game development side of video games by way of new studio Midnight Society. \nWelcome to Midnight Society /// https://t.co/xuTZGJskyx pic.twitter.com/RWWQSaXcGY\nDecember 14, 2021\n“We flip the tables on the traditional video game development model and embrace the ‘Day Zero Community,’” the Midnight Society website reads. “That means including our players – yes, you – from the earliest most inception. That could be testing reload times and recoil patterns on a firing range or jumping in for the first-ever PVP sessions. No more ‘I hope this game will be good.’ Be there when your voice can actually make an impact because we want to hear it. Really.” \nAs for what to expect from Midnight Society, the studio does not have a formal announcement for a game. However, all signs point to a multiplayer shooter. Be it Beahm’s involvement, former Call of Duty and Halo developers, the mention of “reload times and recoil patterns in a firing range” or the job listing description that urges possible employees to “step up, strap in, and start defining the next best competitive multiplayer experiences, period,” it seems Midnight Society’s first game will be a shooter. \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nThe website features some images, too – seen above – that might hint at what the team’s first game could be. It might be concept art, but it could also be nothing related to whatever Midnight Society is working on as well. We'll see sometime in the future. \nAre you excited about Midnight Society?

          "description": "Sony Pictures Entertainment released the first official trailer for its upcoming Uncharted movie, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, back in October and it featured plenty of iconic sequences from Naughty Dog’s action-adventure series. \nThat trailer led many to speculate that while Uncharted takes place before the Naughty Dog games, opting to go with a much younger Nathan Drake, the movie would be touching on each of the games in some way. For example, we see the iconic cargo-plane-over-a-desert sequence from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception in the trailer. We also see Chloe Frazer in the trailer, a character who doesn’t appear in the games until Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and the main antagonist seems pulled right out of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. \nIf you were looking for a tie or connection to Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, the newest poster released by Fandango today has you covered. \nAs you can see in the poster, it’s quite reminiscent of Uncharted 4, or rather, one of the final settings in it. Near the end of Uncharted 4, our cast is swinging from pirate ship to pirate ship in search of pirate gold and an escape from a ruined pirate city. Nathan Drake eventually makes his way to what is basically a pirate ship graveyard and it looks a lot like what’s seen in the background of this new poster. \nAs for how Uncharted will tackle this connection to Uncharted 4 – which mind you, is just speculation for now, but like, come on, look at it – alongside the nods to the other Uncharted games, we’ll have to wait and see when Uncharted is released in theaters on February 18. All that’s left now is to hint at The Lost Legacy and Golden Abyss. \nWhile waiting for this movie to release, check out the first official trailer and then check out this look at Nolan North, the voice actor of Nathan Drake, on set with Holland.  Are you excited about Uncharted?

Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.\nThe update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. \n❗️Inscryption: Kaycee's Mod❗️\nhttps://t.co/ohMNIFpK6F pic.twitter.com/c7sfQHHNFi\nDecember 14, 2021\nTo access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. \nIn a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game. The expansion is billed as a beta, so expect some eventual balance changes as well as two new cards/items, more dev logs, and even a final encounter at the end of the 12th level. \nFor more on Incryption, be sure to check out our review. \nWill you be firing up Kaycee's Mod?
