Hamster Corporation has, to date, released 280 titles, and another 108 specific to the Neo Geo hardware, all with a commitment to emulating arcade originals at affordable prices. Taito Milestones 2 is a collection featuring 10 Taito-specific titles, following on from the first Taito Milestones released in April 2022. While highlights of the original included Elevator Action (1983) and The Ninja Warriors (1987), this follow-up’s library is altogether more attractive, featuring bigger, more desirable titles, and a nicely balanced set of genres.\nFirst up, The NewZealand Story (1988), one of Taito’s most beloved action platform games, remains as delightful as ever. You must navigate Tiki the Kiwi through four zones and 16 stages, using weapon power-ups to thwart cute enemies and locate exits in a maze-like layout. Despite being ported to almost everything during the '90s, the original still remains the neatest and most compelling version.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

El Tigre is the superhero star of Nickelodeon's 2007 show El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, which saw the 13-year-old protagonist taking on his family's heroic genes as the masked cat-like crime fighter.

Having watched its game director Jon-Paul Dumont steer me through a 30-minute demo, I’ve come away with the impression it’s far more than just a cheap LOTR pretender.

          "description": "Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged \"cut content\". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being \"left out\" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. \"Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3,\" Gaider wrote on Twix. \"BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Officially unveiled at this week's Panic Games Showcase, Arco is a triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape. It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me. Here are some very early impressions of it.\nRead more",

It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.\nYou can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing.

          "description": "The original Destiny storyline opened following the collapse of a vast Terran civilization at the hands of an invading, amorphous Darkness and its various alien accomplices - an advance stymied only by a benevolent Big Dumb Object known as the Traveller. It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary and/or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. \r\n\n\r\nFast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, \"episodic\" - content \"cadence\" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Far bet it from me to complain about Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The London Case introducing more incongruous eye candy, after my previous conniptions over Hot Hipster Poirot with his ankle-grazer trousers and his sexy egg-shaped head, but tick tock, it's himbo Hastings o'clock. Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).\nTechnically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Before Diablo 4 came out, Blizzard had concerns that their latest ARPG would tank the popularity of their most recent entry in the series, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson tells RPS. Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. \"In fact, it was the opposite,\" he says.\nRead more",

          "description": "When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was \"who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum\". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's \"creative sequel\" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the \"what if\" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield. Find a trailer through the jump.\r\n \nRead more",

Said skirmish has now escalated to \"-gate\" status, with \"Tilegate\" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing \"dreamable\" space sim Noctis. \r\n\n\r\nWho knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So, I was rather excited when I had a chance to play it for all of ten minutes in one demo, then around 40 minutes at this year's Gamescom.\nBlazing fast mental arithmetic puts my total time with the game at around 50 minutes... with a catch. The two demos were identical, though, so all of my time was dedicated to smashing the same large skeleton and large rock man. I got to know them and it's battle system intimately, I suppose, so while I can't speak for the quests, but the fights? Gloriously chaotic.\nRead more",

As you may have heard by now, Diablo's Season Of The Malignant didn't exactly go down all that well, with much of the hissing and fang-bearing directed toward its nerf-heavy balance patch that arrived a couple of days before the season started in earnest - a series of events that Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson describes as \"a perfect storm of a couple of situations\" when I sit down to talk with him at Gamescom. \n\"Season one was exceptional, because we did something we'd never do again,\" says Fergusson. \"As part of listening to players wanting to carry over their renown, we had to put the patch out a couple of days before the season. The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance.\"\nRead more",

I'm struggling to pin it down through the growing white noise of early middle age - as with much else in my life, everything blends into a gritty soup of Metroid and DOOM beyond the turn of the millennium - but I suspect it might have been a level from Rebellion's amazing 1999 Giger 'em up Aliens versus Predator, which I now recall only as screenfuls of fangs illuminated by Smartgun fire. \r\n\n\r\nDoes Sonic 2's Flying Fortress Zone count as abandoned, given that almost every NPC aboard is robotic? Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile \"Legendary\" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame. There's fresh news on this front from senior level designer Zach Wilson, who has been waxing lyrical online about \"the tragedies and perils of space travel\".\nRead more",

In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's \"HD-2D\" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is. \nRead more",

My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.\nI may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.\nRead more",

But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels.

The downside of such a bounty is there are even more gems getting overlooked than usual, because nobody has the time even when we're aware of them. Like, for example, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.\r\n\nIt absolutely is the Jet Set Radio tribute it looks like, and it's a delight even if, like me, you never really liked the originals. Inspired by, rather than tracing over the rail grinding, spraypainting, all-dancing classic. It plays a little smoother, it clocks in shorter, and runs a little faster, but it's undeniably dancing to the same beat.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.\nThe game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here.

I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch. While it's way too early to make big judgement calls like, \"the entire game will be good\", it might have more of a chance at launch survival than I thought.\nRead more",

Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. \nOn its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing? \nRead more",

But references to Remedy’s past games have been the big conversation driver, especially since the studio is building up a “Remedy Connected Universe.” Creative director Sam Lake has now clarified that time-bending shooter Quantum Break and the Max Payne games aren’t cool enough to join the Remedy-verse, while also breaking down their approach to these shared-world games.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The immersive sim playground, sequel to an RPS favourite from 2019, looks even more over-the-top than the original. You can smash through buildings in a truck. Or smash through buildings on horseback. Or smash through buildings as a giant gorilla. Or... you get the gist. In other words, there should be a metric mega-ton of options when the game hits early access next year, as you'd expect if you played the first Streets Of Rogue.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Tencent are bringing back NovaLogic's venerable tactical FPS series Delta Force. Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The Final Fantasy VII mobile spinoff has attracted ample curiosity since its original announcement, given that it aims to functionally remake the original game alongside the “compilation of” titles. But with Ever Crisis’ latest trailer, Square Enix reminds us that the upcoming RPG will add some new lore too.\nThe big feature here is CG footage of an undoubtedly boyish-looking Sephiroth. With the text “We still don’t know Sephiroth” flashing on the screen, it appears we might see a more heroic side of the iconic Final Fantasy villain.

          "description": "Given the current hype surrounding Starfield, you're never too far away from a discussion of all things related to Bethesda, including The Elder Scrolls 6. We all know that it's likely years until the Skyrim follow-up sees the light of day, but at what stage of development is it currently at?\nAccording to an interview on the Spanish website Vandal with Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, the studio has actually started work on TES6 proper. Right at the very end, when asked about whether the upcoming RPG was still in the concept phase, Hines confirms that development on the game is underway.\nhttps://youtu.be/OkFdqqyI8y4\nHowever, there's always a proviso. He goes on to say that it's in \"early development\" (according to translation by GameSpot) which pretty much confirms what many of us suspected anyway.\nProbably won't hear much else for a long while\nA little further up in the interview, Hines makes it clear that while there have been people working on TES6, the focus for Bethesda right now has been Starfield. As such, it's possible that resources may shift to the long-awaited Elder Scrolls game once the latter is out, though that's pure speculation on our part.\nIt's nice to know that development has begun, even if it's still in the early stages. However, there's a good chance we won't hear much about it for a while. But then, we have sort of grown accustomed to that by now.\nIt's been five years since the studio announced The Elder Scrolls 6, originally showing the above teaser footage at E3 2018. We've heard pretty much nothing since, but hopefully things will move a little quicker soon after Starfield's launch.\nThe post The Elder Scrolls 6 is now in ‘early development,’ Bethesda confirms appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "UK Switch owners will soon have one less option to get some boxing practice. This is because Fitness Boxing will no longer be available to buy on the UK eShop within a few months.\nNintendo UK announced the sudden loss on Twitter, and the last day to buy the game is November 30, 2023. No reason has been announced explaining why Fitness Boxing will be removed. Delistings can vary for any reason in a region, but many are a result of license expirations: these can be over specific music tracks and footage to even someone's likeness.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1696872183216103763\nFitness Boxing never made a splash at the time of its release. In fact, reactions to this news have been indifferent, with one commenter stating they'll buy the game for a pound. Its 2018 release did make it among the Switch's first fitness games, beating Ring Fit Adventure by around a year. It still stands out as a game focused primarily on boxing, with each activity focusing on the sport. There are even two sequels! There hasn't been any announcement regarding the US or Japanese digital releases, so they are likely safe for now. What's even more odd about this situation is that Nintendo helped publish Fitness Boxing outside Japan.\nWhatever reasons there are for Fitness Boxing's delisting in the UK, this news is unfortunate. Interest in the game may have waned over the years, but many developers worked hard on it. There likely are still people in the region who might consider picking it up, especially on a sale.\nThe post Fitness Boxing is being removed from the Nintendo UK eShop by the end of the year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Starfield excitement has reached an all-time high, and the game's shown itself in a number of unexpected places, including London's trains. Some have taken their love of Starfield to surprising heights, including Mythbusters' Adam Savage who has a YouTube series tracking his creation of an impressive model of the Frontier spaceship Bethesda has showcased.\nHe teamed up with Bethesda Game Studios to build this model, allowing it to be shockingly detailed and accurate. The YouTube series isn't done yet, so you'll have to wait a little longer to see the final product.\n[caption id=\"attachment_400552\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]\nThe complex spaceship-making process\nCrafting a model of the Frontier is a time-consuming task, though it's been made slightly easier by the fact that the spaceship is modular. This makes things a tad simpler for Savage and his team, as it means they can make the individual components separately before bringing them all together.\nCreating all the parts takes a lot of 3D printing, metalwork, and painting. For added realism, the spaceship's also being kitted out with electronics, including lights and adorably small working monitors. A little more crafting and wiring is left before all the components are assembled and the spacecraft is complete. After that's done, the team plans on filming the spaceship.\nhttps://youtu.be/NK63W1Y3dNE\nWatching the construction process is quite calming, and it's impressive to see the model get closer to the amazing Frontier spacecraft we've seen so often in trailers. Savage's team aren't the only ones caught up in the Starfield hype. TEMPUR has created a one-of-a-kind chair designed to make you feel like you're in a spaceship cockpit.\nThe post Adam Savage is building a Starfield spaceship model appeared first on Destructoid.",

A handful of new creatures are entering the fray soon, which is scheduled for a September 5 at 10AM (local) through September 10 through 10AM (local) debut.\nBecause it's Niantic, this isn't a full kickoff for Scarlet & Violet; just a drip-fed rollout of a select few characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRYjvkKwkmA\nHere's the full list of Paldean Pokemon coming to Pokemon Go at launch:\nSprigatito\nFloragato\nMeowscarada\nFuecoco\nCrocalor\nSkeledirge\nQuaxly\nQuaxwell\nQuaquaval\nLechonk\nOinkologne\nHere are the evolution requirements:\n25 Sprigatito Candy to evolve Sprigatito into Floragato, and 100 Sprigatito Candy to evolve Floragato into Meowscarada.\n25 Fuecoco Candy to evolve Fuecoco into Crocalor, and 100 Fuecoco Candy to evolve Crocalor into Skeledirge.\n25 Quaxly Candy to evolve Quaxly into Quaxwell, and 100 Quaxly Candy to evolve Quaxwell into Quaquaval.\n50 Lechonk Candy to evolve Lechonk into Oinkologne.\nBringing a selection of Paldean Pokemon into the fray still isn't a big win\nRubbing salt in the wound, Niantic also announced in that same blog post that Unowns were returning to the raid pool, but they haven't addressed many complaints from fans earlier this year. There are constant posts on many communities talking about how they play less (myself included) after the remote raid price was hiked to 195 Pokecoins in March of 2023. This is on top of stingy reward payouts for players.\nOddly, Generation 8 starters (and much of the Galar region in general) are nowhere to be found, which is confusing a ton of fans. The Pokemon Company has a lot of sway here in terms of what actually gets rolled out when, but Niantic's track record has given folks pause as to when that might actually happen.\nThe post More Scarlet & Violet creatures are coming to Pokemon Go soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's at least an indication that Sea of Stars is becoming another surprise hit, in a year already full of bangers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jkeh6O1Rzs\nStarry eyed surprise\nThere's a few good reasons to pick up a game, even if you have it through a subscription. I know I've personally used Xbox Game Pass as a way to demo a game, and if it's something I know I'll want to play later on down the line, I'll buy it so I don't lose access if it leaves Pass. Sea of Stars had a demo prior to launch, and may have left a strong enough impression that people locked their license in based off that.\nOr maybe people are also like me, in that they buy games without remembering they were on Xbox Game Pass/PS Plus. I'm not the best barometer for sensible purchasing decisions.\nEither way, it's a reaffirming notion to see Sabotage's RPG chalking up numbers fast. It's been a golden year for RPGs, and it's nice to see that's not just for the biggest blockbusters.\nWe're still picking away at Sea of Stars here, but if you're a fan of chill fishing minigames, Mario RPG-style combat, and great music, it's worth a look.\nThe post Sea of Stars hits 100K copies sold on its launch day appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Konami has announced that their HD remaster of the first two Suikoden games have been indefinitely delayed. Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars will now arrive sometime later.\nSuikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars was announced nearly a year ago with a vague release date of 2023. Since then, we haven’t heard much about it.\nThe Suikoden games are a bit obscure in North America, but they have a dedicated fanbase. The first game in the series was released in Japan on PS1 in 1995, with the sequel following in 1998. The last title to be released in North America was the 2008 spin-off for the Nintendo DS, titled Suikoden Tierkreis, while the last Japanese title was Gensō Suikoden: Tsumugareshi Hyakunen no Toki. It’s no surprise that Konami has sat on the series for so long, as the publisher is legendary for hating fun.\nhttps://youtu.be/ibpBLv47IaY?feature=shared\nThe remasters are currently showing off some updated visuals, and Konami has stated that they’ll also have some quality-of-life updates and other fixes over the previous versions.\nIt may also be worth noting that series creator Yoshitaka Murayama is now working on Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, which is said to be a spiritual successor to the Suikoden series, and is planned for release in 2024.\nNo new release date for Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, but 2024 sounds like a decent bet. It’s slated for Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Switch. You might be interested to know you can still get the first two titles on PS3 via the PlayStation store. They don’t, however, have the planned quality-of-life updates.\nThe post Suikoden I & II HD Remasters have been delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just a couple of months after Microsoft increased the price of Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus will be following suit. In a post on the PlayStation blog revealing the September PS+ titles, it was revealed that the 12-month Subscription prices for all tiers will be increasing.\nInterestingly, this only affects the 12-month bulk buy for the subscription. Prices for the 1-month and 3-month subscriptions are not increasing. Essentially this just means you won't be saving as much by buying the bulk 12-month package. In total, it's a $20 increase annually for the Essential tier, a $35 increase for Extra, and a $40 increase for Premium.\nHere are the new 12-month subscription plans:\nPlayStation Plus Essential 12-Month Subscription\nPlayStation Plus Extra 12-Month Subscription\nPlayStation Plus Premium 12-Month Subscription\nIf you have an existing 12-month subscription, the increase begins on your next renewal date on or after November 6. However, the new price takes effect on September 6. This means any upgrades, downgrades, or buying additional time for your subscription will update your plan to the new price.\nSubscribers have expressed their dissatisfaction with the price increase in the comments on the blog post. It's especially discomforting to see a price increase in the same post as a very disappointing reveal for the September monthly games. One of the three additions is a premium pack for MMORPG Black Desert Online, which in a way feels more like an ad than a game addition. Also, Generation Zero is one of the added titles for which we scored a 2.5/10, if you're curious if it's worth trying.\nThe post PlayStation Plus 12-month prices are increasing for all tiers appeared first on Destructoid.",

At Gamescom, a new live-action trailer was revealed to get fans into the space exploration mood. You can also be an explorer here on Earth by locating the 1,001 unique ads Bethesda has hidden all over the world.\nhttps://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1696543447761432748\nAs Bethesda has explained, these ads are \"windows to the worlds\" of Starfield, providing a peek into what you can expect from the game.

Finding them all is a monumental task, but fans have been coordinating themselves in Bethesda's official Discord server. Currently, Bethesda's established server channels for the following locations, though not all the listed countries have found ads yet:\nAustralia\nBelgium\nBrazil\nGermany\nItaly\nMiddle East\nNew Zealand\nNetherlands\nNordics\nPoland\nSouth Africa\nSpain\nUnited Kingdom\nAll the ads are also numbered, making it easier to keep track of which have been discovered.

Originally, the console versions were going to launch simultaneously with the PC. However, they were abruptly delayed about a week before the expected launch.\nThe PC version packs in the original campaign, all the expansions, a newly created campaign, and a tonne of comfort features to make it the best version of the legendary 1995 FPS.\nhttps://youtu.be/rNTLqDdWMmk?feature=shared\nIf there’s any difference between the PC and console versions, the press release doesn’t really say. In particular, I’m wondering if the map maker and fanmade Return of the Triad campaigns are going to make it in.\nI gave high marks to the PC version of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. As a shooter, it’s a little bit of a tough sell in the modern market. It does a lot to hide that it’s built on a beefed-up Wolfenstein 3D engine, but still suffers from a lot of restrictions. However, the development team clearly had a fun time on the project, and that shines through. Also, Nightdive’s efforts at porting the game to the KEX Engine are impressive and comprehensive, as always.\nRise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition is currently available on PC.

Yes, that dog, adorably named \"Oatchi,\" is arguably the start of the game. Not only does it look cute: it also heavily factors into the storyline of the fourth main iteration, and it's one of the most useful game mechanics I've experienced in a long while.\nIt took very little time to get acclimated to how the little pup worked, and before long I was riding along with him, sending him on odd jobs while I split up my Pikmin force. Dandori (the art of organization, essentially) is a huge part of the game's philosophy and level design, and Oatchi slots perfectly into that ethos. As someone you're able to independently operate alongside of the different types of Pikmin, it's a blast to discern what jobs he's best for, and what upgrade tracks you want to tackle first. \"Build potential\" is not something I ever thought I'd be tinkering with in a Pikmin game, but here we are. Did I mention Pikmin 4 rules and you should play it?\nI love it when Nintendo gets weird\nAll of Oatchi's glory is reflected in a new promo titled \"Oatchi, the Space Dog of Tomorrow,\" which you can view below. Expect lots of old-school sci-fi references, not unlike most of Bethesda's Fallout marketing. It's also not a bad way to see what the game actually entails, and what Oatchi does in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SpyDGhzaVI\nThe post This cute Pikmin 4 PSA proves that Oatchi is the best character of 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The song, titled Children of the Sky, incorporates the main theme music from the open-world RPG. In the video for the song, we also get a special fly through the world—well, universe—of Starfield.\nIn the video we get a look at the protagonist, our playable character, walking across the surface of various planets with beautiful skyboxes above. Some of these views are ones we haven't seen before, but that's to be expected as Starfield has over 1,000 planets in total.\nImagine Dragons is no stranger to making music specifically for games. Their hit song Radioactive was used heavily in the promotion of Assassin's Creed III back in 2012. Also, Imagine Dragons has made music specifically for League of Legends and its hit animated Netflix series Arcane.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1a-OrikdM&t=4s\nWhether you're a fan of Imagine Dragons or not, one thing is certain about Starfield: the hype is very real.

However, with that extra cost, you'll get a lot more power compared to the Steam Deck.\nThe starting option comes with 512GB of storage. Meanwhile, the priciest model (which could set you back at least $1,700) will boast 4TB of storage and 64GB of RAM. That's quite the beefy machine when stacked up against Valve's system.\nWith a 75Wh battery as well, it sounds like a portable PC that could topple the Deck. But that price tag presents a much steeper barrier to entry.\nIt looks like we're about to see an influx of mobile gaming devices. Valve will need to be diligent to stay on top.\nThe post Another Steam Deck rival is on the horizon in the guise of the Ayaneo KUN appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you enjoyed the hellish aesthetics of Agony and the psychosexual tones of Succubus, you may be looking forward to Madmind Studios' upcoming game, Paranoid. If so, you'll want to check out the twelve minutes of gameplay the developer uploaded to their YouTube channel.\nThe footage puts us in the shows of Patrick Calman as he makes his way through a sewer. All the while, he contends with voices taunting him and hostile sewer-dwellers getting in his way.\nhttps://youtu.be/copCSWCHDLg\nWe get to see a little bit of the story, in which the 31-year-old Calman is experiencing trauma from the loss of his parents and the kidnapping of his sister. The footage is still a work-in-progress, but you can get a feel for how the game looks and plays.\nA different kind of hell\nAt the moment, there's no release date for Paranoid. The Steam page shows an October 2023 launch window, which would make sense given that this is a horror title. A Halloween release wouldn't exactly be unusual for the genre.\nHow will it compare to the likes of 2018's Agony? Hopefully much better, as that game didn't receive an amazing reception, with some even calling it the worst game of that year. Our reviewer didn't even finish the game.\nConversely, 2021's Succubus earned better scores, with it showing as \"Mostly Positive\" on Steam, so there's hope for Paranoid. As mentioned, the above gameplay footage is still a work in progress, so any jank should be ironed out by the time it releases.

If you're planning to play on Xbox Series X/S or you purchased your PC version on Windows Store, preloading has been available since August 17. Steam players had to wait a little longer, but preloading has finally opened.\n[caption id=\"attachment_400251\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]\nIt's a good idea to preload this massive game\nYou're advised to take advantage of the chance to preload if you want to play as soon as possible. The preload alone weighs a hefty 116GB, which could take a while to download for those with less-than-stellar internet speeds. By dealing with the preloading now, you make it easier to start playing when launch day hits.\nIf you purchase the regular version of Starfield, you'll finally be able to explore the Settled Systems on September 6. For those who can't wait that long, the Constellation Edition and Premium Edition are also available, and they both grant you early access from September 1. Fortunately, if you bought the Standard Edition and change your mind, an upgrade to Premium Edition is available.\nIt's a large game as it is, and it may grow bigger. The first story expansion, titled 'Shattered Space' has been revealed, and owners of the Constellation Edition and Premium Edition will have access to it when it launches, though it hasn't been given a release date yet.\nThe post Starfield preloading is live on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The intense mech action franchise debuted in 1997 but remained niche, with an ardent fanbase keeping the series afloat. Developer FromSoftware was quite a different place then versus today, with the '90s studio publishing a mixed bag of gems and duds.\nWhen Armored Core debuted on the PlayStation, it became one of those gems. As archaic as its controls feel now, they fit the bill for early 3D action games and worked effectively without analog sticks.

It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.\nThe PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.\nOn September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:\nEssential - $79.99 (from $59.99)\nExtra - $134.99 (from $99.99)\nPremium - $159.99 (from $119.99)\nYou can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.\nIn the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.\nThe move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising.

The presentation is set to air on August 31.\nBeginning at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET the Direct will run for about 15 minutes and, hopefully, peel the curtain back on Wonder’s new features and power-ups. The game's biggest change centers on the Wonder Flower, which transforms stages into trippy versions of themselves laden with mind-bending effects. More than anything, however, we’re excited to see more of Mario's new elephant transformation as well as the elephant versions of his friends.\nJoin us for an in-depth look at Mario's latest 2D side-scrolling adventure in the livestreamed Super Mario Bros. Wonder Direct!\n#SuperMarioBrosWonder #NintendoDirect here: https://t.co/cLiWEN2hHd pic.twitter.com/Nyb3bqnZ4R\nAugust 29, 2023\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is the next 2D sidescroller in the legendary franchise. Mario is joined by Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and Daisy in an adventure that can be enjoyed with up to four players. The game is slated to launch on Switch on October 20. Most recently, we learned that Mario's long-time voice actor, Charles Martinet, has retired from the role and does not voice Mario in Wonder.",

Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. \n\n\nHere are the PC specifications for Starfield: \nMinimum: \nOS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti\nDirectX: Version 12\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nRecommended: \nOS: Windows 10/11 with updates\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nAs you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. \nStarfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. \nWhile waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. \nAre you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6?

Sorkin’s credits span numerous sitcoms and other TV series throughout the ‘80s, but her biggest break came in the launch of 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series. Creator Paul Dini wanted to introduce a new character to serve as the Joker’s one-off sidekick. After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance.

Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. \nAshmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx\nAugust 25, 2023\n“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment,\" says Ashmore in the video. \"Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will.\"\nAlan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest.

          "description": "Earlier this summer, developer Jump Over The Age revealed Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, a sequel that occurs “some time” after last year’s Citizen Sleeper. Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. \nThe game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: \n\n\n“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” \nThis sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” \n\nIf you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. \nThere’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. \nIn the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.\nAre you excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector?

First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vampire Survivors on Switch, Gunbrella, Mr. Run and Jump,  The Crew Motorfest, Ra Ra Boom, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Sea of Stars.",

The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.\nThe free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator. Finally, the game is now playable in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish.\nLil Gator Game is available now on Switch and PC.

          "description": "Earlier this summer, PlayStation revealed a dedicated handheld remote play device that puts one half of a DualSense controller on each side of an LCD screen. However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” \nThe PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. \n\nPSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. \nPlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.",

They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. \nSimilar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals. \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.",

And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. \nCheck out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. \n“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” \n\nPearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. \nFor more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.\nAre you excited about Crimson Desert?

The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. \nYou can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” \nToday’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nWhat did you think of today’s Black Myth: Wukong trailer?
