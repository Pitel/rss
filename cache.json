There are very good reasons to pick this game up and there are equally good reasons to pass on it; whether or not it’s worth your time will likely depend on how much of a fan you are of the series.\nThe narrative in Made in Abyss closely adheres to the premise of the series, which is set in a society built around an enormous abyss in the middle of the ocean. Nobody knows exactly how deep the abyss goes or what awaits at the bottom, but all sorts of powerful artifacts and riches have been found within on expeditions, which makes ‘Cave Raider’ one of the most coveted and respected professions around.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "But for how long?\nIf there's one thing that's defined the most recent console generation, it's shortages. Shortages of semiconductors, parts, and other components, have led to a shortage in stock for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles and have also affected Switch production. But we seem to have hit a turnaround if August's monthly charts from GfK are anything to go by. (Thanks, Gameindustry.biz.)\nIn the UK, console sales for all three major manufacturers rose in August, but Sony's big white tower has seen the biggest increase (a 56% stock increase), and as a result, it has now become the best-selling console in the UK in 2022. If you've been keeping an eye on the weekly game charts, then you'll know that Horizon Forbidden West has been doing particularly well, and that's because of a PS5 bundle — and it seems to have worked.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The once-expected tradition of camping out for midnight game launches — so timed as to technically adhere to official game street dates while still capitalising on gamer obsessions and enthusiasm — is, at least in New York City, on the verge of extinction thanks to numerous factors like public safety, liability concerns, pandemic precautions, and overall consumer welfare.\nBut on this date, September 9, 2022, the spirit at least lived on, thanks to Nintendo NY’s formidable RSVP system, which requires hopeful purchasers of — in this case — Splatoon 3, to log in on their My Nintendo account, and reserve a timeslot in a virtual queue to buy the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).\nPart of the challenge is working out what's worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September. \nRead more",

Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.\nThis year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on 'em.\nRead more",

          "description": "It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. \nBut the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.\nRead more",

Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.\nAt its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.\nRead more",

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.\nAlas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow. \nRead more",

Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In it, we're whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You're Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband's new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.\nThis takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It's a bit too easy, in fact.\nRead more",

It's a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. \nNormally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it's down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we've ever seen on this model.\nRead more",

Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. \nIn Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line. \nRead more",

Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It's ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it's invaluable.

But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.\nNeowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.\nOverall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!\nRead more",

It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.\nTo call Northern Journey \"retro\" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action.

I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.\r\n\n\r\nVentura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.\r\n\n\r\nWhile it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new edition has been bolstered with a huge variety of new features including two-player couch co-op, a selection of filters and orientation options, and a full suite of modes including Arcade, Practice, Boss Rush, and Overkill modes. The centerpiece of the remaster is a fully remixed and re-recorded score, composed and performed by artists from the Game Center Mikado collective.\nAlready available on Nintendo Switch, the new port will arrive on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, and is the first in what is expected to be a full range of \"x MIKADO\" titles, that will revitalize arcade classics with opulent, beautifully composed scores from some of Japan's most talented gaming composers. Given the long-held love affair between shmups and frenetic, pulse-pounding beats, starting out with the legendary Raiden IV was certainly something of a no-brainer.\nRaiden IV x MIKADO Remix launches in the west on PC and consoles January 31.\nThe post Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix will jet west in January 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Remember, Ash's Gengar is available until September 15, so you can get a few free Pokemon while you're at it. The entire team that this event is celebrating includes: Dracovish, Dragonite, Gengar, Sirfetch'd, and Lucario. All you need to do is load up the mystery gift screen and enter the code below (if you have your copy of the game but haven't started it yet, you'll need to spend a short while with the intro to unlock the mystery gift functionality).\nAll of these distribution events noted here apply solely to Pokemon Sword and Shield, as we start to enter the new generation of the series in just a few months. While there's been a handful of other games since then, it'll be easy enough to get all of these free creatures in a box somewhere and ship them off to Scarlet and Violet whenever the bank service is available.\nAsh's Sirfetch'd code for Pokemon Sword and Shield:\nH1SS ATSU NEG1\nThe post PSA: You can get Ash’s Sirfetch’d now in Pokemon Sword and Shield appeared first on Destructoid.",

How did it make you feel? The Arrangement manages to showcase the multiple emotions of Sonic Frontiers.\"\n\"Emotions\" is definitely a vibe the team has been going for since Sonic Adventure, and this song hearkens back to the bygone era of the late '90s/early aughts. It's hard to believe this new era of 3D Sonic basically started in 1999, and it's still carrying on today.\nAs for the song, I think it fits. It's not my favorite (I'm way more into the Frontiers ending song, and more into ONE OK ROCK in general), but if the team was going for an old school vibe, I think they accomplished that goal. You can listen to it yourself below and make your own call.\nIn case you're curious, Sega has provided the full personnel list for the Sonic Frontiers main theme song:\nVocals & Lyrics by Merry Kirk-Holmes (To Octavia)\nComposed & Arranged by Tomoya Ohtani\nStrings Arranged by Takahito Eguchi\nGuitars & Programming by MEG\nStrings by Muroya Strings\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyCYA4iC_Wo\nThe post The Sonic Frontiers main theme brings back memories of playing Sonic in the 2000s appeared first on Destructoid.",

But the gameplay seems similar to something like New Super Mario Bros., in the way it has four players navigating the screen together.\nHere's the trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_PCKwC484\nThe plot seems to follow the Disney pals helping out a group of adorable furballs who need some help. The team will need to unlock special abilities, solve puzzles, and take on bosses to save the island of Monoth. By retrieving all the books from all the biomes, they can save the day. And maybe run into some cartoon-y hijinks along the way.\n\nCo-op platforming adventures\nDisney Illusion Island is in development at Dlala Studios, whose previous work includes the 2020 Battletoads reboot. Although that got some mixed reception, I'm actually pretty interested in Disney Illusion Island.\nThe newer art style of Mickey, Minnie, and the gang has grown on me. Though that's probably due in part to some clips making the rounds on social media.\nAnd a chill, family-friendly co-op platformer seems like a decent time too. I could see this being an obvious pick-up for Switch owners with one kids.\nAs it is now, we'll see more of what Disney and Dlala have in store sometime in the future. Disney Illusion Island is set for Nintendo Switch in 2023.\nThe post Disney Illusion Island is a co-op platformer with Mickey and pals appeared first on Destructoid.",

It still continues to do well to this day, but nothing will compare to that first summer where it took the world by storm. The game's developer, Niantic, has had a few projects since, and now they've newly announced a collaboration with Marvel to create a game titled World of Heroes.\n \nThe project was revealed today during the Disney x Marvel Games Showcase stream, and all we know so far is that it's coming sometime in 2023. The trailer did include a website where players can go to pre-register, which will likely be up within the next day.\n\nLike I said, the announcement (which I wouldn't even call a trailer because it was so short, to be honest) was pretty slim, but based on what we know of Niantic's games from the past, I think we can take a pretty educated guess as to what the gameplay will be like. I imagine you get to play as different heroes from the Marvel canon, as evidenced by the people in the trailer wielding the iconic weapons of characters like Thor and Doctor Strange.\nFrom there, I could imagine there being bases you could visit in the real world, like the PokéStops in Pokémon GO, powerful items that you can find laying around the world, and I'm sure you'll be able to battle other players, of course. At this point it's pure speculation, so we'll have to see when the game finally drops... whenever that will be.\nThe post Pokémon GO developer Niantic is making a Marvel game appeared first on Destructoid.",

In its reveal back in May, the team assured that while Marvel Snap is free-to-play, every card will be available through gameplay.\nProbably shouldn't let Thanos play Snap\nOne of the key mechanics in Marvel Snap is the titular \"snap\" move, allowing players to effectively double-down. It's a bluffing mechanic that reminds me a lot of Gwent, and could add an interesting dynamic to play.\nSecond Dinner is also advertising fast play sessions, at just three minutes a pop. Seems like the idea is to pick up and play quickly.\nConsidering the way Hearthstone dominated the digital card landscape so fast, I'm interested to see what this team puts together. With the whole Marvel universe behind it for fodder, the team certainly won't lack for interesting characters to toss in. Fingers crossed for some Squirrel Girl.\nIf you want to keep up with the game and be ready to grab when it's live, you can pre-register over on the Marvel Snap site here.\nMarvel Snap debuts for mobile and PC on October 18.\nThe post Superpowered card game Marvel Snap hits PC and mobile in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's the full description:\n\"In a new Grid, forgotten by its creator and left alone to evolve without User intervention, an unprecedented crime has been committed. The Repository stands at the center of this society. In the aftermath of a break-in, the future of this Grid hangs in the balance. TRON: Identity is a visual novel adventure following Query, a detective program tasked with uncovering the mystery of what was taken and by whom. Finding yourself in a world built on unstable foundations and filled with whispered knowledge, it’s up to you to question suspects and investigate your surroundings to piece together the truth.\nThe decisions you make will actively influence the story, with a multitude of possible outcomes, good and bad – all depending on your carefully chosen words. You’ll interact with a number of intriguing characters, and decide whether to ally with them, spurn them, or even derezz them. However you choose to deal with them, you’ll need to recover their lost memories in your search for answers, puzzling your way through defragging Identity Discs. The world of TRON is growing, and your adventure is the seed.\"\n\nThe game boasts an original story as a \"new extension of the Tron franchise,\" which is great news as Disney really isn't doing anything with it at the moment.

All five of these characters are being immortalized on an OLED Switch, too. Early on Lechonk really took off, and most recently Armarouge and Ceruledge have been seeing a lot of praise, especially from Mega Man fans. A few readers even noted that they could make a great Smash Bros. dual character one day (great idea!).\nIn any case, it looks like a good spread so far, and you can see all the new Scarlet and Violet additions in one place below. I think I can vibe with pretty much everyone so far?

But a tool was also tucked into the patch: official mod tools for Cyberpunk 2077.\nIn patch 1.6 (via Eurogamer), REDmod is set of new modding tools for CD Projekt Red's open-world RPG. It's a free DLC that adds \"integrated upport for installing and loading mods\" into Cyberpunk 2077.\nThe REDmod also adds new modding tools which can be used specifically for Cyberpunk 2077. These tools can be used to create things within the world of Cyberpunk, ranging from custom sounds and animations to scripts. CD Projekt Red says it will keep REDmod continuously updated alongside game patches, to ensure compatibility.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbVKBoDuhZ0\nMaking a mod\nIf you've been following the PC scene for Cyberpunk 2077, you're probably already aware of some pretty good mods out there. I'm personally a big fan of the one that makes the metro a real, rideable metro. Future trains are cool!\nSo how does this work with CD Projekt's modding tools? Well, NexusMods has a helpful page dedicated to this exact situation.\nNew mods will require a specific format to be compatible with the REDmod application going forward. Cyberpunk 2077 will still support loading old mods from the archive folder, but they will not appear in the REDmod menu.\nFor users, NexusMods says the most crucial thing to know is that old mods still work. And for authors, there is documentation on the Cyberpunk website for the new tools.\nI'm interested to see how modders receive this, and what they're able to do with the new tools. That said, more mod support is hopefully a good thing. As much as CD Projekt Red can do in supporting the game short-term, we've seen what mods can do for games like Skyrim.\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 gets official modding tools through REDmod appeared first on Destructoid.",

First showing up in Final Fantasy V, Gilgamesh is a frequent recurring character in Final Fantasy series.\nAlongside all this, the Wanderer of the Rift expansion also adds the Blue Mage job. I always dig a fun Blue Mage option in games, and it makes sense for post-launch DLC for Stranger of Paradise, adding a good reason to jaunt back around looking for monsters.\nGetting even stranger\nThis is the second of three planned expansions for Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. The first, Trials of the Dragon King, also added some new jobs, story content, and a higher difficulty mode.\nDifferent Future is the third expected expansion. All three are part of the season pass, which you'll need to pick up if you want more Stranger of Paradise content.\nIn our review of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, Chris called it one of the \"weirdest\" games he's reviewed in a while. And having played a good chunk of it myself, I'd have to agree. But it's nice to see the chaotic, bizarre action of Stranger of Paradise get even more crossovers and content.

In addition, Crystal Dynamics regains ownership of Legacy of Kain, while Eidos Montreal retakes the helm of cult stealth series, Thief.\nThe sale comes at a perfect moment in time for Crystal Dynamics, as the studio is about to embark on the development of a brand new Tomb Raider title, one that will harness the power of modern platforms and the stunning Unreal 5 engine to create a world of exploration and adventure like none Ms. Croft has ever encountered before. With Crystal Dynamics now fully in the driving seat, this bodes incredibly well for the return of both Lara and Tomb Raider — As for Deus Ex, we'll just have to wait and see.\nWhile it is understandable then many are feeling trepidation at the current craze for mergers and acquisitions that are swamping the games industry, it is possible for some good to come from said sales.

That's 10:00 UTC, or 3:00 a.m. PT for those on the west coast. East coasters have it a little bit easier, with a 6 a.m. ET air time.\nFor those who are awake and tuned in, the stream will have live English interpretation and subtitled assets for those outside of Japan.\nhttps://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1567830960133099520\nNo indication's been given yet as to what will be announced. Though, given the recent tease of some footage from the next Yakuza, that seems like a likely candidate.\nThe studio has confirmed it's working on the next Yakuza game already. It will be a follow-up to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and it will retain a turn-based RPG approach.\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio will also be without Toshihiro Nagoshi, who left the company and has established Nagoshi Studio under NetEase. It'll be interesting to see what's next for Ichiban and the crew, and the Yakuza series in general, if we get a glimpse during the RGG Summit.\nSummer's end gaming news blitz\nThat's far from the only showcase next week, too. Next week is the 2022 Tokyo Game Show, and companies like Capcom, Square Enix, and Bandai Namco are all lined up to air streams.\nXbox and Twitch are also airing a showcase next week for ID@Xbox, too.

For beginning players all the way up to experts, Hundred Days gives players complete control over their own winery — from which vines to grow to choosing which yeast and bacteria to add for the fermentation process to deciding on the bottling details.\nEvery choice you make along the way will determine the quality and quantity of wine that you end up producing, making Hundred Days the perfect choice for any prospective winery owners. There's even a couple of different DLCs you can purchase, like the Napa Valley expansion that allows players to \"explore a new American wine region,\" and the Grape Lab expansion that allows players to \"create and produce [their] favorite grape variety.\"\n\nOn top of the in-depth simulation mechanics, I also just love Hundred Days' art style. It's kind of cartoony and saturated with color, and I have to admit that seeing those deep purples does get me in the mood for a wine-making experience. Finally I will be able to live the glamorous Napa Valley fantasy that was instilled in me as a child after watching the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. I don't think the game allows you to play as a sexy Dennis Quaid who rides horses all day, but here's hoping that's the next expansion pack.\nHundred Days will be free to download from the Epic Games Store, along with a bundle for battle royale shooter Realm Royale Reforged, until September 15.\nThe post Wine-making sim Hundred Days is free on the Epic Games Store appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "On a per-game basis\nWhile not as high-profile as 1440p output and folder-esque Game Lists, there's a somewhat buried new PlayStation 5 feature this week that will come in handy if you're constantly digging through your trophy lists. With a newly-added toggle, it's possible to \"automatically show information for all hidden trophies\" for any given PS5 game.\nInstead of inspecting each individual hidden trophy and pressing the Square button to show its name and criteria, you can now flip a switch for a game's entire trophy list.\nAs shown in my screenshot up top, you just need to head to your PS5 Trophies section and press the Options button while hovering over a game — you'll see a \"Reveal All\" toggle. This PS5-only feature was publicized by YouTuber Mystic (via True Trophies).\nI'll definitely be using this going forward (as long as I don't forget that it exists). I've never been one to care about my overall trophy count — I try to focus on games that are already clicking with me and then pursue the Platinum if it's remotely reasonable.\nIt's nice that game developers can tuck spoilers away inside hidden trophy descriptions, but plenty of people are just going to want to look them up right away, even before the first playthrough is finished. As always, options like this toggle are appreciated.\nAlso, yeah, I started playing the PS4 version of Resident Evil. It has been sloooow going.\nThe post PS5 has a new toggle to reveal all hidden trophies appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Explore what's behind the mysterious door for yourself\nAfter setting the NieR: Automata fandom ablaze with a mysterious door, modders have made it so you too can venture beyond. The mod behind the NieR church mystery is available to download right now.\nBack in July, a strange video caught on in the NieR community. One player said they had found a weird door in the Copied City section of NieR: Automata.\nWhat stemmed from there was a few days of feverish speculation and secret-hunting, up until the folks behind it revealed all. It was not a long-hidden secret or tease for a new Drakengard. It was, actually, a mod.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb_Xe1Y4m90\nDevolasRevenge and the others behind the project confirmed it was completely in-game, and no editing was used. To show it off, the team confirmed it was going to release it all.\nAnd sure enough, over on NexusMods, you can head over and download the NieR Automata Church right now.\nUploader DevolasRevenge recommends being around level 90 and removing chips like Overclock and Shock Wave. They also recommend the use of the NieR Automata Mod Helper, or NAMH, to install it.\nBoth NieR and far away\nSo while there isn't some giant secret at the end, it's at least an exciting development for NieR modders. The code's available to dig around in, and who knows? Maybe this will lead to some really cool stuff in the future. I was already floored by the use of the giant statues near the end of the video, and would love to see more like that made by the community.\nNier fans still have more to look forward to as well. The NieR: Automata anime is in production, and I've got some high hopes for that. And the Switch port of NieR: Automata is right around the corner too.\nThe post The NieR: Automata church mod is available to download now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Beating out Blu-ray, CDs, and other platforms\nThe Entertainment Retailer's Association (ERA) has issued statistics charting the UK sales of all \"entertainment products\" for 2022 so far — and it seems that the British public cannot get enough of Nintendo Switch games, with their physical iteration being the highest-grossing media available on the high street.\nBoxed Nintendo Switch titles have raked in a healthy £88.7 million (around $102m USD) in revenue since January 1, 2022, outselling PlayStation's PS4 & PS5 releases (£79.6 million) and Xbox One and Series releases (£17.8 million). Away from gaming, Switch titles even outsold other forms of physical media, including music CDs (£68.9 million), DVDs (£66.8 million), and Blu-rays (£52.1 million).\n\nInterestingly, vinyl album sales have skyrocketed, and sit in second place with a hefty revenue count of £79.6 million. This is somewhat understandable, as much of the entertainment scene has made the shift to digital formats, whereas vinyl collectors are highly unlikely to make such a move to the digital sphere. Oh, and also, vinyl albums cost a fucking fortune.\n\"Vinyl’s rise and rise seems unstoppable,\" notes ERA CEO Kim Bayley. \"For a 74-year-old analogue format to eclipse the digital-age technology of games platforms is quite extraordinary. 10 years into its long climb back to favour, the vinyl revival is most definitely here to stay.\"\nIronically, despite sitting on top of the pile, Nintendo Switch UK sales have actually decreased from last year, with sales down around 12% when compared to the same period in 2021. Of the aforementioned formats, only PlayStation games, Blu-ray, and vinyl saw any growth on the previous year's chart.\nThe post Nintendo Switch games are the UK’s best-selling entertainment product in 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Shhh, I'm trying to clutch\nThere's nothing better than gaming with a group of friends, but the more people you add to a party, the more chaotic and noisy it can be. Xbox has released a feature to try and mitigate some of the extra sounds in the background, thanks to a feature called party chat noise suppression. It's supposed to specifically help remove noises like buttons clicking on a controller and breathing, in addition to other unspecified background noise.\nHere's hoping it can block out the music my friends bump out loud while playing Call of Duty, but that feels like wishful thinking. This feature is coming exclusively to Xbox Series X/S consoles. Of course, you can also turn off noise suppression in the options menu by going to the guide, selecting Parties & Chats, then selecting Options, and finally untoggling noise suppression.\nXbox also says that while this feature is coming to Series X/S today, it'll be rolling out to other devices soon. We'll have to see what it turns out like in practice, but if it works well, I'm hoping PlayStation can get a similar feature soon, as it's my console of choice.\n\nIn the blog post announcing the noise suppression release, Xbox also highlighted another new feature: a button to jump right into a game from a shared capture on mobile and PC.\nBasically what this means is that when you or your friends share screenshots or gameplay clips with each other via link sharing, you will now have the option to launch the game in question at just a click of a button. Thanks to cloud gaming, you'll be able to start playing the game right there in your browser as well.\nThe one caveat is that some games require Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for cloud gaming, but other than that this seems like a convenient addition.\nThe post Xbox is rolling out party chat noise suppression appeared first on Destructoid.",

Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. \nWhile exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. \n“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” \nAs you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. \nThere’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown. \nAre you excited about a narrative-focused Battlefield game?

          "description": "Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. \nGrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. \nOnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. \n\n\nFans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment.

The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. \nMaybe one day we'll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.",

Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.\n1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. \nAs such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. \nYou can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):\nSplitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.",

It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: \n\nFor more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy.

Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours?

          "description": "In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",

The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists.

He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.\nKeep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),\nbut beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!\nScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.\nTo play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build.
