          "description": "Ma(rio) baker.\nIt’s been rough out there for Paper Mario fans. Over the past several entries Nintendo has tested new ideas that haven’t come together anywhere near as well as the original games did, and there's good reason for the joy surrounding the return of Thousand-Year Door in 2024. Some indie developers, however, have tried to recapture the magic of the original releases with titles such as Citizens of Space and Bug Fables. Many have even succeeded in recreating Paper Mario's look and feel while adding some cool new ideas, and now Wildarts Studio has served up its own take. Born of Bread is a cute and summery RPG following the adventures of a sentient bread boy. It has its issues, which we'll get into, but overall this is an enjoyable little RPG that we’d suggest you investigate.\nBorn of Bread’s story begins with a group of researchers messing around in some ancient ruins and accidentally resurrecting a group of evil beings from a long-forgotten empire, and they’re hellbent on collecting the magical Sunstones scattered across the land so they can bring back their master. Luckily, on the same night that this happens, the royal baker for the queen accidentally creates Loaf, a magical doughboy with a heart of gold and the potential to be a great hero.

          "description": "Othercide from French developer Lightbulb Crew is one of my favourite recent tactics RPGs. It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning units just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.\nBut I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the story and setting are relentlessly unpleasant, a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to fuel new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Two years ago, developers Fntastic debuted their \"open world survival MMO\" The Day Before with a fairly lengthy trailer (which has since been scrubbed from their official YouTube channel, but it's been preserved by IGN and Gamespot). It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.\nNow, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.\nRead more",

Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.\r\n\n\r\nFrom what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones.

Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. \nSo Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000.

It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.\nA spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her \"Ascend\" to the afterlife.\nRead more",

          "description": "In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. \nAt the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date. \nRead more",

There are many reasons to commemorate id Software's 1993 jaunt through the demon-infested corridors of Mars, from the fact that you can play it on every device known to man to its undying modding scene that even lets you pet Cacodemons. But I have a personal connection with Doom that's a bit special. It's the first game that made me so sick I wanted to puke.\nRead more",

I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.\nIn this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0. Here's the latest trailer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.\nYet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”\nRead more",

          "description": "“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. \nRPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Chill letter writing game Kind Words was a lofi hit back in 2019, encouraging players to share over 5 million anonymous notes of support and, well, kindness since launch.

We got the music ones out of the way like Apple and Spotify, so now it’s time for us gamers to bother our mutuals. PlayStation and Xbox have just now released their year-in-review wrap-up stats apps.\n\n\nBetween now and January 12, 2024, people who have played on the PS4 or PS5 consoles will be given a breakdown of what they did in 2023 regarding all things gaming. It’ll start with what your first game of the year was, then your most played games, highlighting your favorite genre of the year, and so forth. \n\n\nXbox players’ “Year in Review” will do basically the same, showing your overall playtime, showcasing your most played month, a piechart breakdown of genres from this year, and so forth. Graphics can be screenshotted for easy sharing on your preferred social media platforms. \n\n\n\n\nThese stats will keep updating until the end of 2023, so things might change!\n\n\nHow to see your year in review for Xbox or PlayStation\n\n\nFor PlayStation players, head over to wrapup.playstation.com and sign in with your Sony account. This can be accessed via mobile device or PC. You can revisit this page as many times as you like between now and when the event is over. You also do not need an active PS Plus subscription or any sort of additional things to view this.\n\n\nFor Xbox players, head over to xbox.com/year-in-review to check your stats. The same applies here as with PlayStation. Simply enter your login credentials and get a thorough breakdown of all your gaming activity on this platform in 2023. \n\nThe post PlayStation and Xbox year in review apps are live for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

They will be available for preorder on December 14 at 9am PST.\n\n\nIf you’re already deeply invested in owning the series’ soundtracks pressed in vinyl, your soul will feel incomplete without these two. Both the Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden albums appear to be supplemental single LP albums, containing only music unique to their versions of the game. The bulk of the tunes are already on the Persona 3 and Persona 4 vinyl releases, both of which weighed in on four discs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, if you’re looking for the most enduring songs from the two games, you’d probably be better off with the vanilla versions. Persona 4 Golden, for example, doesn’t include Heartbeat, Heartbreak, a song that has been playing on a loop inside my skull for about a decade.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t look like these two albums are going to fit in the Persona 25th Anniversary Slipcase. They will have to sit cold and alone beyond the embracing walls of the rest of the collection. On the positive, their covers are done by Drew Wise, a longtime contributor with Iam8bit and the artist who did all the 25th Anniversary covers.

          "description": "It's been eight years since developer MidBoss released 2064: Read Only Memories, but we're inching ever closer to a return to Neo-San Francisco. A new trailer arrived for Read Only Memories: Neurodiver with yet another updated release window, this time penciling the cyperpunk sequel in for sometime in the first half of 2024.\n\n\nWhen Neurodiver was first announced in June 2019, it was planned for a 2020 launch on PC and Mac. More platforms were added as the release window slipped further. It was moved to Q1 2021, then Q1 2022, and finally Q3 2023 before the latest jump to spring 2024. That release is currently set for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can see some of the characters, story, and inspiration behind the series in the trailer below, complete with narration from creative director John \"JJSignal\" James. \n\n\n\n\nNeurodiver has ES88 attempting to track down a rogue psychic known as Golden Butterfly, who is hiding in the memories of others and slowly corrupting them. With an ever-changing form, Golden Butterfly's motivation is a mystery. It's up to you to use your own psychic abilities and your genetically-engineered Neurodiver creature to connect with the fragmented memories, repair them, and ultimately put a stop to Golden Butterfly.\n\n\nThese events are set about five years after the story that went down in 2064. As such, there are a handful of returning cast members you'll get to reunite with, like Lexi and Tomcat. MidBoss is once again attempting to deliver a loving sendup to the Japanese adventure games of yore, and that love is particularly potent in the FM synth-infused soundtrack. If you want to sample it all while waiting for launch, the \"Pilot Memory\" demo is currently available on Steam. \n\nThe post Read Only Memories: Neurodiver eyes spring 2024 release, new trailer debuts appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Midwinter Blight brings with it a period of perpetual darkness and bitter cold that will consume all of Fractured Peaks. As part of the event, players can take on new event quests, upgrade the new event hub, challenge a new event-specific boss, and earn event-specific rewards including a bunch of new cosmetic items.\n\n\n\n\nA new character, Gileon the bard, seeks to reignite the holiday spirit of Kyovashad by enlisting the players help. The event-specific area, Midwinter Square, will allow players to build it up and upgrade it as they slay new Blightfiend enemies around the Fractured Peaks. Several new items can be used to progress the status of the Midwinter Square to unlock new rewards including a mount trophy, class-specific back trophies, weapon cosmetics, the Shard of the Dawn Offensive Legendary Aspect, Gileon's Brew, and more.\n\n\nPlayers can eventually also take on an event-specific boss, the Red-Cloaked Horror.\n\n\nIt looks like the event is only available on Seasonal realms, so those who are playing on the Eternal Realm won't be able to partake without creating a Seasonal character. It seems like an odd choice to not allow characters on the Eternal Realm to join the festive event, but there's probably a reason for it.\n\n\nThe Midwinter Blight event in Diablo 4 is live now and lasts through January 2.\n\n\n\nThe post The Diablo 4 Midwinter Blight event is live now appeared first on Destructoid.",

The free access event kicks off on December 14 and will last through December 18. Players will be able to jump in and have free access to six maps, four multiplayer modes, Modern Warfare Zombies, and three of the Ground War maps.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nThose interested in checking out the multiplayer will have plenty to try out. Here are the maps and modes that are part of the free event:\n\n\n\n6v6 Core Multiplayer Maps: Terminal, Rust, Highrise, Shipment, Afghan, Meat\n\n\nGround War Maps: Popov Power, Orlov Military Base, Levin Resort\n\n\nCore Modes: Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, Kill Confirmed, Ground War, War\n\n\nPlaylists: Rustment 24/7 (Shipment and Rust), War Mode, 6v6 Moshpit (featuring Highrise, Meat, Afghan, Terminal), Ground War, Modern Warfare Zombies\n\n\n\nOverall it's a nice mix of maps. Terminal, Rust, and Shipment are fan favorites, whereas the map Meat is a brand new map. Players will be able to level up very quickly via Rustment 24/7 which will allow them to check out some of the later-level unlocks to see if they like what is there.\n\n\nIt appears the full Modern Warfare Zombies mode will be included in the free access as well, which is worth checking out. Instead of traditional Zombies maps, MW3 features a DMZ/Warzone style open-world Zombies map.\n\n\nThe Call of Duty MW3 Free Access event begins on December 14 at 1 p.m. ET and will run through December 18 at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe post Call of Duty: MW3 multiplayer and zombies are both free this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Well, it's been about a hundredth of a femtosecond, let's see what people are trying to port Doom onto now. Oh my, would you look at that! It appears as though it's possible to get id Software's iconic FPS to \"run\" on cells.\n\n\nIn a meeting of technology and biology, PhD student Lauren \"Ren\" Ramlan at MIT (as shared by Reddit user AnNdPh) has figured out a way to use E. coli cells to sort of run Doom. Now, I'm not scientifically minded, so I don't fully understand how they do it.\n\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell: what they've been able to do is tweak or modify the cells to – for want of a better term – turn them into monitor pixels. This has then allowed them to display the game in a very rudimentary way.\n\n\nI hope you have half a millennium to spare\n\n\nWhile this means the E. coli cells are technically displaying the game rather than actually running it, it's still impressive to see Doom being ported in this way.\n\n\nRen also notes that the game is only able to run at one frame every 8.33 hours. Using this figure, they estimate it would take around 600 years to complete it in its entirety. Even the likes of Skyrim can't compete with that kind of longevity.\n\n\nWith the original Doom recently celebrating its 30th anniversary, the legacy of the iconic shooter continues unabated. One can't help wonder where the FPS genre would be without the 1993 release, but one's thing for sure, no one's running Call of Duty on E. coli cells.\n\nThe post PhD student tries to get Doom running on cells appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sinister Statues is the name of a new mod for Elden Ring that uses a page from the Doctor Who playbook to make combat in the game more terrifying than ever. \n\n\nThe mod essentially turns every enemy into a Weeping Angel by making them entirely immobile whenever they’re observed. From basic mobs to major bosses, everyone is frozen in place as long as you’re looking at them. Sounds like it would make the game a lot easier, right?\n\n\nWell, to be fair, it probably does. In a video showing off the mod, its creator acknowledges that this hasn’t been designed for balance and is really just meant to provide a brand new way to experience the game. But that’s not to say a Sinister Statues playthrough is as easy as walking backward while locking eyes with an enemy. \n\n\n\n\nDon't blink\n\n\nThe mod also adds a new blinking mechanic to the game, which forces you to approach combat in a new way. Every so often your character will blink, turning the screen black and letting enemies swarm you. The lower your health, the longer a single blink takes. You can try to resist blinking by holding down the interact button, but that won’t last forever. Eventually your screen will go dark, and you’d better be far away from any enemies when that happens. \n\n\nThe mod is designed to work alongside almost any other Elden Ring mod. If you want to play in first person, with randomized items, or with any other combination of add-ons, it should work. The only real restriction is that it doesn’t currently function with multiplayer mods. \n\n\nThis is great news for anyone looking to spice up their next playthrough. We’re all still desperately waiting for more news of Shadow of the Erdtree, the upcoming Elden Ring DLC. FromSoftware hasn’t given us a release date yet, but the modding community keeps providing reasons to come back to Elden Ring in the meantime. \n\nThe post Elden Ring has a new mod based off of Doctor Who’s Weeping Angels, and it’s terrifying appeared first on Destructoid.",

While Nightdive Studios updated and rereleased the PC versions of the first two games, there wasn’t a PC version of Turok 3. They didn't have the source files, so they had to reverse-engineer the N64 version and port it over to their proprietary KEX Engine.\n\n\nIt’s a lot of work to go through, especially when Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is hardly the best game in the series. To put it charitably, it’s mediocre. Neither liquid nor solid. Remastering it was hardly going to be a financial home run.\n\n\nBut, as I said in my review, “It wasn’t the smart thing to do.

Supposedly a comprehensive upgrade to the middle-of-the-road original, House Flipper 2 is about to prove its worth.\n\n\nThe developer, Frozen District, appears to be quite certain of House Flipper 2's quality on day one, December 14. Essentially a game about flipping old, downtrodden houses (in this economy?), House Flipper 2 offers an upgraded feature roster compared to its immediate predecessor. Its most interesting draw? The ability to build houses from the ground-up, if you so desire. \n\n\nImage via Frozen District\n\n\nHouse Flipper 2 releases on December 14\n\n\nOf course, the reviews for House Flipper 2 are pending still, and there's currently no telling whether Frozen District's new offering will outmatch what came before. Yet, the competition in this highly specific simulator niche is basically nil, so all prospective (virtual) house flippers will at least consider a bid on the $39.99 title.\n\n\nThe good news for those who are curious about House Flipper 2, but uncertain whether it's a good investment, is that Frozen District aims to host a 2-hour developer livestream. The stream will be going live at 4 PM CET, and it makes for a perfect opportunity to check the game out without any fuss.\n\n\nFinally, the developer has also announced that House Flipper 2 players can expect a big Community Contest shortly after the game's release. \"We're proud to let you know that in the following days, we will present a ruleset, a list of exclusive rewards, as well as a theme for the first official House Flipper 2 Community Contest, and it is going to be focused around building your own house project,\" wrote Frozen District. \n\n\nA promising start, perhaps, but it remains to be seen whether House Flipper 2 is truly up to the task.\n\nThe post House Flipper 2 launches this week, lets you live out the homeownership fantasy appeared first on Destructoid.",

Speaking of DayZ, the Soviet-inspired, zombie apocalypse game continues to be a shining beacon in the genre, with the developer acknowledging its success.\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter/X, Bohemia Interactive posted a statement that looks back at the history of DayZ since its journey began in 2013. The statement talks about the \"boundless efforts, resources, and man-hours\" that have been poured into the game and how, ten years later, it remains \"undefeated.\"\n\n\n\n\nHowever, one thing that stands out is how similar the post is to the one Fntastic uploaded recently regarding The Day Before. Both statements have a similar vibe, but with DayZ's ending with the words \"dead game\" being crossed out, is this Bohemia throwing shade?\n\n\nKicking them when they're down\n\n\nSome commenting have made it clear they think the DayZ post is \"savage\" and \"brutal,\" suggesting that this may have been a deliberate dig at The Day Before. Most, however, seem to be getting a kick out of the joke aimed at a now-dead studio.\n\n\nRegardless of intent, DayZ remains one of the best open-world post-apocalyptic survival games on the current market. It raises the question of whether we'll see an uptick now that Fntastic has closed its doors for good.\n\n\nSteamDB shows that DayZ experienced an all-time player peak just last month. And with 51,459 people playing in the last 24 hours, we might see Bohemia Interactive's game pick up some of that Day Before slack.\n\nThe post While The Day Before failed, DayZ remains triumphant ten years later appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "What a year it's been. We've seen a host of terrific games come out (and some not-so-terrific ones), with ups and downs across the board. But what's interesting is seeing which specific games people were searching for in 2023.\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by Geoff Keighley on social media, this year saw some pretty notable names cropping up on Google Trends summary of this year. In the top ten for this year, Hogwarts Legacy goes down as the most searched-for game on the site.\n\n\nAs praised as it was, some may be surprised it's at number one, especially as it wasn't nominated for any categories at this year's Game Awards.\n\n\nBelow that is The Last of Us. Again, this might seem like a bit of a surprise, but the recent HBO show – which won Best Adaptation – may have given it a bit of a signal boost.\n\n\nThe surprises keep coming\n\n\nSpeaking of Game Award winners, there's no sign of Alan Wake 2 on the Google list, despite the hype and subsequent accolades. Whether this is because the game only came out recently is something to perhaps consider.\n\n\nI must admit, I'm surprised to see Atomic Heart at number nine. That game seemed to come and go with only a brief spot in the limelight. I haven't even heard of Connections and Suika Game, the latter of which has been out since 2021, but only made its way to the west this year.\n\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind that this does consist of search terms on a global scale, so seeing something unfamiliar is perhaps to be expected.\n\n\nIt's hard to know what to make of the list, though. This is, after all, what people have searched for on Google. Still, the fact that Spider-Man or Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom aren't on there is a bit of a chin scratcher. But bless, Starfield made it. Good for it, I guess.\n\nThe post Hogwarts Legacy and Last of Us were the most searched-for games on Google in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you’re not the PS5 type, the Xbox and PC demos will arrive on December 21.\n\n\nExcited about Tekken 8, but the January 26, 2024 launch date is too far away? Lace up your fighting… fists, you’ll be able to get an early taste soon. How much of a taste? That’s not really said. In fact, I gave you pretty much all the facts we have in the first paragraph. There’s a demo. It’s out soon.\n\n\nTekken 8 is the first new game in the series since Tekken 7 launched in arcades in 2015, followed by a home release in 2017. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it features an impressive cast of 32 characters, most of which are returning favorites, while a few are new characters (or a variation of one in Jack-8’s case.)\n\n\nI’ve always played fighting games, but I’ve never really been a fighting gamer. I remember when Tekken was huge on the PS1. As a launch title, Tekken Tag Tournament was elevated to near-mythical status for a while. I’ve played them, but never to any really deep extent. I was more stuck on Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. These days, I’m mainly holding onto hope that we’ll one day get a new Bloody Roar, but with the state that fighting games are in right now, it doesn’t seem too friendly to any series that isn’t already massively successful. If it ever was. Plus, it’s now owned by Konami, so that’s a problem.\n\n\nTekken 8 releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 26, 2024. The PS5 demo arrives on December 14, 2023, followed by PC and Xbox on December 21, 2023.\n\nThe post Tekken 8 demo poised to launch on December 14 on PS5, Xbox and PC afterward appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Brush up your resume, as Playtonic friends and Canteen have announced that the absolutely normal job simulator, CorpoNation: The Sorting Project, will be released on February 22, 2024. Alongside this announcement is a new trailer.\n\n\nCorpoNation is a job simulator not too far off from the seminal Papers, Please. However, instead of sorting paperwork at the border in a bleak dystopia, CorpoNation has you sorting genetic samples in a bleak Corporate dystopia. It's probably the same corporate dystopia that we’ll be living in about three years from now. Might as well start practicing!\n\n\n\n\nCorpoNation differentiates itself from Papers, Please by also having you experience life outside of the workplace, which I assume is just a dorm for employees. There’s a virtual desktop with games you can play and instant messages you can read. It almost feels like actual human contact. However, there are still shades of its inspiration through narrative concepts like an underground resistance trying to recruit you to undermine your employer.\n\n\nI’m kind of looking forward to CorpoNation, but at times it feels too real. Hopefully, it’s more than a depressingly exaggerated extrapolation of “drive this car to work, work to pay for the car.” I’m hoping that there’s some fun in undermining your employer instead of the constant, clawing stress and anxiety that came with Papers, Please. I’m not sure my mind can take that sort of trauma again.\n\n\nCorpoNation is coming out on PC on February 22, 2024. There’s a demo available for it now if you’re interested in taking it for a test drive.\n\nThe post Nightmarish job simulator CorpoNation arrives February 22 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Anyone who's been keeping an eye on the news will have seen the amount of layoffs and closures that have happened. Numbers estimate that around 9,000 jobs have been lost in 2023.\n\n\nThat's according to Game Industry Layoffs (as spotted by VGC), a website that's been tracking the figures since January. The most recent entry as of the time of publication is for December 8, revealing that indie developer Triple Topping Games lost around 10 employees.\n\n\nImage via Game Industry Layoffs.\n\n\nUnity saw the most losses, with three entries on the list totaling 1,165 job losses; a significant chunk of the ~9,000 being shown. Looking at the list really hammers home just how bad things have been this year, with some notable names cropping up multiple times.\n\n\n[Shakes fist at Embracer Group]\n\n\nThe website will no doubt be updating its information soon, given that The Day Before studio has just announced it's closing for good. Given the unanimous negative feedback of its long-awaited post-apocalyptic game, some may not be too sorry to see the developer go.\n\n\nHowever, for the most part, it's been sad to see so many people in the video game industry lose their jobs. Very recently, it was confirmed that Embracer was closing down TimeSplitters studio Free Radical Design. As a result, fans are left certain that the dormant FPS series will no longer be getting a revival.\n\n\nWith AAA and independent companies seeing losses in 2023, it feels like an uncertain time to be a developer. The fact that layoffs have affected the likes of Twitch shows that even those not directly involved in video game production aren't safe.\n\nThe post Around 9,000 video game jobs were lost in 2023, estimates say appeared first on Destructoid.",

Only this time, it’s on motorized bikes. Then you see it, and you realize Cool Riders is one of the least cool games to exist.\n\n\nLet me back up a sec here. Cool Riders is absolutely one of the best retro games I’ve been introduced to this year. It’s a year where I feel something finally snapped in my head, and I’ve come to legitimately enjoy a lot of kusoge. But the thing about Cool Riders is that it certainly looks like kusoge, but it doesn’t play like it. \n\n\nIt’s sort of a Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game situation.

          "description": "If you're looking for a more constructive way to deal with a ruined wasteland, Terra Nil now has a date for Nintendo Switch. Devolver Digital is bringing the eco-strategy game from developer Free Lives (BroForce) to Nintendo's platform on December 18.\n\n\nTerra Nil previously made the rounds on PC, iOS, and Android (via Netflix) back in March. Devolver Digital shared a quick trailer to go along with the Switch news.\n\n\n\n\nIn Terra Nil, players are tasked with doing the opposite of what your average city- or world-builder requires. Rather than constant growth and expansion, you have to take a ruined world, breathe life back into it, and make like a tree and leave. This results in a short and sweet experience that brings something new to the table with a side of some much-needed optimism. \n\n\nDuring your time with Terra Nil you'll encounter a few different biomes, each of which is procedurally generated. You'll assist with ruined cities, volcanic glaciers, and more, including alternate levels that act as unlockables. There's something innately serene about helping the world start over again, and it's fitting that you'll ultimately leave it all to thrive on its own as if you were never there in the first place. \n\n\nAt the time of this writing, the reverse city builder is just due out digitally via the Nintendo eShop. If you're looking to take some time to wind down and bring a lifeless world back from the brink, this is the best way to reclaim the wasteland. \n\nThe post Eco-strategy game Terra Nil aims to thrive on Switch starting December 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "To this day, I love getting together with my buddies and having a jam session in Rock Band 4. So when Epic Games announced Fortnite Festival, I was hyped. But upon finding out there wasn't support for our plastic guitars and drums, not so much.\n\n\nLuckily, Epic Games knows that there are plenty of would-be rockers out there just waiting to jam out in a new way. And the publisher confirmed that for the dozens of us, implementing peripheral support is a \"priority.\"\n\n\n\n\nWithin a Q&A style posting on the Fortnite website, the development team addressed several topics. When asked \"Does Fortnite Festival support instrument controllers?\" the development confirmed that compatibility isn't available at launch. However, the team stated \"it's a priority for the team and currently under development. We'll have more to share in 2024.\"\n\n\nEpic Games purchased Harmonix (the developers of the Rock Band series and several of the original Guitar Hero games) in November 2021. Fortnite Festival appears to be the lovechild of that marriage.\n\n\nHarmonix was still an independent studio when they released Rock Band 4 in 2015. At the time, they partnered with Mad Catz to manufacture a fresh set of instruments for the series' fourth installment. But production on those instruments ceased years ago, and now they're very hard to find in the wild or extremely expensive to purchase used online.\n\n\nNow that Harmonix is backed by a financial juggernaut like Epic Games, the big question is whether the publisher will manufacture a new set of peripherals to sell to fans. Otherwise, anyone who wants to purchase a second-hand guitar, drum set, or keyboard is likely to have to spend a pretty penny.\n\nThe post Fortnite Festival getting instrument controller support is a ‘priority’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "At first it was a rumor, then it was news, and now it’s a reality. The recently revived Free Radical appears to have closed down today, another loss in Embracer Group’s ongoing campaign of shutdowns and layoffs.\n\n\nWhile the original iteration of Free Radical filed for bankruptcy in 2008, it was partially revived as Crytek UK and later Dambuster Studios. However, in 2021, Embracer Group rounded up much of the key staff from the pre-bankruptcy days – including Steve Ellis and David Doak – and re-established Free Radical to work on reviving the TimeSplitters series. Now, before we even see any fruits from their labor, they’ve been shut down again.\n\n\nAs of now, Free Radical’s former webpage shows a very particular 404 message. Rather than a simple “Page not found,” it instead displays “404 Company Not Found :-(.” Meanwhile, artists Mark Normington and Adam Kiraly have said farewell to the company on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\nThe sheer amount of layoffs this year has made it difficult to be enthusiastic about the industry. For me, the loss of Free Radical hits pretty hard. I can still remember the day a friend of mine introduced me to TimeSplitters 2 on GameCube. We marveled at the level of detail and ate up the cooperative campaign. Later, in college, my group of friends would gather around Timesplitters: Future Perfect to cook up the strangest game modes. One particular hit was turning on one-hit kills and setting all the weapons to bricks and bats.\n\n\nEmbracer Group chose to expand rapidly during the Coronavirus pandemic and is now quickly contracting as the industry and the market as a whole seem to be contracting in terms of investment. As a result, Embracer Group has cut more than 900 jobs, with more reportedly forthcoming. This is during a year that has been exhaustingly rife with job losses.\n\nThe post TimeSplitters studio Free Radical Design looks to be closing its doors today appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the game recently celebrating its 25th anniversary, Valve's FPS is enjoying a bit more time in the limelight. To ago along with that, the community is working on a way to challenge players.\n\n\nOver on ModDB, user jonnymartini is in the midst of looking for volunteers. The project, which is in the early stages of development, will add a few changes to the original Half-Life. For example, there are plans to introduce a new story element. In this scenario, Gordon will miss the train that takes him to Black Mesa at the start.\n\n\nImage via jonnymartini/ModDB.\n\n\nThis will change things up, but will also allow for some other areas to be re-explored, such as from the training section or the Decay expansion.\n\n\nGive 'em hell, Gordon!\n\n\nBut that's not all. The mod will be introducing new challenge modes to really test Gordon Freeman's might and gumption. There are five that have been outlined:\n\n\n\nCrowbar only\n\n\nGlock only\n\n\n1HP only\n\n\nRealistic mode (which will add realistic injuries, weapon classes, and more)\n\n\nPermadeath.\n\n\n\nWhether there'll be more challenges added cannot be said at this stage, but as I say, it's still early days. Currently, there's no release date for the mod, so you'll need to keep an eye on the download page for updates.\n\n\nHailed as one of the greatest FPS releases in gaming history, Half-Life has stood the test of time.

It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/review/terra-nil/a-new-approach-to-saving-the-world\">read&nbsp;<em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Terra Nil review</a> to learn what we thought about it.

Your goal is to defend the planet from invaders called Colossi using the game's third-person shooting and RPG mechanics. The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.</p>\n\n<p>There's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Check it out for free when it launches simultaneously on all of those platforms in Summer 2024.</p>",

We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.</p>\n\n<p>But the best part of the new trailer?

One, the game is getting an expansion. Two, it drops next week. And three, it's free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The expansion, called Valhalla, will be totally free. We see Kratos and Mimir traveling to an unknown where he battles the usual Norse creatures but also threats from his past, such as cyclops and undead Greek soldiers.

Most notably, it features actor&nbsp;Matthew McConaughey, famous for his roles in&nbsp;<em>True Detective</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dazed &amp; Confused</em>. And while he announced the game on-stage at the show, interestingly, the trailer didn't even feature&nbsp;McConaughey.</p>\n\n<p>Judging by quick looks in the reveal, Exodus is a third-person action adventure. Its main narrative conceit revolves around an alien discovery and a couple experiencing time at different intervals. As the trailer's narrator says, \"It was only days for me, but an entire lifetime passed for her.\"</p>\n\n<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkbPhbyPWCk\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Exodus is the first project from Archetype Entertainment.</p>",

Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
