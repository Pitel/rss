It sounds too much like Rita from down the chip shop, who might ask if you want salt and vinegar with that; or Rita from round the corner, who may or may not be a juvenile delinquent wearing altogether too much makeup. That said, Rita, the witch-like antagonist of the Power Rangers team, definitely doesn’t work in the chip shop. Too much makeup on the other hand…\nPower Rangers: Rita’s Rewind is a brand new belt-scrolling beat 'em up from Digital Eclipse, a developer better known for their retro remasters and collections in the form of Atari 50 and the recent Tetris Forever. Based on the original '90s incarnation of the show — a Japanese-American co-production that mish-mashed Japan’s Super Sentai action scenes with US-filmed actors — Power Rangers is a logical candidate to join the 2D scrolling beat-'em-up renaissance.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate.

          "description": "If Space Marine 2's wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.\n Read more",

But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.\nRead more",

These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. \r\n\nYet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches!

It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly.

As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. \"It’s fine\", I decided. \"It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me.

Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way?

Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones. \r\n\n \nRead more",

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.\nNow, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.\nRead more",

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed \"Queen\" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old \"danchi\" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI. \r\n \nRead more",

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

          "description": "“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.\nJames already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.\nRead more",

If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.\nCyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap.

With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks.

          "description": "As a resident of Brick Life, you must do your part by keeping the city clean. This requires you to take out the trash every once in a while, whether for tasks or to simply make it nice and tidy. Here's how to clean trash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.\n\n\nHow to clean trash or throw something out in Brick Life\n\n\nYou may have trouble finding litter when you begin the 'Clean Trash or Throw Something Out' task in Brick Life. I ran into this issue initially, especially since waste will be pretty hidden. The main thing you need to look for is trash cans that have a bag on top of it. Their locations will be randomized, but I've had the most luck finding them near Durr Burger.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Durr Burger Line Cook job features a trash-based mission, which is likely why the litter frequently appears there. You can try other locations to see if waste pops up. However, remember that trash cans without bags have already been cleaned, so there's no need to interact with them.\n\n\nIf you haven't found a suitable trash can, you can choose the second option: throwing something out. Grab anything you don't need, like a piece of paper or a ticket. You can collect plenty of items around town, making this objective much more manageable. Then, approach any trash area to throw it out.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUpon successfully completing the Clean Trash task in Brick Life, you'll be rewarded with 500 cash in your pocket. This is just one of the many ways to earn money in the game, besides the ATM and job objectives. Use your hard-earned cash to upgrade your home lots or get a Hoverboard.\n\nThe post How to clean trash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I can't speak for everyone, of course, but when I play Skyrim, I seldom stop to admire the wildlife that frolics throughout this cold slice of Tamriel anymore. I think I've just played the game so much that I've gradually become numb to any visual allure. But with the power of modding, I can learn to truly appreciate TES5 once more.\n\n\nThanks to Nexus Mods user shadowman2777, I can now sleep with a cow. No, no. Not like that. Please try to focus here. I mean, \"Sleep With Any Cow Shout\" is a way of chilling with a fellow bovine creature while out and about in Skyrim.\n\n\nImage via shadowman2777 / Nexus Mods.\n\n\nIf you just want to kick back with a furry wild beast (again, drag your mind out of the gutter), you can employ this custom Shout, which will allow you to cuddle up to any cow you target. Why would you want to do this? Why are you being so judgmental, is my rebuttal.\n\n\nFus-Cow-Dah!\n\n\nSeriously, look how chilled out the guy in the image above looks, craning his neck to feel rested against the animal's stomach. Ignore the well-endowed woman in the neon pink cocktail dress who's standing nearby. I'm sure she's not related to the mod.\n\n\nOh, there is one thing I should probably say. While, yes, there are cows in Skyrim, they don't appear like the ones in the images shared by shadowman2777 on Nexus. This is because – according to the description – this mod seems to require another download: \"FNIS Creatures.\" I'm not sure if this is for the animations or these particular types of cows. In any case, if you need it, you can download if from here.\n\n\nBy now, you should all have enough Skyrim mods installed to make the aging RPG look like a different game entirely. No, but seriously, if Bethesda doesn't let us mod The Elder Scrolls 6 by improving the visuals, adding custom quests, or changing the names of the Frost Trolls to Tim Allen for some reason, what even is the point?\n\nThe post Time to cuddle cows with this Skyrim mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When riding around LEGO Fortnite Brick Life's city in style, your best options are cars or hoverboards. While you can certainly use a taco or ice cream truck, there's something satisfying about hovering on a skateboard or sports car from point A to B.\n\n\nWhere to buy a Hoverboard in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life\n\n\nPurchasing a hoverboard in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life requires opening your phone, heading into the Vehicles menu, and going into the app's shopping menu. While your list of cars is in the cardboard box section, the shop is shown with a shopping cart icon, with the hoverboard listed for 3,000 cash.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn short, while it's inexpensive compared to other vehicles in the shopping menu, it's still pricier than home furniture. You'll need to work a few jobs or hop into the bank vault real quick to make some quick cash before making your next car purchase.\n\n\nOnce you purchase the hoverboard, it'll be available to use anytime through the cardboard box section of your vehicles menu. Fortunately, if you log out of Brick Life, you'll have to respawn it, but it won't disappear forever. \n\n\nSimilarly, if Epic Games introduces more hoverboards in future updates, you'll be able to find those in the same menus. While the prices may differ, their functionality will likely remain the same.\n\n\nis the Hoverboard faster than cars?\n\n\nOverall, the hoverboard isn't much faster than your default Style Utility Vehicle or other cars of similar size and speed. After driving both for about 30 seconds, I found they traveled similar distances, with the Style Utility car being a few seconds quicker for short distances. \n\n\nIf you're looking for significant speed increases, the hoverboard isn't for you. It does look cool, though, so you'll at least look stylish while cruising around Brick Bay. \n\nThe post How to get a Hoverboard in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can pay some Robux to change your faction, or you can wait for Delirum (the perma-death mode which happens every hour), die during the event, and then, hopefully, get reborn as the other faction.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou'll have different things to do depending on which faction you play as, but if there's one thing that applies to both of them, it's to kill everything in site.

Although you won't be able to make millions of this right away, you can easily make several thousand an hour just by picking up a few items. \n\n\nHow to find the bank in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life\n\n\nYour first goal is to find the bank, known in-game as Vaulted Value Propositions. You'll find it on the northern part of Brick Bay near RoboRoll Sushi and Meowswole's Gym. You can drive here with a car or hoverboard or run here on foot if you're nearby.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou'll find the vault in the bank's basement. You can also pick up the banker or security guard jobs if you want to fight against those trying to steal money. Otherwise, you can run in without much issue, and there's no penalty for trying to take some cash from the vault.\n\n\nHow to enter the bank vault in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life\n\n\nEntering the vault requires entering garbage chutes around the bank. You'll find several of these in the building, including upstairs in Midas' room with the Security System hacking terminal. You can also find a safe in this room if you want to pick up a gemstone before diving into the vault.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUpon entering the chute, your character will jump down and teleport into the vault, giving you full access to the bank's riches. In this room, you'll see a cart full of cash and gold bars, which you can interact with to grab $500 and a sack of cash. \n\nThe post How to break into the vault in Brick Life Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Čekal jsem od Hugha Granta v roli chlípného starce hodně, a i přesto jsem byl příjemně překvapen. Je skvělý. Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)",

          "description": "Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.\n\n\nExistuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně \"zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!\" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A \"nevíme jak\" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…",
