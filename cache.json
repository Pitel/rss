According to an announcement from the team at Evo, Nintendo has decided to withdraw Super Smash Bros. from the event.

          "description": "\"I’ve always viewed Zelda: Minish Cap as the height of pixel art\".\nThe list of games overtly inspired by Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise isn't small, but it's nevertheless impressive to see what some of the smallest development teams, in particular, can achieve. Ocean's Heart is a recent example on the Switch eShop, a game that's been upfront in acknowledging its sources of inspiration.\nWith attractive pixel-based visuals and plenty to discover in its world, we gave Ocean's Heart a recommendation in our review. Most impressively, though, it's largely the work of a solo developer, Max Mraz. The core game was a one-person endeavour, though its path to Switch has been an interesting one too, as it's a trailblazer for the Solarus engine, which has been used for a significant number of Zelda fangames. Ocean's Heart is the first time that engine has been utilised on Nintendo's hardware; it was also the first game using the engine to be released on Steam.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There were interesting reveals, though, with Capcom Fighting Collection in particular getting plenty of retro gamers hot under the collar. Meanwhile it was confirmed that Next Level Games has been working on the new Mario Strikers, and that imposter Elden Ring started jostling with Super Mario Odyssey for critical supremacy - the cheek! In lighthearted news we saw a Star Wars droid turned into the coolest Game Boy accessory ever, and we enjoyed the realisation that the Nintendo 64DD had more online features than Switch.\nNow it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans.

Unfortunately, it didn't go down so well - our own hands-on noted how the game's performance was \"disappointing\".\nIf you were a bit worried about the game's performance at the time, Ramone Russel - the product development communications and brand strategist for MLB The Show - has explained how the tech test is about two weeks old, and it's not \"exactly 100%\" optimised.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Evidently, Gust thought so too, as it decided to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series not with the inevitable conclusion of the Secret trilogy, but with a rather unexpected sequel starring Sophie. We’re glad it went with that choice, as Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream is a fantastic new entry blending open-ended design, charming aesthetics, and compelling crafting systems into one must-have package.\nThose of you who didn’t play the first Atelier Sophie (which is available on Switch eShop in 'DX' form) need not worry about the story, as there’s a helpful recap you can watch if you want to get caught up on the broad strokes. Sophie 2 is set just after that game and before Atelier Firis, filling in some plot details that were previously left vague and creating more connections between those two titles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions.

That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.\r\n\n\r\nWhile indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering.

And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset.

Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018.

Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. \r\n\n\r\nSo it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks. \r\n\n \nRead more",

No, not the added story mode, it’s more fundamental than that; it’s the handling. It just didn’t feel quite right in the last game, whereas here it’s arguably the most playable handling system of any modern racer that doesn’t have ‘Kart’ in its title. Even though your car slides at every opportunity, it’s actually disguising the fact there’s a great deal of grip here, making for an enjoyable experience whatever your skill level.\nRead more",

As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.\nBut Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. \"Visions of joy\" sums it up nicely.\nRead more",

All the T-posed NPCs, floataway physics bugs and crashes-to-desktop would be lost in time, like tears in rain. What remained was the deep appreciation I had for its story and characters, and a longing to revisit Night City.\nSo I have. After last week's patch 1.5 promised more fixes, a refreshed perk tree and improved AI, I wondered if I might finally be able to champion the first-person RPG without caveats. The answer is not a simple yes or no - but the list of caveats is definitely a lot shorter.\nRead more",

I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence. But I understand it’s viewed as a faux-fancy chain for people who think Al Dente was the name of the man who invented spaghetti, and not somewhere you’d want to earnestly praise as a quote unquote ‘serious critic’.\r\n\n\r\nBig Tones was having none of it. He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews. A class act, no doubt. And it’s this championing of the everyman gourmand, this deep passion for non-exclusionary, unpretentious foodie culture, that powers Total War: Warhammer 3’s most joyfully silly campaign experience.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's weird to remember that Rainbow Six Siege was initially a bit of a flop. But rather than shrug and instantly release a sequel, for once Ubisoft kept working on the multiplayer tactical FPS with updates and overhauls, and today it boasts PC player numbers four times higher than launch. Over the weekend, Ubisoft laid out their plans for Year 7 of content updates, including brand new maps for the first time in years.\nRead more",

I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. \nAs you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place.

Syscrusher was a very brief but smooth and exciting shooter, and Stowaway an atmospheric monster horror. Their new game, Kingdom Of The Dead, combines the two; a striking fast paced FPS about a... paranormal vigilante cowboy, I think? It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.\nYou're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in. Interesting as the premise is, it's really about blasting around some fun environments for a few hours, and I've enjoyed it more with every level.\nRead more",

Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. \nReally though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections. \nRead more",

Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. \nThe next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles. \nRead more",

          "description": "Grey is in. Don't take it from me, take it from the Carpet Man. I had to buy new carpet recently, and Carpet Man told me that the only shade of carpet anyone wants nowadays is grey, resting one hand on his hip and the other on a pile of pile. He seemed weary, but livened up as I picked through some beige.\nEventually I decided on corn, a warm yellow to keep things light and breezy. To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on. One that tires Carpet Man and reminds me of Lost Ark, an MMO that's supremely popular for some reason. No matter how chic it may be right now, I can't see it being a permanent fixture in my life.\nRead more",

          "description": "Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.\r\n\n\r\n“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”\r\n\n\r\nLarian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Now, halfway through the series, we reach one of the more divisive entries: Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.  \nDeveloped by Naughty Dog, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console on November 1, 2011. After the success of Uncharted 2 and it's blockbuster setpieces, Naughty Dog upped the stakes and pushed to include even more spectacular action moments. Unfortunately, that put a toll on development. In this episode, we talk about Uncharted 3's renewed focus on melee combat, how Last of Us' development impacted the team, and why Uncharted 3 almost shipped with a game-breaking bug. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and co-founder and the CEO of Kinda Funny Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's third outing.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

The device can’t play every title and Steam recently rolled out new library categories to better label which of your games work on the Deck and which don’t. Publisher THQ Nordic has assisted on this front by revealing which of its many titles are playable on Steam Deck at launch.  \nIn a press release, THQ has listed the following titles as Steam Deck Verified. That means they’re fully functional on the handheld:\nDarksiders II Deathinitive Edition\nDarksiders Genesis\nDesperados III\nThis is the Police 2\nThe next batch of titles is Steam Deck Playable. This is a step below Verified status because while these games work on the device, they may require some manual tweaking to get them running at full capacity:\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar\nBiomutant\nDarksiders: Warmastered Edition\nDestroy All Humans! (2020)\nElex\nExpeditions: Rome\nMX vs ATV All Out\nSpongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated\nThis is the Police\nThere are currently over 300 titles confirmed to be playable on Steam Deck and that number will grow as Valve and developers work to get games running on the handheld. Other confirmed titles include Persona 4, Dota 2, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Inscryption, and Valheim. \nAre you getting your hands on a Steam Deck today? Let us know in the comments!",

The nature of that appeal is quite different depending on your perspective. Some primarily console-focused gamers may find a low-cost entry into at least part of the PC gaming experience. For more dedicated PC players, it provides a chance to take what may already be an extensive Steam library on the go – albeit with only specific titles optimized right now. Either way, the Steam Deck is an impressive first step into a promising future of portable PC play – with some significant issues holding it back from greatness.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nThe Steam Deck is big.

As the world watches this historical (and frankly, terrifying) event unfold, efforts have begun to help aid civilians caught in the crossfire. That includes 11Bit Studios, makers of the acclaimed 2014 anti-war survival game, This War of Mine. \n11Bit, a Polish studio, has announced it is heavily discounting This War of Mine, its expansion and console port The Little Ones, and its DLC across all platforms for the next week. The game is currently 75-8o% off, dropping it down to $4.99 on Steam and $3.99 on consoles. 100 percent of the profits made during this sale will form a fund that will be donated to the Ukrainian Red Cross. In This War of Mine, players oversee and care for a group of civilian survivors of a devastating conflict in a commentary of the horrors of war. You can read 11Bit’s full statement below. \n11 Bit isn’t the first European Studio to condemn the attacks. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 developer GSC Game World, which is based in Ukraine, posted its own call for support, saying in part:\nIf you want to help our neighbors overseas, you can donate directly to the Ukrainian Red Cross here.",

          "description": "Sony has asked a court to dismiss a class-action lawsuit against it first filed in November of last year that alleges gender discrimination within the company. \nFormer Sony IT security analyst, Emma Majo, sought court approval to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit last year on behalf of other women who worked for the company in the past. She alleged that “Sony discriminates against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men,” as reported by Axios last year. \nNow, Sony is asking a court to dismiss Majo’s class-action case against it, citing a lack of facts to support the claims presented in the lawsuit, Axios reports. \n“Despite the sweeping breadth of her lawsuit, the allegations in which [Sony Interactive Entertainment] categorically denies, she fails to plead facts to support either her individual claims or the claims of the broad-based classes of women she seeks to represent,” Sony’s lawyer wrote, according to court documents. \nFurthermore, Sony writes in documents that Majo failed to “identify a single policy, practice, or procedure at SIE that allegedly formed the basis of any widespread intentional discrimination or had a discriminatory impact on women,” and that Majo’s “widespread claims of harassment are based solely on unactionable allegations of run-of-the-mill personnel activity.” \nSony also asks the court to recognize what it calls a conflict of interest, too. Majo’s lawsuit includes an attempt to include all women who worked for SIE. Sony says this would include all of Majo’s managers since 2017, which were all women. Sony’s lawyer says that if those managers are included in the suit against Sony, “irreconcilable conflicts of interest” rise. \nOnly time will tell if the court approves Sony’s request to dismiss the case.  \n[Source: Axios]",

LTD., a long-time development partner that has worked on titles within franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario.\nIf you’ve been paying attention to the video game industry as of late, you likely already know that 2022 has so far been defined by one word: acquisitions. \nIt started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, a week later, Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion, and then two weeks later, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie, the developer behind Destiny 2, for $3.6 billion.\nNintendo revealed earlier this month that despite acquisitions happening throughout the industry, it wasn’t going to change its investment plans. It also revealed that it’s not against acquisitions they deem necessary and it seems acquiring SRD was the next necessary move for the Kyoto-based company. \nSRD was founded in 1979 and has worked closely with Nintendo for decades, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Not only has it worked with Nintendo on Mario and Zelda games, but the studio has helped develop Animal Crossing entries, Game Builder Garage, 1-2 Switch, and Ring Fit Adventure. This acquisition transaction is expected to be complete by April 1, 2022, and at the time of this writing, a price has not been named. \nNintendo said in a statement that acquiring SRD will “serve to strengthen the management base of SRD and secure the availability of software development resources for Nintendo,” according to Video Games Chronicle. \nToday’s news about this acquisition is the first following Nintendo’s purchase of Luigi’s Mansion 3 developer, Next Level Games, back in January of last year. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]",

          "description": "Developer:\n      Sony Interactive Entertainment\n      \nSince the previous PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles, game captures such as screenshots and videos have become more and more popular. With the start of this current generation back in 2020, it was clear that PlayStation and Xbox were going to encourage us even more to share our best captures. \nDoing so on Xbox Series X/S, and even Xbox One, has been relatively easy when it comes to getting images and videos off of the hard drive and onto your phone, for example. You simply capture what you want and in a few minutes, it’ll be automatically uploaded to the official Xbox app. From there, you can save and download the image to your phone, which makes sharing it on social media a breeze. However, that wasn’t possible on PlayStation, despite how much players wanted this feature…until now. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the video above, PlayStation has rolled this feature out for PS5 players. You’ll need to enable it in your console’s settings and the PlayStation App first, of course, but after that, screenshots and videos under three minutes long will be automatically uploaded to the PlayStation App. They’ll remain there for 14 days and during that time you can save and download any images or videos you want to your mobile device. And, much like with Xbox game captures, this makes it much easier to share your captures with friends and others on social media. \nFor more about the PS5, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 PlayStation 5 games and then check out these details about the latest PS5 beta, which adds extra party chat options, game base enhancements, UI changes, and more to the console.

Speaking specifically to the release of Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Square Enix acknowledges that it reviewed quite well – Game Informer gave it a 8.5 out of 10. However, it underperformed financially. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n“The HD Games sub-segment launched ‘Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy’ in Q3,” the results read. “Despite strong reviews, the game’s sales on launch undershot our initial expectations.”\nSquare Enix says that it has been using sales initiatives that it kicked off in November of 2021 to increase sales and the company intends to “work to continue to expand sales to make up for the title’s slow start.”\nHopefully, those sales can get Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy up to expectations, and even past it, because it certainly warrants a sequel that we’d like to see. For now, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy review and then check out these Adidas sneakers inspired by the game.
