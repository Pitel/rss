Theatrhythm Final Bar Line marks the return of the Final Fantasy rhythm series to Nintendo consoles after a 10-year break. We've had a chance to go hands-on with an upcoming demo for the game, which will be available on 1st February, and if the early goings-on is anything to go on, then this sequel is shaping up to be as much of a delight as the 3DS entries.\nIn the demo, we were able to try out two modes — Series Quests, which is open from the start, and Music Stages, which you unlock after beating your first song in Series Quests. Music Stages is pretty much the exact same as it was in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call: once you've unlocked the song, you can play it anytime you want on any difficulty you want. The demo allows you to unlock 30 songs, 30 characters, and level up your collection of cute characters to level 30 — and you can carry over your progress to the full game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Sales slide by 76%.\nThe latest UK charts are in and, as expected, the top ten is headlined by EA's recently released Dead Space remake. Meanwhile, Fire Emblem Engage, last week's star performer, has tumbled down to seventh place after a 76% drop in sales for the week. Not unexpected, necessarily, but we'd hoped to see it continue its exceptionally strong debut. Regardless, seventh is nothing to turn our noses at!\nMeanwhile, the only other new entry bar Dead Space is Square Enix's Forspoken, a game that has received decidedly mixed reception from critics and customers alike. The rest of the charts is made up of the usual suspects, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Pokémon Scarlet, so no surprises there.

German frozen pizza company Pizzatainment has today announced that it will be collaborating with Nintendo on a range of 'Mario-themed' pizzas — though the theme seems to be limited to the colour of the boxes (thanks, RTL Today).\nThere are two different pizzas currently announced for the collaboration: 'Triple-Salami-Explosion' and 'Quattro Formaggi Deluxe'. If you're thinking to yourself \"hmm, that doesn't sound like anything to do with Mario,\" then you would be correct. It isn't. What makes them 'Mario-themed' is the presence of Mario and co. on the boxes — hardly a prime advertisement for the franchise, but proof that Mario's face exists, we suppose.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Slog to the Nether Regions.\nYears in the making, Trek to Yomi is the vision of indie developer Leonard Menchiari, backed by Polish studio Flying Wild Hog and publisher Devolver Digital. Essentially a side-on slash 'em up, its hook is its spectacular aesthetic: feudal Japan and the samurai code recreated through cinematic camerawork in striking black and white. An homage to vintage Japanese films – most notably those of Akira Kurosawa – Trek to Yomi is a samurai story of revenge and redemption. It dives into the Shinto underworld of Yomi carrying some moral question marks to add a bit of intrigue.\nThe mood is set in an opening tutorial scene that sees protagonist Hiroki learning sword skills from his master. Suddenly, the master is called away on some serious business and Hiroki sets off in pursuit. What follows is a gorgeous, sweeping run of the camera through Hiroki’s village. Controlling in 3D, as you descend the towering steps from the dojo and follow the road directly down towards to bottom of the screen, the camera dollies backwards along the bustling main street of the village.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Across the Spongeverse.\nA few years ago, Purple Lamp Studios released SpongeBob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, a solid revival of a 3D platforming classic from decades past. Sales for that remaster were evidently robust enough to justify development of an all-new sequel, as SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake was announced a little over a year later. Built from the ground up for modern hardware, this new release carries on the spirit of the original while integrating many new ideas and designs of its own. Though The Cosmic Shake isn’t exactly a game that reinvents the 3D platforming wheel, it offers an enjoyable and delightful experience that no fan of this nostalgic genre will want to miss.\nThe Cosmic Shake picks up with SpongeBob and Patrick meeting a mysterious mermaid named Kassandra who offers them a bottle of mermaid tears for them to use as bubble soap. The tears have magical properties and legend has it that they have the ability to grant wishes, but things get out of hand when SpongeBob and Patrick overuse them and tear apart the multiverse. As a result of their mistake, Bikini Bottom has become drenched in cosmic jelly and overrun by strange jelly creatures, while all of SpongeBob and Patrick’s friends have been scattered across the various Wishworlds that opened portals all around town. The two thus set out to repair the damage and collect jelly for Kassandra, who totally doesn’t have ulterior motives.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Maybe it's the list of spin-offs I recently wrote up, which reminded me just how many excellent/terrible Pokémon spin-offs exist out there, or maybe it's the fact that when I was writing my answer to the question \"What Pokémon game should be the next basis for a Legends game?\" my thoughts went immediately to Mystery Dungeon, before realising that, actually, I just wanted another Mystery Dungeon game.\nEither way, that's the truth at the heart of the matter: I think Pokémon Mystery Dungeon needs to be pulled out of the Pokémon archive, dusted off, and given new life. We only have one PMD game on Switch, and it was just a remake of the first game, and it wasn't very good, so I can see why Nintendo might be unwilling to invest so much time and energy into commissioning a new one from developer Spike Chunsoft — but you have to admit that the pitch behind the games is brilliant, and deserves more than just a second look.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This was a theory which stated that it was possible to unlock the face textures for previous Bond actors Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton in the game's multiplayer mode after completing a series of near-impossible tasks.\nThis was, of course, not true (regardless of what Nintendo-working uncles might tell you); although the face textures of these past Bonds did exist in the game's ROM in some rudimentary form after initial plans to add the actors were scrapped thanks to some pesky legal worries.

The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.\r\n\n\r\n“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”\r\n\n\nThief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.\nTo be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable.

The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

          "description": "Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!\nBut did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.\nRead more",

I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: \"Wooooaaaah.\"\nConsider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.\nRead more",

You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. \r\n\n\r\nThese aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs. \nRead more",

          "description": "Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you're given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it's your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn't most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you're tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you'll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they're all swept away. \nIt's certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi's undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio's debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they're tipped in your favour.\nRead more",

          "description": "It’s only been a week since Microsoft announced they were laying off 10,000 human staff across their various divisions (including their games studios), but they've now revealed they’ll be investing billions of dollars into driving breakthroughs in AI. Microsoft will be pumping the money into futuristic tech firm OpenAI, which operates Turing-botherer chatbot ChatGPT and its artistic relative DALL-E. OpenAI’s already received two investments from Microsoft, one in 2019 and another in 2021. This third investment is intended to be “multi-year” and “multibillion dollar”, allowing both companies to “independently commercialize” whatever budding Skynets emerge.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I was actually pretty excited to review the game, and was hopeful that the dialogue would make sense and work in context. But unfortunately we, too, are one of the outlets who don't have code, so no PC review from us for a while.\nLike many others - and you too, if you've got a PS5 - I've been able to play the free Forspoken demo, which plops you into the game after the opening bumf, and presumably the cutscene where Frey establishes her modern girl \"lemme get this straight?!\" credentials.

          "description": "The highly-anticipated ATLA mobile RPG is finally here\nAvatar: The Last Airbender is widely considered to be one of the best animated series of all time, so it's not terribly surprising that it's getting another video game adaptation nearly twenty years after it premiered. Fans of the show are always clamoring for more content, so here's hoping that the new mobile action RPG Avatar Generations lives up to the hype. Created by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in collaboration with Navigation Games, the free-to-play title is now available on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.\nAs of now, the events of Avatar Generations will follow the adventures of Aang and company from the original series, but subsequent updates will touch on additional Avatar eras like The Rise of Kyoshi and The Legend of Korra. Players who start the game right now will get some welcome rewards, including Aang and Appa as characters to add to their squad. In classic RPG fashion, players will meet various characters from the show and be able to add them to their traveling party, including Katara, Sokka, Zuko, and Toph. Each character has their own set of abilities and special strengths as well, so you'll have some options in how you want to build your team.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV3wPu0sgfM\nAlong with the launch of the game, CDE also shared a new gameplay trailer, which shows off the game's turn-based combat and the adorable chibi art of the characters as they travel in the overworld across the Four Nations. While Avatar Generations is completely free to download, there will be some in-app purchases for \"exclusive items, cosmetics, and more.\" I guess it wouldn't be a free-to-play game without microtransactions, right?\nYou can check out the official Avatar Generations website for any future updates about the game, as well as some events on the horizon. As a fan of the Avatar series, I'm excited to give this one a shot!\nThe post Mobile RPG Avatar Generations launches with a new gameplay trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Tifa's bar, The Seventh Heaven; Cloud's motorcycle, The Hardy-Daytona' and the devastating \"Guard Scorpion\" robot will be among the items awaiting your jet-washing skills.\nhttps://twitter.com/sqex_ee/status/1620252315969265665?s=20&t=0shT7d5tDKcJW45Xt5YSZg\nUnfortunately, FuturLab did not offer up a trailer or release date for the new DLC, but obviously, the team wished to get the news out there on January 31, which is currently in the process of being officially designated \"Final Fantasy VII Day\". We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information on the Midgar Special Pack is available.

          "description": "Folks not finding $550 down the back of the sofa\nAccording to a new report from Bloomberg, Sony Interactive Entertainment has slashed its sales projections for its upcoming virtual reality hardware PlayStation VR2 (PSVR 2).\nBloomberg's sources claim that the studio has radically altered its sales estimations for the hugely expensive hardware — which launches worldwide on February 22, at a price of $550 USD. The report suggests that SIE has reduced expected sales from two million units to one million units. That's a 50% drop for all of you maths majors out there. The report claims that these altered sales projections are due to disappointing pre-order numbers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5L9Mvh7tAk&ab_channel=PlayStation\nThe reduced numbers also apply to the PSVR 2's production process, writes Bloomberg, suggesting that retailers and manufacturers have also been warned to adjust their expectations for units made and received. The pre-order process for PSVR 2 was initially invite-only, but the option to sign up for the princely hardware was soon made available to all customers. Sony itself has not commented on the claims, noting that it does not disclose product inventory.\nPlayStation 5 is undoubtedly an expensive piece of hardware, but is, obviously, an entire console platform. While the PSVR 2 technology is undoubtedly very impressive, it remains a niche audience item, and was never going to pull in the entirety, the majority, or even half of the PS5's user base. And at its expensive entry point — essentially a total rollout of $1000 for both the PS5 console and the PSVR 2 hardware — the likelihood of chart-topping sales in its launch year was always a lofty ambition.\nPlayStation VR2 launches worldwide on February 22, 2023.\nThe post Sony reportedly slashes PSVR 2 projections after disappointing pre-orders appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Carpenter weighs in on EA's latest release on Twitter\nServing as the director and composer for over a dozen horror classics, including Halloween, The Thing, and The Fog, John Carpenter has secured his role as one of the greatest horror filmmakers of all time. Fans of his films might not know that Carpenter is also something of a gamer, having expressed an interest in the Fallout, Horizon, and Borderlands series.\nWell, if you missed this detail in the past as I did, now we know that Carpenter is keeping up with the latest horror games, as he took to Twitter (with his aptly-chosen handle @TheHorrorMaster) yesterday to profess his love for EA's Dead Space remake -- more specifically, he called it a \"great game!\" exclamation point included. With so many games trying to imitate cinema, it's really cool to know a film legend who sees the legitimacy and artistic value in the interactive medium.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1619855538589937665\nIn an interview with AV Club last year, Carpenter also let in on the fact that he wants to make a Dead Space movie. \"I could do that,\" he said. Not only do I think you could do it, Mr. Carpenter, but I think you'd knock it out of the park. The cold confined indoor space of the Ishimura would be familiar territory for him, especially after helping to create The Thing's setting of an isolated Antarctic research site. I think we're due for another claustrophobic space horror flick, and this franchise would be a match made in heaven with Carpenter.\nWe're already in the middle of a flood of gaming adaptations, such as HBO's The Last of Us series, Amazon's upcoming Fallout series, and a Borderlands movie. Even amidst all these cool projects, I think John Carpenter's take on the Dead Space series would put them all to shame.\nThe post Horror icon John Carpenter calls the Dead Space remake a great game’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

The A.I. auto-battle function is also seeing an update, which should be great for all those times you don't want to issue commands yourself.\nA demonic strategy\nThe Disgaea series has always offered a signature blend of stylized, cartoon-y devils and immense replayability. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless certainly looks to have more of both. The improved auto-battle options especially seem like a boon, given how much of my experience with Disgaea was grinding to make the numbers go up.\nThis newest Disgaea is already out in Japan, having released on January 26.

          "description": "Supply has increased yet again\nSince the PlayStation 5 launched over two years ago, it's felt nearly impossible to get your hands on. Websites would sell out in minutes after a restock, and it quickly became something of a status symbol to flaunt on social media, because either you were lucky enough to get one during a drop, or you had enough disposable income to buy one off a scalper. The shortage occurred for a few different reasons, the foremost of which was the strain that the pandemic placed on global supply chains.\nAfter multiple promises that the console would be more readily available, it appears that the shortage has finally come to a close. In an official blog post, Sony Interactive's Vice President of Brand, Hardware, and Peripherals Isabella Tomatis thanked fans for their \"patience as [Sony] navigated unprecedented demand for the PS5 console amid global challenges.\" She then said that anyone who was still looking to get their hands on a PS5 should have a \"much easier time finding one at retailers globally.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_360393\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nEven after promises that they'd ramp up production by the end of last year for the holidays, Sony still had a tough time keeping the console on shelves in 2022. Of course, they gave us similar assurances even before that. I was fine without a PS5 to call my own for the past few years, but now that there are some next-gen games on the horizon that I'm actually pumped for, I'm wanting to get on the bandwagon relatively soon. The ever-popular digital-only version of the PS5 (which is also $100 cheaper than the model that can take disks) is still sold out as of my writing this, but at least there are some options available for purchase right now for players who have patiently waited years for their console.\nThe post Sony says that PS5 consoles will be ‘much easier’ to get this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

This image gives off some of the familiar hometown-story vibes that Life is Strange has been known for. But we probably won't know much more about it until Don't Nod Montreal is ready to fully reveal it.\nThe post Don’t Nod Montreal is teasing a nostalgic new project appeared first on Destructoid.",

You have until April 26 to redeem the offer: so if you still play Fallout 76, you may as well head here, click \"OK\" and come back to it eventually.\nCan you believe that it's been over four years since this game launched? It's hard to come to terms with the fact that this didn't fizzle out entirely shortly after launch, but at the very least, the Fallout name is still kicking while Bethesda plans their next move.

Movie, an adaptation of one of gaming's most beloved and successful franchises of all time — Notably, the clip features up our first opportunity to hear Seth Rogan's performance of the mighty Donkey Kong, one of many familiar faces that will be showing up in the colorful adventure.\nThe clip rolls out with footage we've seen before, as our boy Mario finds himself on the receiving end of a beatdown from the banana-lovin' ape. Looking to the skies to save him, Mario hits a Question Block and bags himself a Cat Suit, as featured in Wii U release Super Mario 3D World. Unfortunately, Mario's solemn \"Meow\" fails to impress Kong, who promptly mocks him before continuing the ass-kicking.\nhttps://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1619795800686739456?s=20&t=fwHS1JERA9tBi1kQ8j3riw\nI'd love to think that the \"Meow\" line is a sly dig at the notorious first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's probably just a coincidence. Anyway, you can check out Seth Rogan's snippet of dialogue in the tweet embedded above, and you can watch the original trailer in our previous report. Seth Rogan will be joined by and ensemble cast that includes Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), and Charlie Day (Luigi)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7.

The story concerns a charming, dot-eyed kiwi known as Tiki, who is the sole escapee from a flock of his brethren, abducted by a huge, nefarious walrus. Seriously outnumbered and outweighed, Tiki donss his best pair of kicks, grabs his trusty bow-and-arrow, and ventures forth across a highly-stylized \"NewZealand\", determined to rescue his party of pals and the love of his life, Phee-Phee.\nYou can check out the adorable action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Shadowserg.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdyRIX4q0MY&ab_channel=Shadowserg\nWhat follows is some delightfully cartoonish platform action, as Tiki navigates four distinct zones, each containing four stages. At the end of each zone, a huge level guardian awaits, who Tiki must defeat to save a pal and journey into the next sector. It's a wonderful example of the genre, recognized for its fun visuals, infectious music, and cute characters. As playable today as it ever was.\nThe NewZealand Story would be a smash hit in both the arcade and the home markets, selling an amazing amount of copies on platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga. Such is the legacy of Taito's '80s hit, our loveable hero Tiki, despite only cameoing in a few titles since, is stillone of gaming's most instantly recognizable characters, even to those yet to experience his iconic adventure.\nThe NewZealand Story is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Taito’s beloved The NewZealand Story joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

I missed out on the golden age of the James Bond title because I wasn't even a year old when it came out, but hearing friends and colleagues recounting the magical months and years that followed its release, I'm somewhat envious of a time before online gamer rage.

          "description": "Sony has slashed its shipment forecasts for the upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset it is launching next month, according to a new report from Bloomberg. \nThe publication reports that Sony has halved its forecast from 2 million units shipped this quarter to 1 million as a result of disappointing pre-order numbers ahead of the February 22 launch date. Bloomberg reports that Sony has told a supply partner to prepare for a reduction in display panel orders, and PlayStation is expecting to ship roughly 1.5 million units between this April and March 2024. That expectation could change if steam picks up around PSVR2, though. \nAs for the disappointing pre-order numbers, it's not surprising – would-be PSVR2 adopters have been vocal about the price point of the headset. The standard retail package of PSVR2 will cost players $549.99, which is more expensive than the PlayStation 5 console required to play PSVR2. If you don't own a PS5 yet but want to jump into the PSVR2 ecosystem, you're essentially looking at spending over $1000. \nPlus, some players have been outspoken about their disappointment in the PSVR2 launch lineup as well, which includes many games already available on other VR platforms or games previously playable on PlayStation VR's first iteration. The launch window lineup includes more than 30 games, including a big first-party release in Horizon: Call of the Mountain, but it also recently saw Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR, one of the more anticipated PSVR2 titles, get delayed out of this window. \nPSVR2 launches on February 22. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nAre you picking up PSVR2 next month?

Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. \n\n\nDisgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. \nUnlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one.

          "description": "Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong. \nReleased during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. \nFor more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach. \nWhat do you think of this new clip?

Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version. I played a decent chunk of both versions to see which one I prefer to play in 2023.\nWhen GoldenEye 007 launched in the late 1990s, I played it obsessively both solo and with friends for months upon months.

Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. \nCheck out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: \nThe journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d\nJanuary 27, 2023\nAs for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. \nEpisode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \nWhat do you think Season 2 of The Last of Us will cover?

In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.\nThe bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.\n\n\nWe also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. \nRedfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.",

A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. \nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nHi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass.

          "description": "During today's Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang's latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. \nIn the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.\nA blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.",

And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, \"Infected,\" has broken another HBO record.\n\"Infected\" brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week's 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network's history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the \"largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,\" which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. \nWeirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. \nEpisode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Variety]\nDid you like Episode 2 more than Episode 1?

          "description": "Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. \nMicrosoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company's ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there's no official indication that Halo Infinite's course is changing following these layoffs. \nStill, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: \npic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59\nJanuary 21, 2023\nIt's a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Halo Infinite review. \nDo you think 343 Industries should continue to develop Halo games?

          "description": "Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. \nThis news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it's been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it's clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. \nNo HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!\nJanuary 22, 2023\nInfinity Ward's tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if \"no HUD\" is any indication, it'll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. \nWhile waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.\nWhich Season 2 update are you most excited about?

That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.
