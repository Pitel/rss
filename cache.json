Granted, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a little lower than our estimates when it debuted in 14th place last week, but when we scrolled through this week's list and found it had disappeared entirely, well, we frankly couldn't believe it.\nAlas, it's true. The exceptional RPG remake from Square Enix has crashed out of the top 40 altogether, marking a stark difference between audiences' tastes in the UK when compared to Japan. We knew it would never do gangbusters, of course – Dragon Quest never really does well in the UK – but goodness, this is absurd. At least its performance over in Japan will likely be enough to keep Squeenix satisfied for now.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We still don't have a precise release date for the catchily-titled (deep breath) Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist & the White Guardian, but we do know that it'll be launching at some point in 2025. Other details are slim, but Koei Tecmo has shed a little more light on the upcoming project in a recent tweet.\nLet's get the biggie out of the way first: Atelier Resleriana will not include a gacha system. The game's mobile predecessor, Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator, was guilty of relying perhaps a little too heavily on pull rates and paid-only options, so it's nice to hear that we'll see no such systems in the console spin-off.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And by gum, if you’ve been a fan of Nintendo for a while now, then you’ll know that My Nintendo’s predecessor, Club Nintendo, was often great. In operation from 2002 (region-depending) until 2015, Club Nintendo offered up some of the most incredible, one-of-a-kind products imaginable. A golden Twilight Princess statue, a SNES controller for the Wii, a Year of Luigi coin, multiple CD soundtracks... It really felt like the sky was the limit for Club Nintendo, and we’re saddened that My Nintendo will likely never match its brilliance.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

April Fools’ Day 2024 saw plenty of enticing fake announcements, but there was one smaller prank nestled among the big hitters that stung just a little bit extra. Developer Inti Creates, known for games like Blaster Master Zero and Azure Striker Gunvolt, took to social media that fateful day to unveil Divine Dynamo Flamefrit: an all-new, top-down, action-adventure, dungeon-crawler game.\nSuffice it to say, it left quite the strong impression with its stylish 16-bit graphics, its flashy combat, and, most importantly, its utter devotion to replicating the cheesy aesthetic of '80s and '90s-era shonen anime. While the trailer was clearly marked as an April Fools’ Day joke, that didn’t stop fans from letting Inti Creates know that this was a game they wanted to actually play. Fortunately, the developer made it happen. Once just an intricately crafted joke, Divine Dynamo Flamefrit is now out in a fully playable form — and it’s quite the enjoyable little romp.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

These three are your guides as you try to piece together the mysterious and sudden murder of a rich matriarch on a train through a series of goofy, absurd item combinations, interspersed with plot twists, reveals, and comedic cutscenes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder.

Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. \nJorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.\n  \nRead more",

The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a \"solar-powered\" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.\n Read more",

All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.\nBecause your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.\nRead more",

The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn't known, as Reflector haven't made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative. \nRead more",

I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: \"ah, that was good.\"\nSo what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot.

          "description": "I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

Let's first round up some good links with writing and videos about videogames.\r\n\nThis is surely the best link this week: an hour-long video on how to beat \"every possible game of Pokemon Platinum at the same time\". That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously. It's an impressive feat, but the video itself is great too, patiently breaking down the process with motion graphics and video editing flair. Delightful.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.\nBut when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.\nRead more",

Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been \"you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?\", because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.\nRead more",

In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as \"co-developers\" on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!\nOriginal article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.\nRead more",

          "description": "My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.\nRead more",

That way, you can gauge whether you should reroll. That said, Discord is also a great source of information on the game, but from a more social side. You can ask other experienced players there for tips or how certain mechanics work. It’s a great place to check with others what strategies work and what to avoid.\n\n\nThe Blue Lock Rivals Discord is also where you can track news, updates, and announcements for the game. I like checking back often for patch notes to see what was nerfed, buffed, or added. Also, you can find more codes here for free goodies in addition to any giveaways.

          "description": "The Bazaar's closed beta is already receiving praise from the gaming community, and it could be an exciting addition to the world of digital card games.\n\n\nThat said, the closed beta has its share of issues that can prevent you from enjoying the gameplay. It's one of those titles that require a persistent internet connection, and there have been instances where players have been unable to connect to the server. Let's take a look at how you might be able to fix the situation if such troubles occur.\n\n\nHow to fix the \"Unable to connect to the server\" error in The Bazaar\n\n\nIf you see this message pop up, it means that the client is being unable to connect to the server. Till the situation is fixed, you won't be able to enjoy any bit of the gameplay. Here are a few steps you can take to solve the problem from your end potentially. But first, make sure to check the server status.\n\n\nYou can do so by following the game's X handle or by joining the official Discord. If the servers are down for some reason, chances are that you can find the relevant information here. While the servers are down, there's not much that you can do apart from bidding your time.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I get the error (which appears to be random), I usually restart the game. I am unsure why restarting your client fixes the issue, but it appears to be the best solution. Of course, this should be done only when you're sure that the servers are operational. Doing this while there's maintenance going on isn't going to fix anything at all.\n\n\nThat said, The Bazaar's servers are reasonably stable, and there aren't too many bugs that will spoil your experience. However, it's still a beta, so expect to encounter bugs and glitches occasionally. The game can be bought directly from the game's website, and becoming an early founder will have certain advantages in the long run.\n\nThe post How to fix poor connection issues in The Bazaar appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stalker 2 has its fair share of unique weapons that you can unlock, and the Trophy rifle is certainly one that can easily remain hidden throughout your entire save.\n\n\nTypically, you can unlock extra weapons if you've purchased the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition. These weapons can be found in different Journalist Stashes, and you'll get them gradually. That said, the Trophy gun is available even if you've purchased the Standard Edition. \n\n\nAs I said, finding it can be a bit tricky, and there are high chances that you might have gone past the place without knowing that there's a secret gun for you to discover.\n\n\nHow to get the Trophy gun in Stalker 2\n\n\nTo find this weapon, you'll have to play a bit to unlock the Chemical Plant region. This place has plenty of POIs, including the Army Warehouses, which itself has some great resources. If you've purchased the Ultimate Edition of the game, you can also find the Lullaby assault rifle from this spot. To get the Trophy gun, you'll have to travel west from where the Army Warehouses location. To simplify matters, I have marked the location on the screenshot below.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you reach the spot, you'll notice a broken structure. I am not sure what exactly it is (it looks like a broken incubator), and you'll find a corpse lying in front of it. If you look carefully on the map, you'll find two other structures located close to this spot. All three structures are actually connected, and all you have to do is throw a grenade through the opening of the structure (the one with the corpse).\n\n\n\n\nJust wait, and there will be three explosions. The third explosion will open a structure similar to the one where you threw the grenade. Once cracked open, you'll find a stash waiting for you to be unlocked. This stash contains the Trophy gun (an assault rifle, rather) and a bunch of useful items like ammo, consumables, and grenades.\n\nThe post How to find Trophy gun in Stalker 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There’s an issue with Valorant when it comes to Windows 11 that may require you to enable Secure Boot on your end.\n\n\nPlaying Valorant on PC can have all sorts of issues ranging from anti-cheat, updates, and other technical problems. If you’re getting issues after installing Windows 11 or you’re on fresh hardware, you may need to try this.\n\n\nHow to check for Secure Boot on Valorant on PC\n\n\nTo see if you’re able to enable Secure Boot, you must first check if your computer supports it or if it has been turned on. Follow the instructions below:\n\n\n\nPress the Windows Key and X at the same time. \n\nYou can also press the Windows button at the bottom of your screen.\n\n\n\n\nType “msinfo32” without the quotes and hit enter. \n\n\nThe System Information menu will come up.\n\n\nUnder the System Summary tab, look for BIOS Mode and Secure Boot State.\n\n\nBIOS Mode should be set to UEFI and Secure Boot State should be set to On.\n\n\n\nWhat is more important is the Secure Boot State option. If it isn’t on, or you can’t set this option on, you may need to upgrade or downgrade your OS (Operating System). If on Windows 10, try going to 11. If on 11, go back to 10. \n\n\nIt’s a hassle, but this is one of the more consistent workarounds to get the Secure Boot State working.\n\n\nImage via Riot Games\n\n\nHow to enable Secure Boot on PC for Valorant\n\n\nTo enable Secure Boot, turn off or reset your PC. If you turned off your PC, boot it up again and then follow these instructions: \n\n\n\nWhen restarting or turning your computer on, press the corresponding key that will bring up the BIOS.\n\n\nMore often than not, it’ll either be F2 or F11. \n\n\nIn the BIOS settings, look for Secure Boot and set it on. \n\n\n\nIf your keys, layout, or process are different, it’ll depend on your motherboard manufacturer. That will require an additional search to look up the menu layout and navigation for your specific part.\n\nThe post How to enable Secure Boot in Valorant appeared first on Destructoid.",

The earworm of a soundtrack is getting the spotlight in Shovel Knight: Steel Thy Concert, a live event coming to Los Angeles and New York City in January and February 2025.\n\n\nThe announcement was made along with the latest update to the Mina the Hollower Kickstarter. That's fitting since, in addition to a bunch of beloved Shovel Knight tracks, the concert will feature an unreleased track from Yacht Club's upcoming Zelda-inspired game. \n\n\nThe concert will run for two hours, featuring jams from the main Shovel of Hope campaign, as well as DLC additions Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment, and King of Cards. Gameplay footage will serve as the backdrop while the live orchestral and rock ensemble takes over the stage. \n\n\nHere's the trailer and location info:\n\n\n\n\nShovel Knight: Steel Thy Concert Show Dates\n\n\n\nLos Angeles, The Fonda Theatre, January 19th, 2025\n\n\nNew York City, The Town Hall, February 22nd, 2025 \n\n\n\nThere will also be a live chat with special guests from Yacht Club, as well as exclusive merch like shirts, keychains, and posters. Those who opt for a VIP pass will get to attend a meet-and-greet and poster signing with composer Jake Kaufman, designer Sean Velasco, programmer David D'Angelo, and artist Nick Wozniak. \n\n\nTickets are on sale now, and there's currently a 20 percent discount until December 3. Purchases made during the sale period will also come with a free Steam key for Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon. \n\n\nIf this has you both reflecting on the past and looking toward the future of Yacht Club Games, it sounds like Mina the Hollower is doing well. According to the latest update, the team is close to having a stitch ready so the game can be playable all the way through for the first time. We'll have to wait until 2025 for more on that, though. \n\nThe post Shovel Knight concert celebrates 10 years of shovelin’ in January appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After many years of hopeful speculation, CD Projekt Red just finally announced that the studio is, indeed, putting all of its efforts into bringing The Witcher's next mainline game into fruition.\n\n\nMichał Nowakowski, CD Projekt's joint CEO, just took to the studio's website to inform that the development of \"Project Polaris\", the codename for the new Witcher project, has been ongoing for several weeks now.\n\n\n\"I’m proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication\"\n\n\nMore interestingly, \"Polaris\" refers not just to the tentative The Witcher 4, but to its sequels as well, since \"Polaris\" stands for a whole trilogy, not a standalone game.\n\n\nNowakowski also talked about the recent success of Cyberpunk 2007 and Phantom Liberty.\n\n\n\"In less than four years since release we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips\"\n\n\nIt took them a good while, but it seems as though CD Projekt has finally been able to break the curse and turn Cyberpunk 2077 around. Here's hoping the studio has learned its lesson(s) and takes the necessary time to make sure the next chapter in the Witcher series comes out in great shape.\n\n\nThe Witcher 4 still doesn't have a release date, which is to be expected. However, we'll be watching closely and hoping that some day soon, we'll know when to expect this next entry in this beloved series. \n\nThe post The Witcher 3’s sequel is now in full production appeared first on Destructoid.",

If so, you might be tacking on some more waiting, since tomorrow will mark the return of Devolver Delayed, the stream in which the publisher announced which games aren’t going to hit their planned release date.\n\n\n‘Tis the season, by which I mean, it’s nearing the end of 2024. Games marked “Coming in 2024” are running out of year to push things out the door. Everyone is firing up their PR machine to update their schedules, and, as usual, Devolver has the most ostentatious way of doing it with a stream dedicated to pushing things back. Kicking them down the field. So on.\n\n\nWhat games are on the docket? I don’t know! According to Steam, Devolver has three games that are still slated for 2024: Stick It to the Stickman, Skate Story, and Baby Steps. Could be any of them. Could be all of them. Two of them are defending their titles from last year. Maybe they’ll get creative and delay a game that hasn’t even been announced. Perhaps they could push back a game they already released. They could delay a game that they aren’t even publishing. Such power!\n\n\nIf it’s anything like last year’s stream, it will be short. Devolver Delayed 2023 was three minutes. Would you rather that your hope sprung eternal? Well, then, they’ve also coyly added, “And who knows, we might even show you something new.” They might! It’s a possibility!\n\n\nDevolver Delayed 2024 is airing on November 27, 2024 at 10 am PT (1 pm ET).

In a 24-hour marathon, the group opened more than 1,500 booster packs and contributed to the longest unboxing live stream video ever. \n\n\nThe Pokémon Company explained that hundreds of products were unboxed, and over 20,000 cards were shown off during the live stream. The content creators also sported Pokémon Center and other products from the franchise over the course of the event. After the 24-hour mark was reached, the adorable Pikachu showed up and helped the streamers accept the Guinness World Records certificate.\n\n\nImage via The Pokémon Company\n\n\nA cool gesture, after this Pokémon Company world record was achieved, is that these thousands of cards have been donated to charities ahead of the holidays, including Bernardo's, a UK organization which helps children and families living in poverty. They have been \"carefully curated into binders to create incredible collections of Trading Card Game cards,\" said the press release.\n \nThe expansion Scarlet & Violet - Surging Sparks - just launched earlier this month, and this event was a way to help promote it. It includes the Stellar Tera Pokémon ex, which includes a cool Pikachu with the powerful Topaz Bolt attack. Some cards are themed around the Terarium, a location from The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. One of the cards includes the Aloolan Exeggutor as a Stellar Tera Pokémon ex as well.\n\n\nYou can get the cards physically or digitally through the TCG Live app. The press release says you'll be able to receive in-game bonuses while logging into it.\n\nThe post The Pokémon Company breaks world record with European content creators, 20,000+ cards unboxed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A team of hackers from Brazil have taken first place in a hackathon organized by the country's telecoms regulator. The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, \"there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use,\" the hacker predicted.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly.

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

          "description": "Čekal jsem od Hugha Granta v roli chlípného starce hodně, a i přesto jsem byl příjemně překvapen. Je skvělý. Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)",

          "description": "Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.\n\n\nExistuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně \"zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!\" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A \"nevíme jak\" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…",
