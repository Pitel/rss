          "description": "Bloody. Good. Game.\nWe'd be lying like filthy, filthy little devils if we claimed that there was any shortage of Castlevania-alikes on the Switch. The likes of Odallus, Aggelos and most prominently the Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon duology are all right there on the eShop to cater for starved fans of Konami's apparently-defunct series - not to mention the Castlevania Anniversary Collection and Castlevania Advance Collection for those thirsting to revisit. It was with some familiarity, then, that we dove headlong into Infernax for review. It all looked very much familiar, you see — medieval style world, NES throwback visuals and a Metroidvania map. But we were, gratefully, mistaken. See, this isn't really a Castlevania-like at all, it's closer to Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden in both difficulty and game feel. And that's certainly no bad thing.\nComing from Berzerk Studio (developer of the sublime Just Shapes & Beats), Infernax is an interesting halfway house between accessibility and raw challenge. Putting it that way makes it sound like the game is uneven in its difficulty, but that isn't the case. It's more that you have options. If you're struggling to make progress, you're never too far from a save point and you can always go elsewhere and fight monsters for XP and/or money, which is then spent on health potions, extra lives, upgrades to your weapon and armour, spells and even more besides. You can also take up sidequests that reward you with more gold and experience, the latter of which is used to upgrade your core strength, health and mana. You're always just within spitting distance of your next improvement, too, which kept us playing when frustration could have set in from its challenges.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "With a rather expensive accessory, of course.\nBack in 2004, the idea of making a video call with your mobile phone felt like the future. 3G was just taking off and several phones were sold on this feature alone – even though the image quality was often terrible and it was impossible to get a signal strong enough to use it often. Although it wouldn't be until much later than 'Face Time' calls became the norm, one company tried to make video calling on the GBA a reality in 2004 – with mixed results.\nJapanese firm Digital Act released the Campho Advance in 2004, a bolt-on camera that allowed you to make video calls using your Nintendo handheld. With a 1.1 megapixel camera and 5fps performance, it wasn't exactly a smooth experience – and that's before you factor in that you have to be connected to a power supply and telephone while using it. Hardly what you'd call elegant. And the price? 19,000 yen was, back in 2004, the equivalent of around £164 / $222, so it wasn't cheap, either.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Don't hold your breath waiting for a new generation system.\nThe frenzy and excitement around this week's Nintendo Direct is settling down, and it seems that the general consensus among the majority is that it was pretty darn good. Through first- and third-party reveals, Nintendo has set out a release schedule up to September that is busy, to put it mildly. It's also a line-up that suits a broad audience, as it should for Switch, with everything from deep RPG experiences to family fun, platforming and more.\nIt was a broadcast and line-up interesting for other reasons too, notably tone. It was the first time in what feels like years that Nintendo brought a bit of full-on goofiness back with a demonstration of Nintendo Switch Sports. There was a Wii-era vibe to some announcements too, such as the return of franchises like 'Sports' (we suppose that's the brand!) and Mario Strikers. It's a good time for this stuff, too, as the Switch is now well into the second half of its life and is ripe for both serving up nostalgia and introducing its huge userbase to some lapsed brands.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.\nIn the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.\nRead more",

It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.\nPerhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.\nRead more",

Some feared this hole might be present in Elden Ring too. Bamco now say that Elden Ring is fine, but those Dark Souls servers won't come back down until after FromSoftware's new game launches.\nRead more",

It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. \nFor example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.\nRead more",

After everything they told me. I will show them that even I can be the best player.”\nThe pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.\nRead more",

I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)\nReader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.\nRead more",

I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.\nThat's right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad.

I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!\nIt reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.\nRead more",

He's one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio's classic RPG Nox? That's Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.\nA streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of \"best of\" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.\nRead more",

For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath.

I'm struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it's had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I'm hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.\nRead more",

And you’ll need it too if you want to survive battles through magma-infused Muspels and the icy realm of Jotnar while Odin seeks to defeat the fire giant Surtr and save Baldr. \nYou’ll learn about all that and more in Ubisoft’s latest Dawn of Ragnarok overview trailer, which you can watch below: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer above, it goes over basically everything you can expect in this expansion – powers, equipment and gear, the story, trials and challenges, puzzles, how it affects Eivor, and more. \nIf you’re looking for even more information about the game, be sure to read Game Informer’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok preview and then check out our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla review.

Nostalgia for games like that helps them a lot in many cases, but that only gets you so far – at the end of the day, you do actually need to create a great game when attempting to dig back into the treasure chest that is 8-bit and 16-bit action-adventure gameplay. I'm happy to report that Berzerk Studio's Infernax, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on February 14, has been a blast so far. \nWhile I've not completed the game just yet, there's plenty within that I want to keep a secret for yourself to view in the full game. However, if you've not heard of Infernax or are looking for more information about it, we have you covered with the first 15 minutes of the game (and if you're anything like me, these first 15 minutes will sell you on the game quite well). \nIn this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc, Ben Reeves, and Marcus Stewart talk and walk you through the first 15 minutes of Infernax. Is it hitting the highs of the games it's inspired by? Find out in this special preview video. Thanks for watching and be sure to let us know what you think of Infernax.",

          "description": "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has expectedly led to back-and-forth discourse about the likelihood of exclusivity. In response, Head of Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed that popular titles like Call of Duty would remain multiplatform. However, at the end of that same statement, Spencer briefly voiced Microsoft's interest \"in taking similar steps to support Nintendo's successful platform.\" While this leaves room for interpretation, a recent CNBC interview doubles down on Spencer's final remarks meaning Microsoft might bring Call of Duty to Switch. \nIt is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on \"violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws,\" specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.\n\nAccording to a Eurogamer report, Microsoft's President Brad Smith told CNBC, \"We'd like to bring [Call of Duty] to Nintendo devices. We'd like to bring the other popular titles that Activision Blizzard has, and ensure that they continue to be available on PlayStation, [and] that they become available on Nintendo.\" Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that future or current Call of Duty games will be developed with the Switch in mind. Still, Spencer and Smith's words might indicate a future where Call of Duty is readily available on every platform. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nWould you dive right in if Call of Duty was ported to Switch?

So, it’s no surprise that fans are still taking to the high-speed tracks of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe almost five years after its initial launch.

Wave 1 includes an exciting mixture of classic and recent maps like Paris Promenade, Toad Circuit, Choco Mountain, Coconut Mall, Tokyo Blur, Shroom Ridge, Sky Garden, and Ninja Hideaway. If you already have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion membership, you’ll get instant access to the Booster Course Pass when the first wave is available in a few months. You can also pre-order it for $25.\nWe loved Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as much as its dedicated fandom. Brian Shea concluded his review by saying: \n“Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is primarily a re-release of an acclaimed game from three years ago, but by adding new content and addressing the biggest complaint of the original, this version is unquestionably the best way to experience Nintendo's great racer. Battle mode is back to its original glory, and when combined with the rest of the robust Mario Kart 8 package, it creates a great addition to the fledgling Switch library.”\n\n\nWhat tracks are you hoping to see throughout the year?

That compilation disc included five rudimentary sports titles and showed players the capabilities of the Wii's then-groundbreaking motion controls. It was an immediate smash hit, attracting demographics that extended far beyond Nintendo's typical gaming audience. However, while the Nintendo Switch has now outsold the wildly popular Wii and it has its fair share of wide-reaching smash hits like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the console/handheld hybrid hasn't had another transcendent game experience like the original Wii Sports. Now, with the aptly named Nintendo Switch Sports, fans of Wii Sports can relive past glories.\nNintendo Switch Sports gathers six sports and lets you control them using the motion controls of the Switch Joy-Cons. Tennis, bowling, and chambara (swordplay) all return to the Sports series, while this iteration adds soccer, volleyball, and badminton. If you buy the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports, you also receive a Leg Strap accessory that allows your Joy-Con to track your leg, which can be used in soccer's Shootout Mode.\nYou can play in-person with family and friends like the original Wii Sports or play online in ranked matchmaking or against friends on your Nintendo Switch Online list. Two free updates were also announced for Nintendo Switch Sports. The first one, coming this summer, adds the ability to use the Leg Strap peripheral for the main game of soccer. This fall, another free update will add golf to the collection of sports you can play.\nNintendo Switch Sports arrives on Switch on April 29. If you'd like to check it out before then, Nintendo is hosting a special online play test from February 18 to 20, where Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can play bowling, chambara, and tennis.",

Nintendo announced the SNES classic Earthbound is finally making its way to Switch, and its NES prequel dubbed Earthbound Beginnings will be joining it.\nEarthbound will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online SNES collection, being added to the service for no additional cost. Likewise, Earthbound Beginnings will become a new part of the Switch's NES collection. \nFor those unfamiliar with Earthbound, it's a 1994 JRPG that follows a small-town boy named Ness who is tasked by a time-traveling bee to save the world from an alien invasion. Along his travels across the globe, he meets plenty of strange characters and forms a party with three other very capable children. In Japan, it's known as Mother 2, although it's the first of the series that made its way stateside.\nEarthbound Beginnings is the original Mother title that didn't see release outside of Japan for 16 years. The 1989 JRPG was localized and released on Wii U in 2015. Like Earthbound, you play as a seemingly normal kid named Ninten with psychic powers who goes on a strange adventure. This is the second time Earthbound Beginnings has been made available, skipping release on 3DS and the NES Classic.\nHopefully, the release of these absolute classics will open the door for Mother 3 to see the light of day outside of Japan in some way.

Now, I know we've already had a chance to check out the Final Fantasy Tactics-style combat and social engineering political strategy in an earlier demo, but this new demo? Players can experience the game all the way until the end of chapter 3 during this demo. Probably even more relevant, progress from this demo is going to carry over into the full release!\nSo if you want to try out some classes and see how they perform in battle or flit around with different story strategies as to what nation you're trying to help or hinder, this is the time. Or you could just try to get a super overpowered class composition and be ready for launch. You do you, ya know? Oh, and for those that haven't played, this is a good chance to see what the game is all about!",

In today's trailer shown during the latest Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at some of Kirby's abilities in the game. \nAs you'd expect, they involve him sucking items up and transforming based on what he swallowed. This ability is known as Kirby's Mouthful Mode, and when he sucks up something like a car, for example, Car Mouth is activated. In Car Mode, Kirby can race around the level, ramming through any enemies in his way. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nThe trailer revealed many other mouth forms like Vending Mouth, which sees Kirby suck up a vending machine that allows him to shoot juice cans at enemies, Cone Mouth, which lets him spike down on something after sucking up a cone, and more. There's also Scissor-lift Mouth, Ring Mouth, Light-Bulb Mouth, Arch Mouth, and even Water-Balloon Mouth. \nThat's not everything shown in the trailer, though. We got a look at Waddle Dee Town, which is where Waddle Dee lives and home to Waddle Dee's Weapon Shop. Here, you can purchase items and evolutions like the Cutter and Chakram Cutter, Volcano Fire, Clutter Needle, Gigant Sword, Noble Ranger, Frosty Ice, and Toy Hammer. You'll need all of these and more to successfully make your way through Kirby's latest adventure in Kirby and the Forgotten Land. \nFortunately, you don't have to wait much longer to play this game because it hits Switch on March 25. While waiting for that, read about why Kirby and the Forgotten Land might be the cutest post-apocalypse ever, and then watch this trailer released last month that showcases Kirby's copy abilities and the game's co-op mode.

It's back in Three Hopes, which will bring Byleth, Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, and all of your favorite students and teachers from Three Houses back for the fight.

          "description": "When Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard, one of the first questions was whether Call of Duty and the publisher's other existing titles would eventually become Xbox exclusives. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer quickly stated that Microsoft plans to honor existing contractual agreements between Sony and Activision regarding Call of Duty specifically and vaguely expressed a desire to keep the series on PlayStation. \nThough pretty definitive, the second bit of Phil's statement left room for interpretation. A new blog post by Microsoft further clarifies its commitment to keeping Activision Blizzard titles multiplatform. The post, which discusses a new set of Microsoft Store principles in preparation for the Activision acquisition approval process, says the following:\nIn short, Microsoft will continue to allow future Call of Duty entries and other titles to remain multiplatform even after they're not legally required to. You can still interpret this message to refer to existing franchises with established fanbases. New IPs could be a different story. But for now, those who want to continue playing Overwatch, Diablo, or Crash Bandicoot on multiple consoles seemingly have nothing to worry about in the long term. \nAs a reminder, assuming Microsoft's acquisition passes the lengthy government approval process, the deal isn't expected to close until around the summer of 2023. Activision Blizzard continues to operate as an independent entity until that time. If/when that happens, it's good to know that whatever dead Activision franchises Microsoft chooses to resurrect have a strong chance of appearing on non-Xbox platforms.",

It became wildly popular overseas and now Octopath fans in the west will have their chance to see why when the English version arrives this year.\nChampions of the Continent plays similarly to the original title. The turn-based field command system remains but up to eight characters can take the battlefield instead of only four. Naturally, the game retains the original’s signature HD-2D art style. \nStory-wise, the game still takes place on the continent of Osterra. The narrative has three paths starring Herminia the \"Witch of Greed\", Tytos the \"Hero\", and Auguste the \"Playwright\". Each character is on a journey to find wealth, power, and glory, respectively, and whoever you choose acts as a Chosen One fighting against a great evil. Fans of the first Octopath Traveler can expect to bump into familiar faces from that game as well. \nOCTOPATH TRAVELER: Champions of the Continent (English ver.) will launch in North America and Europe in 2022!\n#octopathcotc #オクトラ大陸の覇者https://t.co/S0OlifhWz6 pic.twitter.com/2wPwNMJbhT\nFebruary 8, 2022\nOctopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a free-to-play title with microtransactions; new characters are obtained using standard gacha-style mechanics. The game launches on iOS and Android in North America and Europe sometime in 2022 with a closed beta beginning in Spring. New information is expected to drop in “mid-February” on the game’s newly launched Facebook page. \nUntil then, Octopath’s spiritual tactical follow-up Triangle Strategy is on the horizon, releasing on March 4.",
