That's not even the end of it, either, but for the full rundown on how to get everything prepped for Konga Beat, creator Parham Gholami has provided a full breakdown of what you'll need to do (it's also worth noting that this is only for Windows-based PCs at the moment).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Apart from the director Jeff Fowler teasing some new details, it seems we might also now have the runtime of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\nAccording to a listing by AMC Theatres (via Sonic Stadium), Sonic 3 will have a runtime of 1 hour and 49 minutes, when it launches on 20th December 2024. For anyone wondering, that's apparently 13 minutes shorter than the second movie which surpassed the two-hour mark (2 hours and 2 minutes). The first movie was 1 hour and 39 minutes and was the shortest of the lot.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A long-delayed, quickly discontinued, infamous flop, the 64's bulky expansion was supposed to provide the console with an additional 'middle-ground' between cartridge and CD. Instead, it ended up being a black mark on an otherwise pretty spotless record (hey, we said \"pretty\") with only 10 games and a handful of sales to its name.\nIn short, it's a pretty rare bit of kit.

          "description": "Hey! Broom heads!\nWith the original Double Dragon, Yoshihisa Kishimoto realised a dramatic, violent expedition to save a kidnapped girl from a miscreant petrol gang. Although the genre had already been established by Irem’s Kung-Fu Master several years earlier, the scores of enemies, weapons, multi-plane scenery, two-player functionality, and broad range of attacks made it the biggest arcade smash of 1987. Although its direct sequels were lacklustre, 1995's Double Dragon for the Neo Geo (a fighting game spin-off often known as Double Dragon ’95 to differentiate) was notable. Designed to tie in with the questionable US-produced Double Dragon movie, it remains a very good game. Difficult, perhaps, with thankless AI, but the mechanics and balancing saw it played competitively far and wide. Sadly, the series didn’t revisit the fighting game format until 2002, when Rage of the Dragons surfaced as a late Neo Geo contender.\nOriginally meant to be a sequel to the aforementioned 1995 release, licensing issues had Rage of the Dragons end up outside of canon despite featuring two brothers named Billy and Jimmy… Lewis. Its roots, however, are obvious, and it's still recognised by many as being part of the overall Double Dragon universe.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Rather than take on the Ghibli-inspired visual style or Link's Awakening-esque toy look that we have seen a handful of times before (to no less impressive results, we might add), Vasge is playing to his strengths and imagining the game with fine-line hand-drawn visuals.

Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.\nBut when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.\nRead more",

          "description": "The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

          "description": "Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

          "description": "There must be hundreds of typewriters in the hall, their collective clacks a tidal wave of soulless automation, rising up to greet agent Kiran Estevez as she enters, pistol and flashlight in hands. Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.\n“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.\nRead more",

Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.\nUntil then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that.

With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat.

The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally.

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings.

There you can find:\n\n\n\nAll NPCs and interactable objects, along with their purpose.\n\n\nA detailed map with important locations marked on it.\n\n\nList of all weapons, accessories, and breathing styles, along with the info on where to find them.\n\n\nLoot tables for each chest type and item drop rates for them.\n\n\nDescriptions of all the families in the game.\n\n\n\nWhat is The Slayer Online Discord?\n\n\nIf the Trello board is missing some information that you need, the rest of the Slayer Online community is there to help you out. On the SO's Discord, you can ask questions and interact with others in the #general-chat and #questions channels. If you have any cool ideas for the game, make sure to share them with the developers in the #suggestions channel.\n\n\nHow to Best Search The SO Discord and Trello?\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nBecause both the Discord and the Trello contain so much information, you can always look for something specific by using their respective search tools. On Trello, you can use the filters option (F key), while on Discord, you can use search at the top right. If you want to search a specific channel, go to it, and then use the Ctrl+F combo.\n\n\nI hope the above information helps you throughout your journey in this Demon Slayer-inspired Roblox experience.

          "description": "Sakamoto Days' anime adaptation has long been announced, but a new announcement finally revealed its specific release date. The anime's official website released its main promotional video detailing the official premiere date, runtime, and opening theme.\n\n\nAccording to the promotional video, Sakamoto Days will start airing in Japan on January 11, 2025. It will air for two consecutive cours, with the second cour starting in July 2025. Award-winning musician Vaundy, who wrote Chainsaw Man's ending theme, \"Chainsaw Blood,\" composed the anime's opening theme, \"Hashire SAKAMOTO.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe anime's official social media handle also releases the anime's key visual, showcasing the anime's key characters. \n\n\n\n\nAbout Sakamoto Days anime\n\n\nTMS Entertainment is handling the anime adaptation, with Masaki Watanabe directing it.

          "description": "Hooded Horse has announced that Long Jaunt’s noble family management game, Norland, has reached Patch 26. This one might be the largest yet, as it adds family trees, new NPCs, and – perhaps most notably – an overhaul to the world map.\n\n\nNorland launched into early access in kind of rough shape. The framework was there, but I found it to be unbalanced and required too much juggling to really enjoy. As I described it in my early access review, none of its facets have any time to breathe, leading to things breaking down.\n\n\nSince the time I played it, the devs have been hitting it hard and fast with updates to address player concerns. The gusto is admirable. I haven’t jumped back into the game since my initial encounter, but I have seen certain tweaks that seem like they would make things more palatable. Things like cutting down on the amount of babysitting the peasants need.\n\n\nImage via Hooded Horse\n\n\nHere’s what information I have on the update: “The latest update for Norland completely overhauls the world map with new sprites, more topology, and more regional diversity. Players will start each game battling for control over a single region before transitioning to the “world” stage and fighting over nation-states of different cultures. The overall map size is also bigger now, and a previous patch allows players to compel nearby vassals to tackle distant issues, freeing their own nobles to focus on matters closer to home.”\n\n\nOn top of that, an added family tree means you can keep track of your lineage so that, I don’t know, you can keep second cousins from marrying each other. If you can stop them. There are also new “guest” NPC characters such as cultists and pilgrims. I’m not sure why “guest” is in quotes, but that’s how it is in the press release.\n\n\nNorland is currently in Early Access and available on PC. Also, it's on sale for 35% until December 4, 2024.\n\nThe post Noble simulator Norland gets a map overhaul with Patch 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll be able to leap into Miraland and dress up all fancy when Infinity Nikki launches worldwide on December 5, 2024.\n\n\nFollowing up on last month's closed beta, Infinity Nikki has its sights set on PlayStation 5, PC, and iOS and Android devices. You can see some of the colorful open world and sample pop artist Jessie J's theme song, \"Together Til Infinity,\" in the release date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nKentaro Tominaga—who previously worked on Nintendo titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, among others—is at the helm for this one. Infinity Nikki lets players explore the world of Miraland, taking on puzzles, digging up secrets, and putting on their fiercest duds for fashion contests. \n\n\nThere are other characters to meet, and story quests to accept along the way. It all looks and sounds like a pretty pleasant little adventure, with more dress than stress on the menu. If you didn't get a chance to see how it plays during the recent beta, you'll be able to set out on this delightfully poppy adventure early next month. \n\n\nAnd yes, that song is going to be in my head for the rest of the day, too. It's definitely fitting for something that bills itself as \"the coziest open-world game.\" \n\nThe post Infinity Nikki global release date locked in for December 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fans of Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin are eating good today. Three separate new projects were revealed for the series, including a mobile game, a new console game, and an anime sequel. \n\n\nThe rice-growing action-RPG that started it all first launched in 2020, with XSEED Games and Marvelous publishing the Edelweiss-developed title. It went on to inspire a TV anime adaptation, which ran for 13 episodes starting in July 2024. The anime is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Netflix, and more is in the works.\n\n\nDetails on the anime sequel are about as light as the games. Masayuki Yoshihara (The Eccentric Family) directed the first season, with Jukki Hanada (Nichijou, Sound! Euphonium) writing and Mio Fujishima handling character designs for the P.A. Works production. So far, we just have teaser art by original character designer Ryota Murayama, with one character visual representing each of the three projects. \n\n\n\n\nThe new console game is a spin-off titled Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation. Edelweiss is handling development once again, and XSEED Games already announced plans to publish the new entry in North America. According to the press release, this story follows Sakuna's close friend Princess Kokorowa, a \"high-ranking goddess presiding over wheels and inventions from her heavenly home.\"\n\n\nCheck out a brief teaser:\n\n\n\n\nThis all comes hot on the heels of the first game's fourth anniversary, which fell on November 12. Hopefully, we'll learn more about all three projects soon. \n\nThe post Sakuna: of Rice and Ruin reveals new spin-off, mobile game, and anime sequel appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk!

Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly.

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
