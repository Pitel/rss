          "description": "The good, the bad, and the ugly.\nIt seems like an absurd notion these days, but after Tomb Raider made its debut in 1996, developer Core Design pumped out six mainline entries over the next eight years – six. It’s true that teams were able to turn projects around much more quickly in those days, as evidenced by franchises such as Resident Evil and Final Fantasy, but it was also a clear indication of just how popular Lara Croft had become, and how much publisher Eidos Interactive wanted to milk the series to within an inch of its life.\nThe story goes that Core Design had grown weary of Tomb Raider by the time it commenced work on the fourth entry, The Last Revelation. Though keen to wean off Lara Croft and be done with the series, the team was ordered by Eidos to press on with even more Tomb Raider games. So while one group of devs reworked scrapped ideas from The Last Revelation to produce Tomb Raider: Chronicles, another moved development to the PS2 and began work on The Angel of Darkness.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Expects minimal financial impact.\nEarlier this month, the current U.S. administration implemented an additional 10% tariff on all goods imported into the country from China. While the full effect of this increase is yet to be seen, it poses a potential price hike for consoles and accessories developed in China, which, naturally, is a cause for concern to both consumers and developers.\nAcknowledging this, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that the company is looking into the potential impact that the tariffs could have on the upcoming financial year and the launch of the Switch 2. As reported by Reuters (and translated by Nintendo Everything), Furukawa explained in a press conference that the company is \"predicting various geopolitical risks and establishing ways to respond\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Not Abyssmal.\nDuring Sony’s February 2025 State of Play presentation, the big shadow drop was Koei Tecmo’s Warriors: Abyss, which offers a low-budget, roguelite take on the popular Warriors hack ‘n’ slash formula. The good news is that this genre hybrid feels like both halves fit perfectly together—the mindlessness of the combat mixed with the brief run-focused nature of roguelite action is so good that it almost feels hard to believe that the team never thought to produce something like this earlier. The bad news is that its struggles with repetition keep it from being anywhere near as addictive as roguelikes such as Dead Cells or Slay the Spire. Luckily, Warriors: Abyss still proves itself to be a worthwhile new entry in the series, but only just.\nWarriors: Abyss begins with you being summoned by an impish little god named Enma, the king of Hell, who was recently deposed when an ancient evil being named Gouma was released and took over the land of the dead. Eager to reclaim his throne, Enma enlists the stars of the Warriors franchise to fight off Gouma’s forces and ultimately send the creature back where it came from. Every now and then, Enma will pop up with a bit more of lore or some snarky quip, but there’s not much more to the storyline beyond this basic setup.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Update: Attorney weighs in on Nintendo's mostly-rejected patent.\nWe have been following Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit for the best part of six months now, and while we have grown to have a better understanding of the particular patents involved, all of the infringement claims have been tied to Japan. However, in recent months, it seems that Nintendo has been preparing to bring the lawsuit stateside, with a handful of applications now appearing in the US Patent Office.\nAs reported by Games Fray, Nintendo has had three patent applications approved in the US in recent months — no. 12179111 in December 2024, 12194382 in January, and 12220638 earlier this week on 11th February. While the middle of the three doesn't appear to be all that relevant to the Palworld case (it was filed in 2022 and is all about exchanging items with other players), the remaining two were filed after Palworld's launch and specifically detail creature-catching mechanics — the specifics of which appear to be integral to the lawsuit in Japan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But how often does the company let those developers speak freely about the games they make?\nLast year we got the opportunity to chat with the legendary artist Takaya Imamura, famous for Star Fox, Captain Falcon and the many machines in F-Zero, and even Majora’s Mask itself. He was with Nintendo for over 30 years working on countless games until leaving the company in 2021 to pursue something different.

(Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled \"Admire\", \"Joke\", \"Coerce\" and \"Boast\", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. \nYou have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying \"pie\" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not one of the hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a gamedev community knockabout dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement.

A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.\nRead more",

The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.\nRead more",

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!\nNic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?\nJames: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.\nOtherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.\nNic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to \"come hither\" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.\nIt's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?\nRead more",

I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.\nBut, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.\nIgnore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.\n \nRead more",

The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.\nAs of September last year, the musical-with-guns had \"recouped most of its development and marketing expenses\", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. \"October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2,\" says the report.\n \nRead more",

They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as \"completely abrupt and impersonal\". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.\n Read more",

          "description": "Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO \"fake\", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.\nThis follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.\nRead more",

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.\nWe’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment.

          "description": "True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

Forgotlings, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a Steam demo.

          "description": "I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game's creator Venris on YouTube. He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around \"eight to 12 hours a day\", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as \"Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon\". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.\nRead more",

I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.\nAs the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

Green brings up the rear in terms of sorcerous sundries with only 32 Wizard creatures. But all colors feature at least 30 Wizards, so it’s a creature type that you’re sure to run into when playing Commander – but what are the best Wizard cards for the format?\n\n\nGrab your floppy pointed hats, a wand, a staff, a spellbook, or whatever talisman you need to help hone your spellcasting abilities, and let’…",

While these characters are pretty powerful for beginners, there are better ones to unlock for the future. Every hero offers unique abilities and buffs, and they can be unlocked by earning in-game resources.\n\n\nHow to get all characters in Warriors: Abyss\n\n\nTo start the process, you'll have to play with one of the 21 characters available. However, you'll notice a section called Hall of Bonded Souls. It's impossible to miss as the tutorial will also describe it to you. You'll be able to unlock and add new heroes from this section and use them on your quests.\n\n\nYou'll need a currency called Karma Embers. You can earn this currency whenever you complete a run, and the number will vary based on difficulty. You'll also earn this currency by unlocking different chests during the runs.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you've obtained Karma Embers, you'll be able to unlock the heroes and then use them during a run. Some, like Daqiao, are really cheap to unlock, as you'll need between 100-200 Karma Embers. Others, like Nobunaga Oda, are towards the higher end and cost 4000 Karma Embers or more. Of course, any hero, once unlocked, will remain available for all runs.\n\n\nOnce you have enough Karma Embers, you'll be able to \"Form Bond\" to unlock the character.\n\n\nUnlocking all the available characters will take time, but you should focus on some of the more meta ones for starters. They will help you go deeper on your runs and obtain more rewards. Make sure to check out our guide on the tier list for all starter heroes.\n\n\nHere's a guide if you're looking for a summary of all the unlockable characters and how much they cost to unlock.\n\nThe post How to unlock Heroes in Warriors: Abyss appeared first on Destructoid.",

The emote makes the character dance smoothly and playfully to \"Whole Lotta Choppas\" by Sada Baby. Curious to see how Wanna See Me looks in action? Check out the in-game animation in the video below.\n\n\n\n    \nVideo by Destructoid\n\n\nWanna See Me is returning along with other highly requested ICON Series emotes such as Rollie, Evil Plan, and Chicken Wing It, which are all parts of different collaborations between Epic Games and artists. Fortnite’s ICON Series emotes, especially those tied to music artists, tend to have limited availability due to licensing agreements. These deals often prevent Epic Games from re-releasing emotes unless they renegotiate with the original partners. This is why some emotes, like Wanna See Me, return after years of absence, while others remain missing for even longer.\n\n\nWhile Wanna See Me has become rare after this long wait of two and a half years, some players on social media were surprisingly unexcited about its return, but mostly because they'd rather see other emotes like Mine and Line Dancin'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ICON Series emotes even rarer than Wanna See Me include Head Banger from the Travis Scott set, last seen over 1,700 days ago (almost five years), and Lazer Blast, a Major Lazer dance last seen 1,345 days ago (almost four years).

As well as being able to face off against the Germans, you'll also be fighting against an \"army of the dead.\"\n\n\nAlso rabbits and rats, for some reason\n\n\nThe mod itself – which will have both singleplayer and co-op elements – puts you in the shoes of the good old-fashioned \"British Tommies,\" battling against the forces of evil, with eyeling saying that some of the maps have been based on real-life battles and locations, such as the Charge at the Somme and the First Battle of Gaza.\n\n\nYou'll come up against such \"post-living\" foes as Undead Tommies (I think the image above shows one of them), as well as Trench Crawlers, which are said to \"feast on dying soldiers.\" Of course, this is a WWI simulator as well, so you'll also be having a bit of a set-to with the German army, which includes snipers, landmines, and artillery.\n\n\nIt seems as though this mod is aiming for a sense of realism in terms of warfare, but with a nice dollop of the supernatural thrown in there for good measure. It certainly seems like it's a far cry from what we come to expect from a Half-Life game at any rate.\n\nThe post This Half-Life mod reimagines the horror of the Great War trenches appeared first on Destructoid.",

So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.\nHave you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.\n>",
