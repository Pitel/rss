          "description": "The city that nevers sleeps.\nThese days, it feels like deckbuilding elements are finding their way into all kinds of roguelikes, but it’s not too often that you see new releases purely built around card games. City Wars: Tokyo Reign is one of those rare releases, and we’re pleased to report that it presents an interesting and unique take on CCG gameplay. There may be some minor rough edges to the experience, but it overall manages to provide an addictive and engrossing experience fans of card games won’t want to miss.\nThe cyberpunk narrative here plays second fiddle to the mechanics as you fight your way through a series of procedurally generated city districts to defeat ne'er-do-wells and reign supreme. Battles play out across a two-phase setup, alternating endlessly between the two until either you or your opponent dies. The first phase has each of you taking a few turns to lay cards out on your respective sides of the track, while the second phase consists of chronologically executing the effects of those cards. Each tick on the track represents one unit of time, and cards with a higher ‘duration’ will thus take up more ticks. Cards placed the farthest to the left will be the ones that are played first, so before you’re even considering any of the stats or effects of a card, you first need to consider both where you can fit it on the track and how early or late you want it to activate in the execution phase.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This Japan-only Game Boy peripheral can connect to a Japanese mobile phone and play certain Game Boy games online. They didn't sell very well back in the day, but trust fans to track this peripheral down to find an unusual way of using it. And, a security researcher has managed to use the adapter and Pokémon Crystal to take control of an opponent's Game Boy remotely.\nIn a chat with Vice's tech column Motherboard, Xcellerator shared his fascination with retro tech. So, with the annual Binary Golf Grand Prix — a competition to find \"the smallest file which will crash a specific program\" — Xcellerator wanted to use this adapter in his entry. Instead, what he ended up discovering was what he thinks is the very first case of 'remote code execution' (a hack where you can run any kind of code on a target device) using a Game Boy Color.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The result was fantastic — in a kind of deeply horrifying way — and the team has now dropped an update to the PC fan game which includes two new custom levels, an updated Peach's Castle design, and dialogue changes.\nShared on Twitter by GoldenEye world champion, @Graslu00, the playthrough video shows how the developers have transferred the title's signature gameplay into the Mario 64 level format. This time, instead of jumping on your enemies, you will have to contend with grenade-throwing Bob-ombs (presumably the equivalent to a human throwing a baby) and Koopas with machine guns. When we heard that the Mario movie would start shooting soon, this isn't what we expected.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "An in-game shop will be implemented.\nNintendo has announced a handful of new updates coming to its mobile racing game, Mario Kart Tour, throughout September. But one big change — coming in October — is that the game will no longer have gacha elements, instead opting for what it's calling a 'Spotlight Shop'.\nIf you've ever used a capsule toy machine or a gachapon machine, then you have a pretty good idea of what gacha games are like. They entice you to spend in-game currency — which you can either earn by playing the game or get by spending real money — to buy random in-game items. Popular games that use gacha include Genshin Impact, Dragalia Lost (which is sadly closing down in November), Fire Emblem Heroes (which is Nintendo's most-popular mobile game) and Pokémon Masters EX.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So imagine being one of the people who worked on the original game, seeing all of your work on-screen, prettied up and refined — it's likely exciting! But for former Namco Hometek game designer Scott Rogers, he was only met with disappointment when he reached the end of the remake to find that he — and the rest of the team on the original — hadn't been credited.\nSpeaking to our friends over at Time Extension, Rogers said that crediting the original staff should be a \"courtesy\". Rogers also told Jason Weesner and Hardy LeBel — who also worked on the team — of this, and expressed his frustration, because crediting the original staff is \"just the decent thing to do, right?\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.\nTo call Northern Journey \"retro\" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail.

Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action.

I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.\r\n\n\r\nVentura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as \"Project Code Name 'M'\" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.\r\n\n\r\nMeant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It's a gripping mix that's already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it's a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access. \nRead more",

The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. \r\n\n\r\nI actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy.

A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions.

There’s even a release date, September 27th, which will see AMD launch an initial salvo of four mid-to-high-end chips. These will aim to leapfrog Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors, several of which are among the best CPUs for gaming we’ve yet tried, with the aid of a new Zen 4 core design, DDR5/PCIe 5.0 support and some ambitious clock speed boosts.\nRead more",

          "description": "Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

          "description": "Minecraft Legends was first announced at Geoff Fest earlier this year, and a smidge more footage dropped again at a Nintendo Direct Mini. But despite both of these events, it's been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there's been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.\nColour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year's Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft's colourful cube-verse.\nRead more",

          "description": "Eight years ago Graham (who used to be to blame for all of this) got hands-on with Dead Island 2, back when the game was being developed by Yager, the folks behind Spec Ops: The Line. Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.\nSo going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.\nRead more",

Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Atlas Fallen is an upcoming action RPG being developed by Deck 13 Interactive, the folks behind The Surge games. It's eschewing the robotic antics of its predecessor in favour of a Middle Eastern-inspired semi-open world filled with towering blocks of sand, rolling dunes, and mahoosive beasties.\nI managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it's shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I've got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,\" explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

          "description": "Step 1: Go Fast - Step 2: Actually understand what you're buying\nThe initial rollout of Sonic Frontiers information was messy, to say the least. After a series of confusing videos that didn't exactly showcase the game in the best light, we finally got a look at Cyber Space, and a glimpse into the narrative. This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer (which re-iterates the November 8 release date) basically compiles all of that into one digestible package.\nClocking in at roughly three minutes, this new video from the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube account is actually pretty helpful! It starts at the literal beginning, with Sonic, Amy, and Tails chilling, before they're \"sucked into a dimensional portal to Cyber Space, then ends up on the Starfall Islands.\" It then moves into a mechanical perspective, talking up its open world (which it calls \"open-zone platforming\") and \"the freedom to play the game in the order that matches your playstyle.\" A slight overview of the combat system and in-game puzzles are also touched on.\nThere's also a crucial part that actually talks about how critical path story progress is made. You'll defeat bosses to earn \"Portal Gears,\" which in turn unlock Cyber Space stages. Once you finish challenges therein, you'll then earn keys that can be used to unlock Chaos Emerald vaults to \"progress farther in the game.\" That seems to be the loop!\nHopefully that can last for —I'm going to guess — 10-15 hours, and beyond? Either way, they should have led with some of these videos (especially Cyber Space) out of the gate.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leLnp4XCBr4\nThe post This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer tells you everything you need to know appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Unearthed Treasure\nTokyo Game Show is yet to officially get underway, but already it seems that some of its surprises are just too durn exciting to keep under wraps — According to a new leak uncovered by Gematsu, legendary shmup developer Treasure is getting set to reveal a new project under the banner of one of its best-loved IPs, Radiant Silvergun.\nGematsu found evidence of a new Radiant Silvergun title after poking around the TGS website uploaded by publisher Happinet. Alongside assets and titles pulled from over 30 franchises was a brand new logo simply depicting \"Radiant Silvergun\", complete with a silhouette of the game's iconic starship. Treasure, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, will apparently be showcasing the new title at this year's TGS, which will no doubt get retro game fans and shmup aficionados into a suitable tizzy.\nRadiant Silvergun was released in Japanese arcades in May 1998, before finding its way onto the Sega Saturn in the console's twilight years. For the longest of times, it would remain something of an urban legend among western players, available only via expensive imports and poor early-day emulation. The classy shmup would eventually be ported to Xbox 360 in 2011, which represented the title's first, readily available, global release. Today, Radiant Silvergun still stands proud, holding a deserved reputation as a genuine classic of the genre.\nWhat form this project will take remains to be seen, but I would think a remaster or remake is more likely than a sequel. In either case, we won't have to wait too much longer to find out, as Tokyo Game Show will kick off September 15, emanating from Chiba's Makuhari Messe complex. We will bring you all of the details from Radiant Silvergun (and many other TGS exclusives) right here on Destructoid.\nThe post New Radiant Silvergun project leaks ahead of Tokyo Game Show appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'll take a gamble on it\nMario Kart Tour gacha is no more, at least come \"late September,\" according to a new update from the game's official Twitter account.\nHere's the full rundown:\n\"Here's a peek at #MarioKartTour's update coming late September! Battle mode will be added, along with a Spotlight Shop, where you can exchange rubies for drivers, karts, and gliders! Also, pipes you can fire by using rubies will be removed. See the notification for details.\"\n\nSo checking out that notification on the app, it seems as if \"new drivers, karts, and gliders, as well as drivers, karts, and gliders that have appeared in the past, will be available.\" This \"Spotlight Shop\" system will likely work similarly to the Fornite (and company) spotlight shops, which only showcase a few things to buy at a time: in a bid to get you to keep checking out the storefront and buy something before it leaves. The in-game update also says \"lots of other things are in the works too.\"\nObviously, a lot of games still have gacha elements, and clearly (in addition to this primarily being a business decision rather than some gift on high) this helps Nintendo enter into markets that don't currently allow it. But for folks who didn't like the gambling element of Mario Kart Tour gacha, it's a win.\nThe post In a rare move, Mario Kart Tour removes its gacha system appeared first on Destructoid.",

We have a lot of great things that we’ve done this year and a lot of great things for the future as well. The success of movie two has been really amazing and it really brought a lot of people into the audience. So we thank everyone for enjoying movie two. We had the release of Sonic Origins right after that. We have the release of Sonic Frontiers coming up on November 8, and we also have the Netflix TV show, Sonic Prime, coming up this winter.\"\n\n\"The Netflix show\" is none other than Sonic Prime, which is rumored to be out in December of this year (and the whole \"winter\" statement helps reconfirm that). That short list above also doesn't account for some other Sonic-related happenings, so let's recap them below.\nWhat does 2022 have in store for Sonic?\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 (movie)\nSonic Origins\nSonic Frontiers\nSonic Prime (TV show)\nUpdates for Sonic Forces and Sonic Dash mobile, which are still in operation\nMore Sonic collabs in games like Roblox and Fall Guys\nMore merch collabs\nAnother Sonic Symphony concert in October\nFrom a broader perspective, I can easily see what he's saying. Sonic Origins didn't have the best launch, and Frontiers really has an uphill battle to prove itself, especially after Forces. But if you count the wide success of the Sonic 2 film and add in a major Netflix series on the way, things get a little more exciting for Sonic fans as a whole.\nThe post Sonic producer says 2022 will be the biggest year for Sonic appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "They're available until September 6 at 6PM PT\nMore Kirby icons are now live for Nintendo's Switch Online reward system, with a new suite from Kirby's Dream Buffet.\nAs you may recall, Dream Buffet dropped in a low-key manner a few weeks ago for $15 on the eShop. Given the relatively short amount of time from its announcement to launch, a lot of folks were confused as to what the game even was and/or if it was free-to-play. Much to the delight of many, it ended up being a fully premium game with no microtransactions, and a host of unlocks. If the online functionality is shored up, it could become even more enticing as a longer-term party game.\nEither way, the Dream Buffet subseries is now in full swing, and these Switch icons prove it. While they're mostly Kirby (the character) related, they're also showing off multiple iterations of the Puffball, akin to all the alternate versions of Yoshi in games like Mario RPG or Yoshi's Island/Super Mario World. On top of that, you can pick up Dream Buffet's version of an item block (like Mario Party), as well as an icon for Elfilin from Kirby and the Forgotten Land. You can pick them up from now through September 6 at 6PM PT.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThe post Nintendo just added more Kirby icons to Switch Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Naughty but NIS\nWith Tokyo Game Show 2022 bearing down on us, publishers on both sides of the Pacific are preparing to drop a fresh round of updates and reveals from their upcoming catalogs. NIS America is the latest to tease an upcoming showcase, which will take place on the morning of Wednesday, September 7.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuokBsXyLSI\nWhile the publisher did not drop any hints as to which titles and localization it will bring to the party, we can expect to see no less than four new game announcements. NIS America is obviously notable for its standard practice of localizing Japanese releases and bundling together classic JRPGs for modern platforms. But we'll simply have to wait and see what the publisher has up its sleeve for 2023.\nThe NIS America Showcase will premiere on the official NIS America YouTube channel, on September 7, at 08:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 16:00 BST. The stream will be followed by an aftershow, which will feature chats with developers, as well as a competition to win a one-of-a-kind artwork reproduction taken from one of the day's revealed titles. We will, as always, bring you all of the exciting details right here on Destructoid.\nNIS America's next release is the compendium Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol 3, which compiles the quirky releases La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure. It launches on Nintendo Switch tomorrow.\n\nThe post NIS America to reveal new games in video showcase next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "They're out in Free Title Update 2\nMore Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak quality of life updates are on the way, according to a new tweet from Capcom.\nThe tweets showcase a change to shortcut loadouts, which will increase the threshold of the mechanic to eight slots in all. We'll also be getting a long-awaited \"lock\" mechanic, which will let you sidestep accidentally selling or crafting armor pieces you don't want to get rid of. This has been a thing for many years in many high-profile games with inventory management, and it's very much welcome with Rise.\nNote that this is all coming in the next major Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak update. Title Update 2 will arrive in \"late September,\" and we'll likely get full confirmation soon, including a stream to show it off. Capcom has been running a thankfully predictable and effective hype campaign for these updates.\nAs a reminder, Title Update 1 already arrived on August 10 on both PC and Nintendo Switch. This is in addition to regular patches, which are separate from content-heavy title updates, and typically focus on bugs. In other words, the team has been pretty busy! All of this work is clearly translating into sales, as Sunbreak alone (not to mention the success of Rise) is climbing Capcom's Platinum Title (million-seller) list week after week.\nhttps://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1564924449681543176\nThe post Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak team teases more quality of life updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

WayForward's remaster sees the scrolling brawler officially localized for the west for the very first time, while sporting a freshly translated script, new manga cutscenes, and an amusing intro song by River City Girls series composer Megan McDuffee.\nAs a game... welllll... it has to be said that time has not been too kind to Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which was already quite dated by brawler standards even in 1994. But, as a little piece of franchise history, it's still nice to see the long-lost title get some time in the spotlight. This release, of course, will also serve as an appetizer to WayForward's long-awaited sequel River City Girls 2, which will be gracing us with its presence at some point later in 2022.\nRiver City Girls Zero launches on PlayStation and Xbox platforms September 13, with PC (Steam) to follow on September 22. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch. Be sure to check out our thoughts on the remaster right here, along with our recent interview with Megan McDuffee!\nThe post River City Girls Zero brings the pain on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Say hello to the newest addition to the Paldea region\nFollowing several posts teasing the news, we're seeing the newest addition to the Paldea region. Grafaiai is a new Pokemon debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.\nGrafaiai is categorized as the \"Toxic Monkey\" Pokemon. It's naturally a Poison/Normal Type, and is pretty tiny.\nAccording to the Pokemon page, Grafaiai is a moody Pokemon with a \"fastidious\" disposition. It's a bit of a loner, and usually gets caught up in territorial fights with other Pokemon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yrrF83tnY0\nGrafaiai is nocturnal, and covers its hands in poison to mark patterns on trees as part of securing its territory. This poisonous saliva can paralyze Bug Pokemon, which Grafaiai can then collect up. Better keep your Butterfree away from it!\nThe saliva can change color based on what Grafaiai eats, and becomes concentrated when the little guy senses danger. I'm guessing by the name that Grafaiai is based on an Aye-Aye, which also forages for food and has incredibly long fingers.\n\nAnother addition to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet\nThis adds to the list of new Pokemon arriving in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Alongside the Pokemon Grafaiai, we've also seen newcomers like Lechonk and Fidough, who both overtook the internet with their adorable designs.\nWhile Grafaiai doesn't seem to have the same ability to accost social media's attention, I think it's a neat design. And hey, another painter Pokemon to hang out with Smeargle.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet are due to arrive on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch, with a host of features in tow. From riding a Legendary Pokemon as a bike to co-op adventures, it certainly seems like a very different Pokemon journey. Hopefully we'll see some more new Pokemon, and maybe even some neat new regional variants for Paldea, in the run-up to November.\nThe post New Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Pokemon revealed as Grafaiai appeared first on Destructoid.",

Right on: are we sure Nintendo got the announcement correct?\nAs spotted by NintendoSoup, the upcoming duo of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet were lumped together as just Violet in the Singapore ad, which adorns every tray at this particular location (and likely more). Interestingly, the collab also involves a \"Charizard McPepper Burger,\" \"Eevee Pies,\" and \"Pikachu and Scorbunny Frappes.\" Oh, and it'll have a trading card game tie-in.\nThis silly snafu had me thinking about how much I appreciated a lot of high-level choices in Pokemon Legends. Of course, there's room for improvement there. But in addition to the new capture mechanic, the idea of just buying one game and being done with it was a relief, especially for completionists.\nThe continuation of the dual game method has become a hot-button issue in recent years, especially since the series moved off of its exclusive home on handhelds. \"More money\" is a chief contributor to keeping that gravy train rolling, but the original Red and Blue idea of encouraging trading via the community did make sense. But with cold online trading as commonplace, the logistics of pushing two versions with every generation makes less and less sense.

Discovery confirms. \nThe first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: \n\nFor more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy.

Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours?

Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",

That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. \nIn the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase.

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years.

Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.\nFrozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. \n\n\nOn September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  \nNobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”",

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok.

First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. \nThe story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. \n\n\nWanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?
