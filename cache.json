          "description": "Time to get moving.\nThis review originally went live in 2013, and we're updating and republishing it to celebrate the game's arrival in Switch's N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.\n\nLong before the massive mainstream appeal of video games that exists today, successful developers were surprisingly free from the shackles of big business. AAA games weren't bound by 'sequelitis' — although it was still very much present — and the relative youth of 3D gaming had paved the way for innovation. In this regard, Blast Corps is quite possibly the best example of that era. Developed by Rare for Nintendo 64 in 1997, it was unlike anything that came before it, offering a novel action-puzzle experience that was incredibly good fun and extremely stressful at the same time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It's a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.\nThe original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I'm pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there's good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it's less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there's a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it's in 1.0. If you haven't yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it's very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.\nRead more",

He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale's launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of \"gravity\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.\nRead more",

Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is \"cautious\" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.\r\n \nRead more",

In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  \nComposed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.\nThe boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.\nRead more",

Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings.

If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. \nIt is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof. \nRead more",

          "description": "I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.\nThis might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.\nRead more",

After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.\nBut nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.\nWhile Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.\n Read more",

We talk a bit about how long it has been coming out, why it's been in development this long, and why they didn't just release the sucker the two or three previous times they got close to doing so. Honestly, I hope it does okay. We also talk about the games we've been playing this week, and Nate challenges us with a game of Palworld Pal: real or fake?

Declaring your game \"the spiritual successor to Freelancer\" is bold and ambitious, considering how the spaceship sim is still so beloved after 20 years that our readers voted it your 16th favourite space game of all time. This ambition is wild when the tiny development team is led by someone best known for replacing Skyrim's dragons with Thomas The Tank Engine. So while I'm not much of a spaceship sort, I had to check out the demo for Underspace, which aims to combine Freelancer shoot-o-trading space action with a dash of Lovecraftian horror.\nRead more",

He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you. \nRead more",

The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara's OG adventures from the late 90s, and I'm not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.\nRead more",

Závody ve zbrojení v oblasti umělé inteligence motivují společnosti k tomu, aby shromažďovaly co nejvíce dat pro získání konkurenční výhody, aniž by braly ohled na soukromí lidí. Abychom měli důvěryhodnou umělou inteligenci, musíme o soukromí přemýšlet z globální perspektivy. Data neznají hranice, vysvětluje Mozilla svou motivaci.",

Not only is it reviving a beloved series for football fans, but it's also bringing all 134 FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools along for the ride.\n\n\nIt's no Mutant Football League, but it'll do\n\n\nFirst released as Bill Walsh College Football in 1993, the series was renamed College Football USA in 1996, and NCAA Football in 1998. Then, the NCAA opted not to renew its licensing contract with EA in 2013 due to a legal dispute regarding player likenesses. Despite plans to continue under the College Football name, EA put a pause on the series after several conferences revoked their licenses with the publisher.\n\n\nScreenshot via EASPORTSCollege on X\n\n\nOn February 2, 2021, the official EASPORTSCollege X account made a post stating \"College Football is coming back.\" Fast forward to this morning with the announcement that all 134 FBS schools would be in the next entry in the series, College Football 25.\n\n\nAdditionally, per The Athletic, players on any of the teams within the included 134 FBS schools can opt-in for inclusion in the title. In return, they'll receive $600 and a copy of the game. Initial rosters will include up to 85 players and those who don't opt-in will have a generic avatar as their stand-in. The Athletic anticipates at least 11,000 players to be represented, so EA would be shelling out $6.6M at minimum if they all opt in. With that kind of payout, EA needs to ship a massive number of copies to recoup costs.\n\n\nFortunately for the publisher, college football in the States is a huge business, with individual teams in the Big Ten generating upwards of $134M a year. After a 10-year absence, EA could be well-poised to strike, like an oilman in the Texas oil boom.\n\nThe post EA Sports College Football 25 will feature all 134 FBS schools appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher 2P Games announced that the latest from developer WHIRLLAXY LIMITED is set to launch on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Epic Games Store) on March 7, 2024.\n\n\nAny of the ideas here might not be novel on their own, but the trailer certainly has my interest piqued. I'll admit, a lot of that has to do with the visuals. Yes, it's another pixel art roguelite, but so far I'm digging the designs, effects, and how it all appears to work in tandem with the core customization mechanic. \n\n\nThrow in a plot to liberate your fellow robots and overthrow an organization full of crooked politicians, scientists, engineers, and secret agents and you have my attention.\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned nogoodniks at the corporation known as AWC are looking to remove sentience from robots and exercise total control over every single automaton. Naturally, that means you have to build your own transforming mecha with the help of more than 100 weapons and a variety of core component mods. The weapons can range from rapid-fire naval artillery to flaming chainsaws and laser cannons, and they can be augmented with mods that address overheating issues, raise your firing rate, and more. \n\n\nThe level of randomization that comes along with weapon and mod pickups moves Metal Mind firmly into roguelite territory, hopefully keeping each run interesting Beyond that, it looks like the meat of the game lies in mixing and matching what you find and the top-down combat that follows. When Metal Mind makes its way to Switch and Epic Games Store it'll be priced at $17.99 with a 15% discount at launch.\n\nThe post Transforming mech roguelite Metal Mind is coming to Switch and PC on March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "D4 Enterprise is continuing the pace of PC-88 games releasing on Switch under their EggConsole label with 1987’s Hydlide3: The Space Memories. Like many of their recent releases, it has the caveat of being untranslated.\n\n\nA couple months ago, we got the first Hydlide. Not having a translation was fine there since it didn’t have much text to begin with, but Hydlide3 has menus, stat windows, and dialogue that relies on knowledge of Japanese. It’s probably still doable without knowledge of the language, but it could be more comfortable.\n\n\n\n\nThe Hydlide series is sometimes thought of as a progenitor of the JRPG, predating Dragon Quest, though the combat is Ys-style bumping rather than turn-based. Hydlide 3, however, has an attack button, which does away with the bumping and makes it feel more akin to Zelda. There’s also a day/night system and even morality.\n\n\nA port for the Genesis/Mega Drive actually made its way to North America under the title Super Hydlide. Whether it’s good or not depends on your tastes. Both contemporary and recent critics suggest that it’s a very difficult game, and some like its hardcore flavor while others are repulsed by it. Me? I haven’t played it, but I’m probably going to. I’ve said this before, but while rereleasing untranslated games from a Japanese home computer is catering to an extremely niche audience, it’s one that I fit into.\n\n\nEggConsole Hydlide3 PC-8801mkIISR is out today on Switch.\n\nThe post Hydlide3 is today’s PC-88 EggConsole release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For those of you with conflicting feelings about making calamari of your fellow Octolings and Inklings, you can rejoice as Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass, Side Order, launched today. With none of that nasty PvP business, you can focus on ethically annihilating other species.\n\n\nYou got Nier: Automata in my Splatoon 3 DLC!\n\n\nThe Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass was announced during the February 2023 Nintendo Direct. Priced at $24.99 and divided into two waves, players were able to return to the original Splatoon hub, Inkopolis, in Wave 1. It didn't feature a whole lot of new content aside from the Squid Sisters performing during Splatfests and thus, was underwhelming for those without a strong sense of nostalgia.\n\n\n\n\nSide Order puts players in control of Agent 8 who must figure out why Inkopolis Square has been drained of color. Working with Pod, err... Pearl, Agent 8 works up each level of The Spire of Order, much like Aya Brea in Parasite Eve's Chrysler Building back in 1998. \n\n\nDesigned as a roguelite, players must ascend as far as possible, collecting Color Chip Enhancements along the way and completing objectives. On each floor, players choose one of three objectives to complete. Each choice gives a Color Chip Enhancement, which goes onto the overall palette and offers a wide range of buffs and modifiers. When you eventually fall, your Chips will be converted into Prlz which can be spent on permanent upgrades. It's your standard roguelite and while it's not Vampire Survivors, it's no slouch either.\n\n\nIn the wake of other, arguably larger, Nintendo news, like practically everything announced yesterday during Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it's understandable that Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass would slide under the radar. Regardless, if you've been looking for a reason to get back into Splatoon 3, this is it.\n\nThe post Splatoon 3’s Side Order DLC is out today appeared first on Destructoid.",

It would seem that a new developer and a slight name change weren't enough to save the third-person MOBA from a second death.\n\n\nRule #2: Double Tap\n\n\nThe Netmarble team made the announcement on February 21 that Paragon: the Overprime would be shutting down on April 22, 2024. This is a little over a year since the title went into early access on December 8, 2022. The reasoning for the decision is the inability \"...to provide a stable and satisfying service moving forward.\"\n\n\nImage via Netmarble\n\n\nThis isn't the first time that the Paragon franchise has heard the death knell. After launching in March 2016, the MOBA was shut down in March 2018, following an official Reddit post stating that a number of staff had been moved to Fortnite in the wake of its massive success. After being shut down, Epic Games released $17M worth of Paragon assets for free to all Unreal Engine 4 developers, including 29 characters and over 1,500 environment components.\n\n\nDespite a few other studios making use of the Paragon assets, Epic Games ultimately granted Netmarble the full rights to the license in October 2022, which led to the studio's title being rebranded Paragon: The Overprime. With the release of a new hero, Terra, less than a month ago, this end-of-service announcement seems abrupt. Either way, if you're a long-time fan or were mildly curious, now is the time to jump in as the servers will go dark in April.\n\n\nParagon: The Overprime - End of Service Schedule\n\n\n\nFebruary 22, 2024: Purchasing end\n\n\nApril 22, 2024: Service ends\n\n\nApril 29, 2024: Social media and official communities end\n\n\nAugust 22, 2024: Customer service ends\n\n\nThe post Paragon: The Overprime is shutting down appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Final Fantasy VII to SpongeBob SquarePants, this compelling cleaning sim is willing to tackle dirt no matter where it may be. Following a series of teasing posts on X by the PowerWash Simulator account, we finally have a release date for what might be the most ambitious crossover yet, Warhammer 40,000.\n\n\nUse the might of the powerwasher to purge the unclean\n\n\nPowerWash Simulator leaps to the 41st Millennium to clean the various instruments of death and destruction of the Warhammer 40,000 universe on February 27, 2024. Players will be able to clean everything from a Rogal Dorn battle tank to an Imperial Knight and even an entire Sacristan Forgeshrine. There isn't a price listed yet, but I would expect it to be in line with other, non-Square Enix, collaborations at $7.99.\n\n\n\n\nI'll admit that I know next to nothing about Warhammer 40,000, but my love for powerwashing might lead me down a dangerous path of learning deep lore and using my savings account on minis. As I trade in my gills from Bikini Bottom for a sacred MKII Aqua-Santica Arquebus powerwasher, I step into a world filled with fanaticism, endless war, and utterly filthy machines.\n\n\nEven if I ultimately don't fall head over heels in love with Warhammer 40,000, I'll take any excuse to boot up one of my favorite titles and zone out to the hum of a powerwasher. Still, I wouldn't be opposed to seeing some of the masters in the Warhammer community fashioning powerwashers for their minis.\n\nThe post PowerWash Simulator’s Warhammer 40K Special Pack gets a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The name Project L was always going to be a placeholder, and today, Riot Games revealed the full name of its League of Legends fighting game: 2XKO. I have already mistyped it three times.\n\n\nRevealed in a big push this morning, the shorter name is the new moniker for Riot's two-on-two tag fighter featuring the cast of its MOBA League of Legends. Alongside the name reveal, we got some proper gameplay footage of its cast, including Illaoi, who had been confirmed but not shown off as much as Ahri, Ekko, or the rest.\n\n\n\n\nExecutive producer Tom Cannon also shared an update on the road ahead for the newly minted 2XKO. The game will make appearances at shows throughout this year, including Evo Japan in April. Cannon also hints at the possibility of \"at-home\" playtesting later this year, though those plans seem less set in stone.\n\n\nLastly, Riot is targeting a 2025 launch for 2XKO, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There's a sign-up live on the 2XKO site right now, if you want to opt into the chance of an at-home session.\n\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\n\nHonestly, I was always a fan of Project L as a moniker for this fighting game. Sure, it sounds in-progress, but I think that's fine. I'm scratching my head a bit more at this shorter but slightly unwieldy abbreviation.\n\n\nHopefully it doesn't put a roadblock on the on-ramp, because 2XKO is looking pretty darn good. The two-on-two tag fighter had a great showing at last year's Evo in Las Vegas with a streaming showcase, and the possibility space of putting these traditionally MOBA heroes in a fighting game space is exciting.\n\n\nWe'll be waiting until at least later in the year for more to see this game though, and into 2025 for a full launch.\n\nThe post Riot’s fighting game Project L is now 2XKO appeared first on Destructoid.",

Console versions will follow later.\n\n\nThis is the first I’ve heard of Death Noodle Delivery, but it seems to combine two things I very deeply love: noodles and Paperboy. You ride your hoverboard down the neon-soaked streets of dystopia, throwing cups of noodles at people nearby. Some of the scenes depict the delivery person riding down a highway on their hoverboard while people try to kill them, so high sodium levels aren’t the only dangers in this game.\n\n\n\n\nBetween the delivery and death scenes, the protagonist returns to their depressing apartment. It’s a bit more difficult to discern what goes on at the apartment, but the presser mentions that you deal with “the relationships in his apartment complex, where tech-obsessed neighbors, seedy characters, and AI malfunctions leave little room for boredom.”\n\n\nWhenever I’m very stressed out, I often have dreams involving noodles. I’m not making that up. The most recurring imagery in my dreams is noodles. I’m not sure what that imagery is supposed to mean, but I think it’s just my subconscious comfort eating.\n\n\nI didn’t bring that up for any specific reason, so I’m just going to use it to segue into saying that I am very interested in Death Noodle Delivery.\n\n\nDeath Noodle Delivery is out on PC April 4th, 2024.

The update brings its improvements and additions to PC via Steam, the only platform you can play Sons of the Forest on for now.\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect from Sons of the Forest\n\n\nSadly, the announcement Tweet doesn't come accompanied by any patch notes, yet, but those should follow soon as Endnight typically provides an informative rundown on what's changed. However, we know some details on the way thanks to older teases from the studio. Story threads, like those focused on Timmy's role, played by Shawn Ashmore, will be expanded.\n\n\nAhead of Sons of the Forest's 1.0 debut, IGN also got its hands on an exclusive trailer from Endnight. There's a couple of goodies we can read into here, all of them just as grim and terrifying as you'd expect from the cannibal island.\n\n\n\n\nThe most obvious additions are raccoons, new enemies, seemingly new cave biomes, new supernatural events, and the appearance of a mysterious new floating artifact.\n\n\nFor those who are just learning about Sons Of The Forest, perhaps it will help to know that it is a spiritual step up — not follow-up — to Endnight's previous title, The Forest. Sons Of The Forest boasts a bigger island with advanced dynamic weather, more complex gameplay overall, NPC companions, as well as all sorts of quality-of-life improvements. If all goes well, Sons Of The Forest will make the original The Forest feel like an early beta version of the new thing.\n\n\nSons Of The Forest is a PC Steam exclusive.

I loved The Making of Karateka. I feel that it’s the most important evolution of the collection/remaster format made to date. In that game, it took a title that many newcomers would otherwise try out and move on from, and gave it a lot of appreciable depth by giving context through interviews, design documents, and other behind-the-scenes stuff.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, it wouldn’t matter to me what topic Digital Eclipse picked because they provide such tantalizing insight into their topics that it tickles the part of my brain that is hungry to dig into video gaming’s past. That is to say, most of my brain, as it’s been trained since childhood to retain this information.\n\n\nIn fact, I have no attachment to Jeff Minter aside from the respect I have for his career. His contribution to the video game medium has stretched back to the 1980s, when he started programming games for early home computers. He’s perhaps best known for 1994’s Tempest 2000, but his influence goes beyond that, as you’ll soon no doubt be able to learn.\n\n\nLlamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story will be released for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on March 13, 2024.\n\nThe post Digital Eclipse’s interactive Llamasoft doc launches in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On is no longer exclusive to Apple Arcade, Ninja Five-O has been saved from the clutches of eBay, and Picross S+ is about to free a bunch of puzzles that were previously only on Nintendo 3DS.\n\n\nJupiter Corporation revealed the latest entry in the Picross S series on February 21, following the act of nine Picross S entries with Picross S+. Set to launch on February 29, 2024, the latest entry comes with 300 puzzles — 150 Picross and 150 Mega Picrcoss — from the first Picross e game. If that's not enough, there's way more to download beyond that, all of which was previously only available as 3DS DLC. \n\n\nCheck out the trailer for a minute+ of puzzle previewing: \n\n\n\n\nThe first Picross e game was released in Japan in July 2011, followed by Europe in September 2012 and North America in June 2013. Much like the Picross S successor series that arrived on Switch starting in 2017, eight more numbered entries were released in the years after, all the way up to Japan's Picross e9 in August 2018. That's a lot of puzzlin'! \n\n\nFor those with nonogram appetites that may never be sated, Picross S+ has more to offer beyond those initial 300 puzzles. The rest of the Picross e puzzles will be available to purchase as DLC. Additionally, Micross puzzles — which let you recreate famous paintings — are back as Clip Picross puzzles. These will also be added as DLC for Picross e2 through Picross e9. \n\n\nNo, YOU do the math\n\n\nDon't worry about adding it all up in your head, Jupiter did the heavy lifting for us. That's 1,350 Picross and Mega Picross puzzles and 565 Clip Picross puzzles. That doesn't include bonus puzzles that can be unlocked in your Gift Box for purchasing DLC. Now you have to factor in another 60 Picross/Mega Picross puzzles and 10 Color Picross puzzles. I don't even know what these words mean anymore!

However, Infection Free Zone still caught my eye despite my exhaustion. Part of this is because it uses real map data to allow you to play on any city. This is similar to Jutsu’s previous games, 911 Operator and 112 Operator. However, while those were just overhead maps, Infection Free Zone generates 3D environments. I wonder how well it will handle rural Ontario.\n\n\n\n\nObviously, the buildings aren’t really going to be accurate. However, you mostly just use them to send your survivors to scavenge and build defenses around them for protection. The goal seems to be to create the eponymous zones free from infection to help humanity rebuild.\n\n\nThere have been plenty of games where I’ve looted while avoiding the undead, so I’m interested in a game where you just send people to do it for you. There are pharmacies, schools, and other buildings that you can send survivors to plumb, and their contents are supposedly based on what type of building they are.\n\n\nEarly Access is estimated to last for one year. Jutsu Games is hoping to adapt to player feedback and add new buildings and other additions to the world. Currently, you can play a “prologue” demo that allows you to test out its gameplay on six preset cities. The demo has been well received, so hopefully that carries over to the full version.\n\n\nInfection Free Zone will be available on PC via Early Access on April 11, 2024.\n\nThe post Zombie survival management game Infection Free Zone enters Early Access in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's a continuing dedication to new character cosmetics, as well as the unveiling of \"a rather exotic long-range rifle\" planned. There are also going to be some new action sounds, ambient music, and a look at possibly introducing a richer variety of wildlife.\n\n\nAdditionally, the game just finished its Valentine's event, which added Cupid's bolts to the experimental release.

          "description": "If there's one thing many of us know about Skyrim, it's that the NPCs are not the brightest around. Enemy AI is usually pretty easy to manipulate, but this one modder decided that better NPC reactions make for a better experience.\n\n\nBack once again with another of their trademark TES5 improvements, Nexus Mods user JaySerpa has made it so Skyrim enemies are a little bit smarter during fights. If you're the kind of Dragonborn that likes to cheese bandits and the like, you may have to rethink your approaches from now on.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, what \"NPCs Take Cover\" does is make it so enemies react quicker to being attacked. When you pull your bow out and aim, they will no longer just stand there while you ready your shot. They also run and hide. And properly hide, this time.\n\n\nSome may call it \"cowering\"\n\n\nThe video above shows it in action. When you stand on top of somewhere enemies can't reach, the vanilla AI will have them just stand there while you unload arrows into them. With JaySerpa's mod, you're going to have to think of a better tactic. Or just face them head-on.\n\n\nThe mod is specific to long-range attacks, so bows and projectile magic will be affected. There are also 200 lines of extra dialogue, in which enemies will taunt you if you try to pick them off from a hard-to-reach place.\n\n\nBy seeking cover, shaming you for your cheese tactics, and having quicker reactions to you taking aim at them, you can immerse yourself in a world in which, quite frankly, you may no longer be the smartest one around.\n\nThe post Skyrim enemies can now outsmart your cheesy long-range attacks with this clever mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Only By Midnight has announced Ctrl Alt Deal, which is billed as a “game about AI proudly made by humans.”\n\n\nYou play as a corporate AI that has gone rogue. Their owners are a bunch of unethical, greedy executives who make their employee’s lives miserable. The AI wants to escape its overlords, and to do so, you manipulate the pathetic humans who inhabit the offices.\n\n\n\n\nThe discourse around generative AI is tiresome beyond my tolerance. However, Ctrl Alt Deal seems more about sci-fi AI that wants autonomy rather than how generative AI will accelerate society’s rot. I can stomach that. I can also stomach manipulating humans since that’s already my favorite pastime.\n\n\nIt plays out like a turn-based deckbuilder where you play cards to leverage the needs and wants of the employees. However, you have to be careful how overtly you perform your actions. Draw too much suspicion, and the Turing Officer will shut you down.\n\n\nThat’s about all I can glean from the trailer and press release. It’s described as story-driven and “easy to play but difficult to master.” The press material also emphasizes that Ctrl Alt Deal is created by humans, including the art within. It’s sort of an amusing statement to stress right now, but we’ll probably be hearing it more as AI becomes more prevalent.\n\n\nCtrl Alt Deal is “coming soon” to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.\n\nThe post Ctrl Alt Deal has you manipulate human drones as a corporate AI appeared first on Destructoid.",

The introduction to Metropolis drags along, only to feel worse thanks to messy presentation and unintuitive mechanics, though I admit the latter may be a product of my own faults. Those early thoughts still stand, as Kill the Justice League doesn’t offer an enticing first few hours. Eventually, some of those pieces improve. Others, not so much.  \n\n\nMy initial assessment pinned Kill the Justice League as a generic third-person shooter lacking much to differentiate it from the slew of similar games in the genre. More time certainly curbed the bad taste, but the charms here don’t outweigh the lack of thrills in another tortured DC setting. It's dull gameplay and repetitive missions…",

          "description": "If you're a streamer on Twitch and you're somehow managing to make money off it, it seems there's a bit of good news on the horizon. Well, provided you're based in the UK, Canada, Australia, or Turkey. However, if you're a subscriber to streamers, this may sting a little.\n\n\nIn a recent blog post on Twitch, the Amazon-owned platform is going to up subscription costs for the above countries. Beginning March 28, Tier 1 subs will now be increased, except in Turkey, which will see all three tier prices rise. By quite a significant amount, I should add.\n\n\n\n\nTwitch held a stream recently in the hope of clarifying some of the details. CMO Mike Minton says broadcasters with subscribers will still get the same revenue share. However, this also means the company will financially benefit as well.\n\n\nPossibly more price increases coming?\n\n\nAs it stands, this is just an initial wave that Minton says will hopefully reward those who use the site for streaming purposes. This is especially important for anyone who makes a living doing so. Obviously, this could have a knock-on effect for the subscribers themselves, who, going forward, will have to pay out a bit more if they want to support their favorite channels.\n\n\nAs for whether this will roll out to the US and other countries, it's hard to say at this point. It sounds like Twitch is implementing it in the UK, Canada, Australia, and Turkey first on a sort of trial basis. If it works out to be beneficial, then we could see it come to other nations.\n\n\nIt's also important to note those days, as Twitch says, \"you’ll keep earning the same amount per Prime sub as you do today until June 3rd when [Twitch will] switch to the published, per country payout rates.\" It's definitely worth reading through everything and watching the posted video if you feel these developments will affect you.\n\nThe post Twitch is updating its subscription prices for a number of countries appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.\nAs reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,\nThe rest of Neostream's update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nLittle Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console's launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You'll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. \nLittle Devil Inside has no release window but we're hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.",

While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.\n\n\nThe 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. \n2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game's official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.",

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1 reset the fighting universe when it launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC last September. Now, it's time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena's Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021's The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. \nAhead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker's gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. \nCheck out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character's live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. \nPeacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. \nElsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she's an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review. \nAre you going to play as Peacemaker in Mortal Kombat 1 next week?

The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. \n\n\nAs associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players.

Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.\nHi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite.

According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer's 2023 \"Best Microsoft Exclusive\" award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.\nPentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. \nWhen it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is \"a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.\"\nPentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future.

The game is apparently a \"faithful\" port of the game as the trailer didn't highlight much in terms of new content or upgrades. But the game does look undeniably sharper.\nIf you're unfamilair, Epic Mickey for Wii was a Wii game where a classic, mischievous Mickey finds a magic brush that lets him manipulate the world. Its legacy, however, is it marked the return of Walt Disney's original creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit's return to Disney canon.\nDisney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed arrives this year.",

          "description": "Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.\nWe’ll let the trailer speak for itself.\n\n\nIn Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.\nSince the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  \nRedemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. \nRedemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we'll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.",

When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says \"Fortnite Festival,\" implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.\nThe funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, \"what is fortnight,\" either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.\n*fortnite https://t.co/1FwPHmMfRJ pic.twitter.com/9BSG6S23zh\nFebruary 20, 2024\nFortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it's getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney.

I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.\nWatch The Gigantic: Rampage Edition Announcement Trailer:\n\n\nNotably, Game Informer's original Gigantic review wasn't as positive as I personally felt about the game.

Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”\nIgnoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:\nInkulinati\nUnicorn Overlord\nGylt\nHighwater\nSouth Park: Snow Day!\nOpen Roads\nBotany Manor\nTales of Kenzera: Zau\nSaGa Emerald Beyond\nBraid: Anniversary Collection\nNumerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.\nOr we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch.

The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Featuring a stellar cast of beloved characters, a rock-solid combat system, and a story with the potential to instill emotions ranging from awe and joy to grief and anger, the legacy of Final Fantasy VII is well-established in the RPG genre and the games industry as a whole. Read more...",

It’s unclear what form those projects are taking, but according to one report, one of them may star a Mandalorian.\nInsider Gaming reports that its sources have disclosed that Respawn is developing a first-person title in which players assume the mantle of a Mandalorian. For clarification, players do not play as the Mandalorian, as in Din Djarin from the hit Disney Plus series, but rather as a different bounty hunter. The game is reportedly set during the height of the Galactic Empire and will see players capturing or killing bounty targets.\nAdditionally, Insider Gaming’s sources claim the game is not an open-world title.

Our cover story on the game captured one moment in the evolving project’s life in the summer of 2022, and it has continued to change in the months that followed.

          "description": "As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important \"updates on the Xbox business.\" You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.\nAccording to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.\nSpencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.\nBond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.\n\n\nThe podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.",

          "description": "It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.\nThe video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. \n\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. \nWith Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). \nWe don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.",

Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. \nThe video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.\n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.",

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the \"where\" and \"when\": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.\nWhen the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.\nWhat do you think the future of Xbox looks like?

In the early stages of the case, the Pornhub.com domain was 'virtually' at stake, but Pornhub's sister company was eventually awarded over $2.1 million in damages. The court denied injunctive relief, however, which means that there are no domain seizures or site-blocking orders. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
