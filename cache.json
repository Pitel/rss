          "description": "California dreaming.\n2D sports titles have had their place since Konami’s Track & Field rattled arcade screws loose with its fiercely competitive button rapping. WayForward’s Xtreme Sports draws influence from California Games, a summery seaside boardwalk of hip events and addictive tap-a-thons. You have two characters to choose from, dude or girlfriend dudette, who face off in various tricky sporting events that scream early '00s gnarlyness.\nXtreme Sports, originally a 2000 Game Boy Color title, was graphically impressive for Nintendo’s colour handheld, and the portrait and character art will be familiar to anyone ingratiated with WayForward’s pirate platformer, Shantae. The visuals are bold, colourful, and cleanly arranged, each minigame functioning well around a two-button control scheme. As well as a piecemeal practice mode, the story game features an island over-world with various NPCs who shape your bid for podium gold, and energy drinks that offer a competitive advantage. To enter the tournament proper where the challenge is increased, you first need to complete the training rounds. There are five events to tackle: skateboarding, in-line skating, street luge, surfing, and skyboarding.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We had around an hour or so to dig into Metal Gear Solid and its two sequels (as well as have a quick gander at all the bonus content on offer), which isn’t a huge amount of time for games of this scale, but we were able to get a broad idea of how the collection pans out. So, what’s the damage?\nWe started off with the OG, Metal Gear Solid. We were initially struck with the reality that this really is a warts-and-all kind of port, sticking to the original PS1 version’s low resolution and frame rate. We had a bit of a giddy retro thrill seeing it run as originally intended, but it does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity to not take things even further and provide a way to play these games that’s more in line with modern sensibilities.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Discontinued after less than a year on the market and never released in Europe, the elusive red-and-black headset is remembered as a headache-inducing, seemingly epic misfire from legendary Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi.\nNonetheless, a small but passionate community of engineers and developers is working to keep the Virtual Boy alive nearly three decades on from its premature and unfortunate demise.

Incredibly, while it feels like Amigo has become a staple in Sega's history — appearing in titles such as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (and its Transformed sequel) — the sombrero-donning monkey's debut game has never received a direct sequel, with Ver. 2000 launching in arcades and in Japan, and Samba de Amigo on Wii being an enhanced port.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.\nIndeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.\nRead more",

Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.\nDespite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.\nRead more",

This is probably because Firewatch isn't a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.\nI think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.\nDon't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.\n Read more",

          "description": "Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. \r\n\n\r\n“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.\r\n\n\r\nThe update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.\r\n \nRead more",

The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) \"lore\", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.\nIt's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?\nRead more",

A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.\r\n\nNow it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations.

HEY LOOK SPOILERS.\nI'm playing Edders Sheeran in Baldur's Gate 3, a bard with a Dark Urge to lash out and murder largely anything and everything. He doesn't know what causes it, and he doesn't know when the urge might strike. For a first playthrough, it's been a learning experience. Namely, I have learned that friends aren't safe, lest I puncture their guts with my bare fists in the middle of the night.\nI thought the urge would only bring downsides (what you'd normally get as a murderer), but I've also learned that it actually has benefits? You get capes in exchange for pulping people! I love capes! Here's to more of them.\nRead more",

Apologies - if you're up that neck of the woods and we happen to sight each other on opposing hillsides, I'll try to bellow something about Starfield.\r\n\n\r\nBefore I go, though, I wanted to check in about this whole \"news\" concept that's doing the rounds. The past two weeks have essentially been an exercise in tentatively pressing buttons and apologising to Katharine when half the website backend catches fire. I've tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday's musings about pacifism - but I've mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.\n  \nRead more",

It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I'm not gonna lie. I've had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I'd arrived fresh and green, I don't think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is. \nRead more",

          "description": "The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.\nIt seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets. \nRead more",

The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.\r\n\n\r\nOpus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018's Rocket Of Whispers and 2021's Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. \"They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,\" is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You gallop shrieking and blundering round a corner and are confronted by a series of ominous doors with labels such as \"Baldur's Gate 3\". You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you're commissioned to do a, haha, \"retrospective\" 10 years later.\nThis summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked \"Zelda\" and \"Final Fantasy 16\", then spent a frantic moment trying to force the \"Baldur's Gate 3\" door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I'm mixing my scenarios - it's the end of the day and I'm tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened. By far the grimmest and grandest of these is, of course, Diablo 4.\nRead more",

This follows equally knotty breakdowns of its zoning tools, which allow you to mix architectural styles, and its road traffic system, which will hopefully dispense with some of the pathfinding issues from the original Cities: Skylines. In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. \nStill. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.\nRead more",

Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it's over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.\nHammerwatch 2 is out today, and it's kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It's like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as \"adorable\", and it makes everything seem like it's a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don't want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn't quite right and there's some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.\nRead more",

Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.\nAnyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. \"Of course, we'd love to have you,\" I replied. What could possibly go wrong?\nRead more",

The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous.

Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you'll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.\nYou're also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you'll have to restart from one of the game's Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I'm hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game's many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.\nRead more",

          "description": "IO Interactive have found such success with Hitman over the past decade that it's hard to imagine the developer making anything else, but I have many vivid memories of its non-Agent-47-centric outings. 2010's Kane & Lynch 2 was a very special breed of spiritual ugliness, while 2003's Freedom Fighters wowed youngling me with its chunky urban squad tactics. I also have a soft spot for Mini Ninjas, one of IO's few jaunts into the realm of family-friendliness, if only because as somebody familiar with IO's other work, I could smell the blood beneath its bloodless Nickleodeon visuals.\nI'm keen to hear more of the studio's forthcoming James Bond adaptation, unveiled in 2020 - surely a marriage made in franchising heaven, though I struggle to imagine an IO protagonist quipping like 007. But I'm especially eager to lay eyes on its currently untitled Project Fantasy, an online RPG inspired by \"the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight\" of table-top gaming and more specifically, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy books.\nRead more",

Clearly inspired by the likes of Final Fantasy - albeit crossed with the ‘small animals on a big adventure’ feel of Brian Jacques' Redwall novels - it looked absolutely brilliant. That sentiment was only solidified by its Steam Next Fest demo last year, which left Katharine impressed by its compelling combat and rodent fantasy setting. It’s been quite the journey for the indie RPG, but we won’t have to wait much longer to see what Small Saga has to offer in full, as it finally has a release date. \r\n\n \nRead more",

A glimpse at the current Steam hardware survey reveals that the RTX 3060, RTX 2060, and GTX 1060 are all within the top four most-used GPUs – with the RTX 3060’s laptop version at number five. These are important cards, and messing up the next one would be a disaster.\nThe RTX 4060 is not a disaster. Ultimately, it a very capable 1080p graphics card, a technical upgrade on the RTX 3060, and (unlike several other RTX 40 series GPUs) arrives at a reasonable price. But it probably doesn’t deserve the apparent immortality of its predecessors, with only modest gen-on-gen performance gains and a heavy reliance on DLSS (including DLSS 3) to expand that difference.\nRead more",

Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”\r\n\n\r\nOne of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you're unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski's first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don't half move around in this industry.\nI never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski's follow-up remark that he'd like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.\nRead more",

(OK, so technically they're both on 97, but I'm guessing the \"score distillation\" arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur's Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian's new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&D adaptations ever set to code. It's also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur's Gate 3's success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you've likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today's \"triple-A games\", aka \"biggest/shiniest\". Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall \"quality\". A few people go into specifics: I've read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur's Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "While we continue to hope and wait for news of another Command & Conquered Remastered Collection, I'd recommend giving Tempest Rising a look to tide you over, especially now there's a free demo for it over on Steam. You don't have long to give it a pop - it will disappear on August 28th - but this base-building RTS harks back to the C&C days of yore with its diverse set of units and industrial metal soundtrack. I played a version of this demo earlier in the year and had a great time with it, so it's worth seeking out over the weekend if you get a spare moment. \nRead more",

The new game is the work of Grimlore Games, creator of Spellforce III and one of THQ Nordic's first internal development studios. It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios have semi-re-announced Outcast 2: A New Beginning as plain old Outcast: A New Beginning, having sensibly decided that positioning it as a sequel to a 24-year-old game might turn younger audiences away. In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.\nIn Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.\nRead more",

I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3's redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s.

          "description": "Overwatch 2 has launched on Steam and well, Activision Blizzard are probably regretting that right now. At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who've already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an \"Overwhelmingly Negative\" rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game's direction and faults.\r\n\n\r\nMany players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2's switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2's story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard's recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard's alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch's emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It seems like Fall Guys has been making the rounds lately. I mean, sure, the game has kind of been everywhere since it launched back in 2020. But its collaboration momentum certainly shows no signs of slowing down. So hot on the heels of Fall Guys coming to Final Fantasy XIV, we have official confirmation that the upcoming Super Bomberman R 2 will dip its hands into the Fall Guys pot as well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Xm66vWDNE\nThese two franchises have certainly enjoyed a good relationship up to this point. After all, Super Bomberman R Online had already crossed over with Fall Guys in 2021. What makes this one a bit interesting, though, is that Super Bomberman R 2 will have the… guy from Fall Guys shortly after launch. It’ll arrive on September 14, to be specific. Called the “Bean Bomber” here, you’ll be able to unlock the little fellow from the title’s in-game store.\nThe Bean will join a few other cameo characters that were previously pointed out by Destructoid’s own Zoey “corn chips are no place for a mighty warrior” Handley. These include the likes of Dracula and Princess Tomato, making Super Bomberman R 2 something of a crossover fest. Considering it’s hard to tell when and if we’ll ever see a lot of these classic Konami characters, I'll welcome these small cameos when I can.\nSuper Bomberman R 2 will launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 13. Those with physical copies can play the game a day earlier on September 12.\nThe post Super Bomberman R 2 will feature a Fall Guys crossover at launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was six at the time, but it was impossible to avoid the media fervor around its ultra-violence. My parents didn’t bat an eye when I rented it. My mother’s reaction to seeing me play it was to just ask if it was that game everyone was talking about. Then she continued with her day.\nThat would normally be an extremely weak way to start talking about Mortal Kombat 1. The original Mortal Kombat (which we can no longer refer to as Mortal Kombat 1) was 11 Mortal Kombats ago.\nYet Mortal Kombat 1 seems somewhat keen to tap into nostalgia for the ‘90s, and there’s nothing I have more abundance of than ‘90s nostalgia.

          "description": "We got word of a sequel to cyberpunk hack-and-slasher Ghostrunner back in May 2021, and now we have a date. 505 Games set Ghostrunner 2 up as another drop in a jam-packed bucket on October 26, 2023. \nAlong with the news came a new trailer for the first-person followup, which continues the story of Jack, a veritable cyber ninja who was thought to be one of the last active Ghostrunners. The new gamescom story trailer dips its toes into what's new this time around. This includes a quick look at the absurdly fast motorcyle and some of the vehicular combat that comes along with it. There's also a nasty AI cult to contend with, which doesn't sound too divorced from reality.\nGhostrunner 2 features a totally revamped progression system, with new abilities and paths available. According to 505, the sequel hopes to be more approachable to both new and experienced players alike. There's also a new block and perfect parry system, for those who pride themselves on their flashy CQC skills. It sounds like there's more freedom in the encounters and exploration, too, particularly when it comes to taking on bosses.  \n[caption id=\"attachment_397767\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot via 505 Games[/caption]\nRev 'em up\nThose looking to pick up Ghostrunner 2 when it launches can dig through a few pre-order options. The $39.99 Base Edition is both physical and digital, and the $49.99 Deluxe Edition and $69.99 Brutal Edition are digital. Picking up the Brutal Edition grants access to the sequel two days early on October 24. There's also a Season Pass with a new mode and four asset packs, a bonus animated skin and a motorcycle skin. If there's a way to make my motorcycle look as ridiculous as possible, count me in. \nGhostrunner 2 will dash to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC when it launches on October 26.\nThe post Ghostrunner 2 battles AI cults, ramps up vehicular combat on October 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced that the longtime voice actor of many iconic Mario characters is stepping back from the role. In a Tweet today, they made the announcement that Charles Martinet is instead moving into the role of “Mario Ambassador.”\nCharles Martinet has been in the role of Mario since 1994’s CD-ROM version of Mario Teaches Typing. Beyond the red-shirted plumber, he also went on to voice just about every other male character in the Mushroom Kingdom, including Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi. However, the recent Super Mario Bros. Movie cast Chris Pratt in the role, and trailers for Super Mario Wonder had many people questioning if Martinet had been replaced. That’s still kind of up in the air.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1693624002982314108?s=20\nThe post made by Nintendo doesn’t address the reasons for Martinet stepping back. However, it says that he will continue to travel to promote the character. They plan to follow up with a video featuring Charles Martinet and Shigeru Miyamoto, which will hopefully provide more information.\nIt’s a bit of a curious thing. Mario hasn’t been the most vocal character, so it shouldn't be that jarring to have another actor in the role. However, Martinet has been almost inseparable from the character for a long while now and had previously stated in 2021, “I want to voice Mario until I drop dead.” Really, I’m just hoping that agreeable circumstances led to him leaving the role.\nI also hope Nintendo isn’t planning on taking Mario games into a more dialogue-reliant direction, but that’s a personal preference.\nNintendo did not state if Martinet will still be playing his roles in upcoming games, such as the Super Mario RPG remake or Super Mario Bros. Wonder. More information is forthcoming.\nThe post Charles Martinet is stepping down as voice of Mario appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Resident Evil 4 received a remake in March 2023 which brought Leon’s classic adventure to modern consoles. As was the case with Resident Evil 7 and Village, Capcom has promised a VR mode for the remake. We’ll get to see a little more of the VR mode at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, which kicks off on September 21 and runs until September 24.\nResident Evil 4 isn’t the only Capcom game that’ll be making an appearance. The company also lists Street Fighter 6, Exoprimal, Monster Hunter Now, and the Ace Attorney trilogy on its official webpage outlining its Tokyo Game Show plans.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397688\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nCapcom has big plans for the Tokyo Game Show 2023\nCapcom will have its own booth at the Tokyo Game Show where attendees will have the chance to try out some of the company’s latest games. The event will also feature the return of the Resident Evil airsoft shooting range in collaboration with Tokyo Marui. For those who can’t make it, there’ll be a prerecorded stream which’ll share some of Capcom’s biggest news. It airs on September 21 at 07:00 AM PDT.\nWe received our first teaser for Resident Evil 4’s VR mode during the May PlayStation showcase, though not much was revealed. We'll hopefully see a few more details this time around, including whether game modes outside of the main campaign will also receive the VR treatment.\nThe company will have to put on a good show if it hopes to stand out, as several other gaming giants have confirmed that they’ll be showing up, including Bandai Namco and Square Enix. Sony will also be there, though they’ll only be exhibiting indie titles.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 VR mode scheduled to appear at Tokyo Game Show 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's easy to see the appeal, too, as the game's been described as \"Skyrim in space\" by Todd Howard himself. It's a given, of course, that not everyone will find themselves enjoying what appears to be a classic Bethesda Game Studios RPG, but some may have taken their biases a tad too far.\nIn fact, some early critique coming from a particular game developer has drawn the ire of Bethesda Game Studios' own Head of Publishing, Pete Hines.

It tells the tracks the tale of how Jann Mardenborough turned his love of Gran Turismo games into a fully-fledged motorsport career. Though the wide release for the USA is set for August 25, the film has aired in international markets, reception has been good thus far, and it has been reported that the film has already grossed $22.7 million.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395283\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Polyphony Digital.[/caption]\nGran Turismo racing to theatres\nThe Gran Turismo movie is a star-studded affair featuring Archie Madekwe as Mardenborough, Djimon Hounsou as Mardenborough’s father, and Orlando Bloom as Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore. As Blomkamp has explained, to capture the most cinematic shots, filmographers used FPV drones to carry IMAX sensor-approved cameras. Several cockpit shots were used which will be familiar to franchise fans.\nhttps://twitter.com/BORReport/status/1693278878792642768\nCritical reception to the Gran Turismo movie has been positive overall, which reviewers complimenting the film’s authenticity and sincerity. It has not managed to avoid all criticism, and there has been some controversy regarding the film's depiction of Mardenborough’s Nürburgring crash which led to the death of a spectator. Some have described it as insensitive, with Polygon calling it “a tasteless reframing of a fatal event.”\nGran Turismo’s road to theatres has featured a few obstacles. Most notably, it has had to contend with the SAG-AFTRA strike which has affected all of Hollywood. As a result, the movie had its August 11 release date delayed in the USA.\nThe Gran Turismo movie is but one of several video game adaptations Sony has in store. A Ghost of Tsushima movie is in the works, and fans can also look forward to television adaptations of the Horizon and God of War franchises.\nThe post Gran Turismo movie has grossed an estimated $22.7 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

The title takes inspiration from series like Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle, which has resonated with retro strategy-RPG fans. The Legends DLC was revealed during the 2023 Guerrilla Collective showcase, just shy of the game's one year anniversary. This update promises to deliver eight new chapters for the main story, 13 new unit classes, new characters, and additional game modes like the always-welcome New Game+.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397235\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Dancing Dragon Games[/caption]\nClass act\nSymphony of War moves beyond focusing on specific troops to building up larger squads of up to nine units, eventually giving players command of a full army. The main heroes come into play when it's time to lead those squads into the turn-based battles throughout the campaign. Familiar ground for strategy-RPG aficionados, no doubt.\nLegends DLC plans to expand upon this these mechanics with a new army meta that introduces necromancy and the undead. If raising an army of your own sounds like too much hassle, maybe literally raising them from the dead would be a more, um, palatable option?\nAs for the aforementioned new chapters, the eight added to the lineup are concurrent with the existing main story. They'll focus on expanding plots and tying up loose ends instead of starting anew with fresh faces and factions. \nWe'll get to see how it all expands for ourselves when Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga goes live with its Legends DLC on August 28, 2023.\nThe post Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga expands its pixel-art warfare with DLC this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

One of the first scenes has a pair of gun-toting dudes approach some sort of compound. They look out over the field, and there’s a bunch of watch towers that don’t have any textures. What’s funny is that the same watch tower model is shown later on in the trailer, but on that occasion, it has textures. There’s also compression all over the video that is so heavy that I had to double-check to make sure I didn’t have it set to 480p.\nThe game itself looks pretty rough. The graphics seem a couple of generations behind, which I don’t usually mind, but it’s not like the art style was adapted to make up for it. It just looks kind of gross. It could be good, it’s just this trailer certainly doesn’t make it look that way. They probably should have, uh… framed it better.\nThe Walking Dead: Destinies is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. There’s no release date, but they’re already saying it will be $49.99.\nThe post The Walking Dead: Destinies revealed with shambling, unfinished-looking trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gamescom 2023 will be kicking off next week, featuring some of the biggest names in the industry. One such name is AMD, and the PC hardware giant could announce some new lines in its RDNA 3 range.\nThat's if a recent tweet from AMD's own Scott Herkelman is anything to go by. Herkelman says that Team Red will be in attendance at this year's Gamescom, bringing with it the company's \"next major product announcements.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1691864001129443634\nWhat this will be exactly we can't say. However, judging from the \"s\" in \"announcements,\" it sounds like it's going to be more than one thing.\nNew graphics cards, surely?\nSuffice it to say, we would assume that AMD will announce its next line of graphics cards in its latest 7000 series. A report from PC Gamer speculates that it could well be the leaked RX 7800 XT.\nThat may not be all. Some people commenting under Herkelman's tweet are holding out that AMD will announce FSR 3. For those who don't know, FSR (or FidelityFX Super Resolution) is the tech giant's own take on algorithmic graphical upscaling, similar to Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's Xe Super Sampling.\nAMD seems to be trailing behind Nvidia at the moment. Its biggest rival has already released a number of products in its Ada Lovelace range. We've already seen the likes of the RTX 4090 right through to a 4060 from Team Green.\nConversely, there have pretty much only been two launches in AMD's RDNA 3 range: the RX 7900 (XT, XTX, and GRE variants) and the RX 7600. Now would the time for Team Red to start unveiling some more in order to keep up with Nvidia.\nThe post AMD could be announcing new RDNA 3 cards at this year’s Gamescom appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, players can download the game pre-release on its platforms, but it will be truly ready to play when September 6 (or September 1 for early access players) rolls around. Unfortunately, Steam users will have to wait longer for Starfield preloads to take effect.\nThose who own an Xbox Series X|S or a PC with the Xbox app can preload Starfield on August 17. Players on Steam have to wait much longer as preloading on that platform occurs on August 30. If you've bought the Premium Edition or Constellation Edition physically or digitally, you'll be able to gain access to Starfield five days early on September 1. To make the wait even more arduous, the Xbox Twitter page says its hand is moving \"closer to [the] giant LAUNCH button.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_397078\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via Bethesda[/caption]\nAfter delays, Starfield is actually ready\nStarfield was originally going to be released on November 11, 2022, but it was pushed back almost an entire year. “We know you’ve waited a long time to play something new from us,\" said director Todd Howard after announcing the September 6 release date in a trailer. \"Believe it or not, we’re kind of the same.\"\nHe later said, \"We really just can't wait for you all to play it.\" Now we're nearing that time. Many games from Bethesda's past were criticized for awkward facial animation and bugs across the board, but this new game engine may take Bethesda to the next level. It could lead to impressive showings for upcoming games like The Elder Scrolls VI. As of last year, that fantasy RPG is currently in a design stage of development.\nThe post Starfield preloads start soon for Xbox and Windows, later for Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

Please take a look. pic.twitter.com/U1ASicOuTO\nAugust 21, 2023\nMartinet has been the voice of Mario in the mainline games since Super Mario 64 in 1996. That’s more than 25  years as one of the most popular mascots of all time. Nintendo says it will share a special video message from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Martinet at a later date. \nThis news is out of left field, as it’s unclear why Martinet will no longer voice the character. Perhaps Nintendo wishes to take the voice in a different direction – it hired Chris Pratt to voice Mario in this year’s massively successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Perhaps Martinet simply wants to move on from the character, although that seems unlikely as he’s now in a new role of Mario Ambassador, according to Nintendo. \nRegardless of why, Martinet’s voice as Mario will be missed. Mario’s next outing, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, hits Switch this October but given today’s news, it’s now unclear if Martinet is the voice of Mario in that game. Game Informer has reached out to Nintendo to ask for confirmation on whether Martinet is the voice of Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder and will update the story if comment is received. \nWhat do you think of this news? Let us know in the comments below!",

After that, we have two interviews with folks who are involved with the music of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, but in very different ways. First up, we talk with Katie Chrzanowski, who you may know as the social media manager for the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. However, she's also the producer of the Sonic Symphony, which was livestreamed in 2021 and is heading up the world tour happening this fall. Then, Brian is joined by Tee Lopes, composer of Sonic Mania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.

          "description": "Like many people that near their eighteenth birthday, the Xbox 360 will soon lose support from its parent company. Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies & TV app will stop working altogether.\nHowever, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you'll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.\nAdditionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn't encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform's most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today's announcement post. Here's the most recent batch from November 2021:\nFor more Xbox 360 nostalgia, you can revisit our top 25 Xbox 360 games of all time.\nAre there any Xbox 360 games you'll be rushing to grab before the store closes?

          "description": "Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.\nIn a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn't cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”\nThis likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. \nAlan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. \nAlan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.",

He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...",

Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.\n\n\nDimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character. \nTo learn more about why we think TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is the best Turtles game in decades, read our review here.",

Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.\nCrimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. \nNext Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.\nhttps://t.co/AFycLZG9XF pic.twitter.com/mEj030uEQN\nAugust 16, 2023\nThe game's presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.\n\n\nCrimson Desert doesn't have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window.

          "description": "Star Wars is no stranger to video game adaptation. In fact, depending on your age, video games may be the primary way you interact with the far away galaxy from a long time ago. Outlaws, however, represent something new for the franchise, even if it isn’t new to video games. We’ve shot from the first-person perspective in Battlefront, explored labyrinthine, Metroid-inspired levels in Respawn’s Jedi games, and even commanded armies in Empire at War, but Outlaws is the first time we will explore an open Star Wars world.\nFollowing a panel on the game at Comic-Con, we spoke with Outlaws' narrative director, Navid Khavari, over e-mail about a number of topics related to the game, including potential overlap with Shadows of the Empire, what exactly protagonist Kay Vess is going after, the fate o…",

The event will shed more light on The Final Shape expansion and other upcoming events.\nThe event airs at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern with an hour-long pre-show prior and a live post-show roundtable discussion. The Final Shape is a significant expansion for fans as it’s billed as the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga.

          "description": "Assassin's Creed Mirage is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and after years of rumors and delays, its release date is still just out of reach. However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they're done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold and is coming out a week early! 📀\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/eWAZttvjIX\nAugust 14, 2023\nThe game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.\nIn an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it's a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur's Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with \"other RPGs,\" which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage's new date doesn't seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.\nHow do you feel about developers advancing their release dates? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.\nIn the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. \"Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.\"\n\n\nAccording to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The game was first announced in February 2021. \nEver Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.\n\n\nThis will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago.

In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.\nToday, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).\nHe has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.\nIn the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, \"I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.\"",

He’s set to take that head villain mantle once again in the third entry of the rebooted trilogy, and a trailer appropriately paints him as the boogeyman set to make Captain Price and Co.’s lives a living hell.

The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.\nDeveloper Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,\n“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”\nWhile it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. \nWrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.\nWresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.",

Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.\nBeginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password \"GETYOURMEW\" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.\nThe second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect \"something special.\"\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.\n\n\nDuring the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.",

The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.\n\"We have some exciting news about next year,\" one host says. \"This year's delays,\" the other host follows up. \"Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!\"\nThe Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. \nYou can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.\n\n\nDevolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.",

Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99.

During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.\nDescribed as \"a manaical poison aficionado,\" A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.\n\n\nWhile we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method. \nFor more on Street Fighter 6, check out our glowing review of the game, as well as our cover story.

In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect. \n\n\nStreet FFighter6 had a big showing at EVO this past weekend, as a new fighter A.K.I. was also announced. For more on Street Fighter 6, check out our review.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.\nThe lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  \nFans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. \n\n\n       \n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.",
