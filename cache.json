          "description": "Here comes the Sun.\nDespite the energetic title of this collection, the legendary Japanese development house Sunsoft never really went away. It's been steadily cranking out original titles, ports, and remasters on arcade and console since 1978, although it will likely never recapture the glory days of the 8- and 16-bit era. So prolific was its output that anyone who owned an NES or a SNES will have likely had multiple Sunsoft games in their collection. This Sunsoft is Back! bundle presents three titles released for the first time outside of Japan, beautifully emulated, and boasting a full English translation.\nFirst up is the fantastically titled Firework Thrower Kantaro's 53 Stations of the Tokaido. Playing as the titular explosive merchant, you must reach your fiancée in Edo, beset on all sides by a rival merchant's mercenary band. Kantaro’s adventure is a fun scrolling platformer of sorts, which has you dealing with tricky projectile-throwing arcs against enemies that bounce all over the place. Nailing a good shot against an approaching ninja is satisfying, but overall this one is a bit simplistic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Reader, we were not disappointed (thanks for the tip, d-slice).\nNow, when most of us solve an Addison puzzle in TOTK, it's a simple case of slapping a nearby boulder underneath the President Hudson sign or, at most, building a rudimentary frame for it.

Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest RPG has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you've been off heisting on Tatooine or getting all messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and watching for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.\n Read more",

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover.

Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest.

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production.

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a \"semi-open\" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. \"From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion,\" say the developers, \"always expect the unexpected.\" It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time. \nRead more",

My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small \"burst transmissions\" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.\nRead more",

Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.\nRead more",

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

The false and even defamatory accusations made by\r\nthe STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's\r\nemployees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully\r\nmobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access\r\nrelease of GreedFall 2.\r\n\nSpiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After\r\nunsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,\r\nthey have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.\r\n\nSpiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an\r\ninclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of\r\nwhich we can all be proud.\n\nThe email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.\nOriginal article continues below:\nRead more",

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

          "description": "I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.\nRead more",

I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous.

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.\n Read more",

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

          "description": "The shot meter has undergone a big change in NBA 2K25, but you can choose between different options.\n\n\nIt's been a long debate about whether you should use the meter or not. This year, the familiar meter from the older NBA 2K games has been removed. Instead, you get three options that are distinctly different from the older shapes. By default, you get the upward-moving arrow, but it's not my favorite, and it might not be yours as well. Thankfully, changing the appearance of the shot meter is extremely easy.\n\n\nNBA 2K25 changing shot meter guide\n\n\nThis year, you get to pick from the following options:\n\n\n\nArrow: A Small arrow moves upwards.\n\n\nRing: A Circular ring that diminishes as you attempt a throw.\n\n\nCircle: A circle that reduces in size and disappears.\n\n\n\nNo matter which game mode you play, the shot meter can be changed in all of them.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\n\nThe main game settings can be accessed from Features.\n\n\nIf you play MyTeam and MyCareer, you can change the shot meter from the settings within those respective modes.\n\n\nGo to Customize HUD.\n\n\nFrom there, select \"Shot Meter Shots.\"\n\n\nGo to the fourth option in this section - Graphic.\n\n\nFrom here, you can choose one of the three available options.\n\n\nYou can also change the color of the shot meter.\n\n\nThe size and placement can also be changed based on your preferences.\n\n\n\nThat's all you need to know about how to change the jump shot meter in NBA 2K25. While it's a good guide for beginners, you will want to turn it off eventually. When the meter is turned off, you'll get a bonus success rate on your green-timed throws, increasing their chances of going inside the basket. It could take you some to get used to, but the switch is definitely worth the effort.\n\n\nMake sure to make the changes individually across all game modes. Otherwise, they won't reflect during a game. \n\nThe post How to change shot meter in NBA 2K25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This time, there's just one mount to customize: the Delver's Dirigible. \n\n\nWhat's a dirigible? I think it's just an...old-timey flying machine? I mean, it sure looks like one. Here's how to get it.\n\n\nComplete Chapter 1 of the War Within Campaign\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to complete the entire first chapter of the campaign, which takes you through each of the expansion's zones, introducing you to new allies and races along the way. This is probably a given if you're, you know, playing the expansion. \n\n\nFinishing the campaign will lead you back to Dornogal, where you'll pick up chapter 2 after reaching Renown level 4 with each faction. \n\n\nBegin Chapter 2, and accept the 'Bountiful Delves' quest from Brann\n\n\nA few short steps into the campaign's second chapter, you'll be shown around to various stations in Dornogal that pertain to the endgame, such as item upgrade vendors and the Delver's headquarters. The quest Bountiful Delves appears as a purple exclamation mark above Brann during this step, and you'll need to accept (and complete) it for the mount. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThis quest requires you to get your hands on a Restored Coffer Key and complete a Bountiful Delve on any difficulty. You actually don't need to use the key in the Delve (which is helpful if you, like me, blew all yours during early access) to complete the quest, you only have to get your hands on one. \n\n\nWith those steps done, return to Brann and turn in your quest to get another one, which only has one step: receive your new mount.

If you're enjoying The War Within's new Delves (well, what's currently available, anyway), then you're also probably gunning for those Restored Coffer Keys, which give extra rewards at the end of their Bountiful variations. A word of warning, though: if you want to put them to good use, keep them in your back pocket a while longer.\n\n\nBountiful Delve rewards and you\n\n\nBountiful Delves reward a guaranteed piece of gear, assuming you've got a Restored Coffer Key to unlock their exclusive chest, of course. This piece of gear's item level and upgrade track will vary depending on the level of Delve you're tackling, with a hard cap at level 8 of item level 603. \n\n\nThis means you'll get the absolute best possible gear from any given Bountiful Delve at level 8. The problem? Those don't unlock until September 10, so if you're blowing your keys on the current highest level 3, you're doing yourself a disservice. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nIf a level 8 is a bit too salty for your taste, you can get \"Champion\" level gear (the highest upgrade track available in Delves) from level 7 as well. It'll just be two upgrade tiers lower, at an item level of 597.\n\n\nGetting Restored Coffer Keys\n\n\nNone of this matters if you don't have keys. I have a whole heaping guide up over here, but the long and short of it is this: You get four guaranteed keys a week from \"caches,\" those chests you get from weekly quests like Theatre Troupe, Spreading the Light, Special Assignment World Quests, etc. Beyond that, you'll need to get fragments from lucky World Quests or Worldsoul Memory Events. I'd say you can expect to get about five keys a week on average. Happy Delving!\n\nThe post A WoW: War Within reminder to save your Coffer Keys until next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Starting on September 12, Epic Games Store is giving players the opportunity to get Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland entirely for free. \n\n\nImage via The MIX Games\n\n\nThe Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland is a thoroughly enjoyable dive into epic nostalgia. Filled with collectables to find, interchangeable characters with special abilities, and levels that look like something directly out of the cartoons you grew up watching. \n\n\nIf you’re feeling even more nostalgic and want to truly take a trip down memory lane, you can always play in retro style by switching to 8-bit mode. I played the Adventures in Gameland demo in March and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything from the music to the voices brought back wave upon wave of nostalgia, so I highly recommend any '90s kid make the most of this freebie when it arrives.\n\n\nAlso, there’s multiplayer, which means you can wander around the Rugrats house (and beyond) with a friend, and really bring those memories of cartoons past to life. On top of that, it's coming to Epic Games Store as a freebie only two days after it's set to release! What’s not to love?\n\n\nImage via Konami\n\n\nIf you’re not ready to be overwhelmed by nostalgia, you could always go for the second game on offer that week — Super Crazy Rhythm Castle. You can play solo, or with up to three friends, making the approach to Rhythm Castle to try and take down King Ferdinand. \n\n\nThe game has over 30 tracks of all genres to play your way through, so there’s something for all tastes. Imagine Guitar Hero, but with cuter graphics and a story of overcoming adversity and puzzle solving on the side. It’s all about embracing chaos and, if there’s ever something I can get on board with, it’s chaotic fun.\n\nThe post Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland will be free on Epic Games Store from September 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Perfect Paradox, for example, has quickly returned to its place as a mainstay in most arsenals and a capable shotgun for both PvE and PvP content.\n\n\nOne such returning weapon takes on a rather new form of grenade launcher, but one that is surprisingly great for ad clear. Here's the god roll for the Martyr's Retribution grenade launcher in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Martyr's Retribution god roll in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nMartyr's Retribution sports the Wave Frame archetype, meaning it has one round in its clip and sends an energy wave out upon impact. This wave does quite a bit of damage but does cause the impact itself to be considerably weaker. Compared to some grenade launchers, this makes it far less suited for boss damage and more so for ad clear. The following perks and attachments help play into that role:\n\n\n\nLauncher Barrel: Quick Launch\n\n\nMagazine: High-Velocity Rounds\n\n\nPerk 1: Heal Clip\n\n\nPerk 2: Incandescent\n\n\n\nQuick Launch causes any shots from the Martyr's Retribution to come out fast while increasing handling speed. Easier use of the weapon is nothing to scoff at. High-Velocity Rounds further increases that projectile speed while also bringing in reload speed. Given we aren't running Auto-Loading Holster, that's quite helpful.\n\n\nHeal Clip is great for supporting yourself and your allies, especially since you'll be focusing on many lower-health enemies, reloading frequently, and getting plenty of kills to trigger it. Incandescent aids that goal, causing scorch to nearby targets and improving the area of effect damage.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Martyr’s Retribution god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In NBA 2K25's MyTeam mode, an evolution player is one one of the best ways to improve your team.\n\n\nUnlike standard cards, evolution items can improve over time. While there's a limit on how much they can grow, the improvements will dramatically change the look and feel of your cards. In fact, you can get up to five starter evolution players when beginning your MyTeam journey in Season 1. Let's take a look at how you can improve all five cards and take them all the way up from Emerald to Ruby.\n\n\nNBA 2K25 MyTeam evolution guide\n\n\nRecognizing an evolution card is pretty easy. They will usually have different designs as their background. Moreover, when you go to edit player and select these cards, there will be an added option to evolve them.\n\n\n\nTo evolve an evolution card, you'll need to satisfy certain conditions, which you can check by going through the card details.\n\n\nTo evolve the starter Emerald cards, just play a game with them (they don't need to be starters).\n\n\nOnce you have completed the condition, go to edit player.\n\n\nSelect the card.\n\n\nGo to evolutions and hold the X/A button till the meter fills up.\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThat's all you need to complete an evolution. Once the upgrade is complete, your superstar's card stats and design will change. If you have joined the party in early access, you can get a starting lineup of five 88-rated Ruby items for free of cost. Yes, it will take some time to evolve all of them, and no, there's no way to grow them together.\n\n\nCompleting the starter evolution agenda will also reward you with a Series 1 Deluxe pack. At the start of our journeys, every bit helps, and I was lucky enough to pull a 90-OVR Amethyst Joel Embiid from my free pack.\n\nThe post How to evolve a player in NBA 2K25 appeared first on Destructoid.",
