This was a seed that was planted by Shigeru Miyamoto way back in 2015, after all, and despite being drip-fed small updates over the ensuing seven years, we were beginning to think that perhaps the fourth mainline entry in the series had fallen onto the pile of cancelled Nintendo projects that would never see the light of day.\nWhen that September Direct happened, everything changed. We knew the game was real and that it would come to Switch in 2023. That was just about all of the information that we got at the time, but it was a start. A slow but steady stream of Pikmin 4 details followed, with release dates and trailers sprouting at random intervals as if to comfortably remind us all that the game is actually coming out this time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Even so, it’s hard to appreciate the challenges that healthcare workers face if you’re not one. Fall of Porcupine aims to do this in an approachable way by putting players in the scrubs of 2D animal doctors. Unfortunately, the latest release from Critical Rabbit isn’t the hard-hitting medical drama wrapped in a fuzzy waffle blanket that we would’ve liked. This cute game has so much potential, but it needed more care and a focused narrative to really soar.\nAn impressive amount of research and interviews have gone into the game’s much-needed commentary – everything from full beds to alternative medicine to corporate hospital management. It’s a shame all that research results in a flatline story with repetitive mechanics. You control Finley, an anthropomorphised pigeon and the newest doctor at St. Ursula's Hospital in the town of Porcupine. As you tend to patients, your boss, white cheetah Dr Krokowski, is constantly less than impressed with you. There’s also a fellow newbie doctor, a suspicious janitor, a chief physician, and MANY more characters who take the form of various animals.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "June has been a feverishly hectic month between the NotE3 season, big games relentlessly releasing back-to-back, and this infernal heat wave we’ve been stuck in. Amidst all the madness though, one indie has been able to blast through the noise to become a smash hit on Steam - only sitting behind CS:GO on the sales charts - and potentially one of this year’s biggest shooters. That impressive feat goes to BattleBit Remastered, a 254-player FPS that mixes Battlefield’s large-scale skirmishes, Roblox’s low-poly aesthetics, and some wild destructible environments. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over the weekend, DDoS attacks on Blizzard caused a bunch of issues for Diablo IV and other Battle.net games such as Overwatch 2. The cyber attacks prevented many players from logging into Diablo IV, and the hack-and-slashers that managed to log in were at risk of “high latency and disconnections” in the always-online RPG. That tragically forced many gamers to step outside during the hottest weekend in recent memory. Thankfully, Blizzard now states the DDoS attacks have ended, meaning everything should be working as normal. \r\n\n \nRead more",

No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. \nHere’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.\nRead more",

It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past.

So, I did the smart thing and roped in my pal Ed. Yes, my pal is also called Ed, so parts of this post sound like I'm referring to myself in the third-person. This isn't the case, but if you'd like to imagine that I, in fact, solved the puzzles myself, then please feel free to do so.\nRead more",

It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.\nDeep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.\nRead more",

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's no secret that I love Dorfromantik. It opened my eyes to the world of tile-based puzzler strategy games, and I've looked out for similar ones ever since. Thankfully for me, there's been a fair few riffs on Dorformantik's formula recently - a focus on nature, a soothing soundtrack, and some good old puzzling. Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you'll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.\nRead more",

But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.\r\n\n\r\nMy poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.\nDark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?\nRead more",

It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. \nOne excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters. \nRead more",

And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.\n“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one.

It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.\nRead more",

Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.\nThe tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.\nRead more",

What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.\nRead more",

We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.\nRead more",

          "description": "I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. \"It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors\" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.\nAnd yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.\nRead more",

The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. \nIt's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.\nWhat I'm saying is: it's still worth it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back on the shores of hell\nIn 2020, Nightdive Studios released a source port of the oft-forgotten Doom 64 that brought it to modern platforms and reintroduced it to a new, more receptive audience. Beyond simply porting it, however, they added a new episode that better links it to the rest of the Doom series narrative. Now fans have implemented the new episode back into the N64 version as Doom 64: Complete Edition.\nThis means that if you, for whatever reason (not judging), preferred the N64 version of Doom 64, you can play it again without sacrificing the extra features of Nightdive Studios’ source port. This all sounds really difficult, since the 2020 version runs on Nightdive’s proprietary Kex Engine. I’m assuming the maps still exist in an extractable format because I imagine it would be too much work to try to manually recreate them for a release such as this.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388694\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via MobyGames[/caption]\nBeyond simply adding the extra maps, Doom 64: Complete Edition adds a number of quality-of-life upgrades. You can find them at this link. One of the most important revisions for me, however, is the ability to disable three-point texture filtering. This was what was mostly to blame for everything on the N64 looking blurry. They also improved the framerate in some areas and enabled support for the Expansion Pak upgrade. That’s some good stuff!\nIf you haven’t played Doom 64, it’s definitely worth checking out. It always had its fans, but Nightdive’s port helped force a wider re-assessment of Midway’s contribution to the series. Personally, I don’t think it’s better than Doom, but I might put it above Doom 2. However, it has its own style and approach to the series’ formula.\nThe Doom 64: Complete Edition fan patch can be found here.\nThe post Doom 64 fan mod adds Nightdive’s new episode to N64 version appeared first on Destructoid.",

It turns out that skepticism was on point!\nAccording to WB, although the Arkham Trilogy will be sold physically, the cart only contains Batman: Arkham Asylum. Yep, only one of the games in the \"trilogy\" will be included physically, and you'll need to download the rest. Don't just take it from me, read the entire FAQ entry on the game's official site:\nDoes the Nintendo Switch physical version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy include all three games on one cartridge?\nBatman: Arkham Asylum will be included on the Batman: Arkham Trilogy game cartridge. Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight will require an online connection to download and install both titles when the Batman: Arkham Trilogy cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console. All three games will then be playable as long as the cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console.\n\nWelp!

          "description": "Possibly next-gen?\nWe're already painfully aware that Bethesda is taking its sweet time with The Elder Scrolls 6. However, there may be longer to wait still, as even the Head of Xbox Gaming, Phil Spencer, admits he doesn't even know what platform it's going to be on. There may be a few more years to go until the anticipated sequel ever sees the light of day.\nAnd exactly how long are we talking? Well, according to journalist Stephen Totilo, (reporting on the Microsoft/Activision court case), Spencer npted that Elder Scrolls 6 could be \"five-plus years away.\" If true, this would put the elusive Skyrim follow-up on track for a 2028 release at the earliest. As such, it could mean that the long-awaited Bethesda RPG is actually on deck for gaming's next generation.\nhttps://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1672314548995366935\nAccording to a recent report from The Verge, Spencer did say in a 2021 interview that it will be exclusive to Xbox, though it doesn't necessarily mean it will be this generation's Xbox. When questioned about this today, the executive doesn't recall ever making such a statement. And so, it stands, we're not really any closer to understanding what's happening with the next Elder Scrolls installment. A couple of years ago, Todd Howard said the game was still in early development.\nAll we can really hope is that once Starfield is released this September, then Bethesda will be willing to spill a few more beans. We can assume that, for now, the studio is just keeping its cards close to its chest.\nThe post The Elder Scrolls 6 could still be ‘five-plus’ years away appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wonder, Detective Pikachu Returns, and Mario RPG are at the top\nA little less than a week ago, Nintendo once again showed us the staying power of the Direct, and gave us a ton of announcements and a few surprise releases. We have a full recap here, but if you're a visual learner, Nintendo recently tweeted out a full infographic of what was announced or reconfirmed; with the first-party cream rising to the top.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388663\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nIf I had to guess what would win a \"most excited\" poll, it would be Mario RPG\nI'm still cautiously optimistic about Super Mario Bros. Wonder (I hope the gimmicks are more than skin-deep), but based on the almost universally-positive reaction to the Super Mario RPG revival, I'd say that takes the highest hype spot. I mean, it's at the top of my list too! Re-releasing Pikmin 1 and 2 was a genius move as well, as you can get the entire mainline Pikmin series on one platform now. That's kind of become a calling card for the Nintendo Switch: a successor to the 3DS in its own right, collecting both old, new, and new-again games in one spot.\nAs for Detective Pikachu Returns, it's in a super weird spot. We're years removed from the film, and I'm the only person I know who actually played the original Detective Pikachu from start to finish. It'll be interesting to see how the game performs, and if it gets another gigantic amiibo.\nThe post Here are all the recent Nintendo Direct games coming to Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Battle Beyond the Stars\nBethesda has confirmed that the \"Constellation Edition\" of its upcoming space opera Starfield will not contain an actual disc of the game itself, and will instead feature a download code for the chosen platform. The publisher noted this controversial development in a tweet from its support team.\n\"Hello!\" said the team, responding directly to a fan's question. \"All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs\". The tweet has since been deleted from Twitter.\nThe community understandably responded unhappily to the news, with some decrying the return of \"non-physical physical editions\", while others pointed to the continued slant toward a future where archiving games becomes a much-more-difficult venture without hard copies of the games themselves. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with some, (some as Twitter's Wario64), pointing out that certain adverts for Starfield's physical release had clearly stated that a disc was included.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYEiTdsyas\nThe removal of the initial tweet suggested that there were crossed wires somewhere along the chain of communication. And that indeed proved to be the case, as it now seems that while the standard edition of Starfield will feature a physical disc including game code, it is purely the $250 Constellation Edition that will not — a digital download code for the title being issued as part of this version. And so, anybody who wishes to pick up the Collector's Edition and own a physical disc of the sci-fi spectacle will, at this stage, be required to pick up both versions.\nStarfield launches September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X/S.\nThe post Starfield collector’s edition will not include an actual disc appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "But the Blessed Mother returned\nBlizzard Entertainment was hit with a huge DDOS attack this weekend, which ensured that several titles, including recent release Diablo 4, were offline and unplayable for an extended period of time. The DDOS attack has since passed, and the dungeon-crawling sequel is, as of this writing, fully playable once again.\nWhile players started noticing issues late Saturday, the attack was first noted by the studio itself on the morning of Sunday, when a brief message posted to Twitter said that the team was \"currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers\". Players had noticed that they were unable to log in to titles such as Diablo 4 and World of Warcraft during this time. The studio then confirmed that it was undergoing a DDOS attack, wherein parties intently overrun a server with requests, causing an information lockup or even a full collapse.\nhttps://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1673082677115666440?s=20\nLater that day, Blizzard announced that the attack had ended and that normal service had been resumed. The DDOS attack effectively lasted less than a day but, given that it was Sunday, it no doubt cut into some valuable playing time for those who are only able to delve into Blizzard's worlds during the weekend hours.

Even beyond that, if you pre-order Sonic Superstars, you’ll also get the ability to transform Robotnik into LEGO Eggman. Leggman!\nThat’s about it. Uh, here’s a trailer.\nhttps://youtu.be/qi8zAunO9xw\nThat was fun! As you can see, it does everything I told you. Sonic the Hedgehog is replaced by the LEGO minifig of the classic ‘90s veteran. I’m not sure how accurate this is to what the DLC will be like, but I’m hoping that Robotnik will always appear like that if you use the skin.\nIt’s really classy for Sega to announce both DLC and pre-order bonuses right together. Classic Sega. This seems like not a lot for DLC. Will we see LEGO minifigs of the other characters? I’m guessing no, but you never know.\nSonic Superstars is, of course, the upcoming classic-styled sidescroller with four-player co-op. I’m looking forward to it, but I keep getting flashbacks to the co-op in the Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. It was so awful to whoever was stuck as Tails. When my husband and I were first dating, he was really excited to find out that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has co-op. I tried to check his expectations, but even then, he was extremely disappointed when we finally sat down to play it. It’s only slightly better than handing your sibling an unplugged controller so they can pretend to play along.\nSonic Superstars is going to be released sometime later this year for PS4/PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

Take the recent changes to revenue splits. Some felt that this was a step in the right direction, but given that the new program comes with a bunch of boxes that need to be ticked, not everyone can benefit.\nNow, there's a new feature that's being implemented, which could also be seen in a less-than-good light for most. According to a recent blog post, Twitch is introducing \"Hype Chat,\" a feature that gives viewers the chance to literally buy chat messages. The idea behind it is to let users \"stand out\" in the overall chat.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388337\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"572\"] Image via Twitch.[/caption]\nAmounts that can be paid for messages vary from $1 to $500 (though Twitch says that streamers can set a minimum amount up to $100). Depending on how much a viewer pays will depend on the duration of the pinned comment, as well as character length, and the visual design. All this while affording the person streaming the ability to \"earn a share of the revenue from each Hype Chat purchase.\"\nBut, as usual, not everyone will get the benefit of this new feature. The blog post goes on to say that Hype Chat is only available to Partners, so smaller channels will miss out. However, the Amazon-owned service does say that it may look into implementing this \"more broadly\" in the future.\nFor some, though, it may be too little too late to win back support. With big streaming names like xQc and Amouranth already jumping ship to rival platform Kick, things are looking a bit tough for Twitch right now, though it should be noted that it is still pulling in millions of users each month.\nThe post Twitch introduces ‘Hype Chat,’ where you can pay money to pin your messages appeared first on Destructoid.",

Based on an audio series by French author John Lang, this adaptation has players guide a party of hapless heroes through a series of quests, winning the day because of, rather than in spite of, their clumsy nature.\nIf you're a fan of tactical role-playing action, or fantasy dungeon crawlers, and want to check out a fun twist on a familiar favorite, then be sure to bag yourself The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos when it becomes free to download between June 29 - July 6. Before then, you still have the opportunity to pick up current freebie, immersive grim sim theHunter: Call of the Wild.\nThe post Dungeon of Naheulbuk is the next Epic Games Store freebie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not a big buffet, but it does feature New Game Plus, which I’m surprised it took this long to be added.\nOn top of New Game Plus, Sonic Frontiers is getting some goofy cosmetics, a special collectible Koco, new moves, and some new challenges. That’s all pretty groovy, but I don’t know what else to really say about them.\nhttps://youtu.be/vAB_BG60APA\nNew Game Plus, I can certainly understand the value of. Sonic builds up his skills throughout the game. This will allow you to start over with all of those intact and just completely wreck house with a combination of too much power and experience. Both your skill tree and power-ups will carry over.\nI should probably go back and finish Sonic Frontiers. I played it pre-release and fell off at maybe the 10-hour mark. I was covering it for guides, and everything in that game has its own dedicated tutorial. I also feel like, while I like Sonic the Hedgehog games (some of them), I have to be in a very specific mood to play them, and I’m kind of feeling that right now.\nThe Birthday Bash update is completely free to anyone who owns Sonic Frontiers, and is dropping today at 5:00 pm PST.

Reddick voiced Sylens in both the core game and its expansion, Burning Shores. This is as well as appearing in 2017’s Horizon: Zero Dawn.\nThe memorial for Reddick can be found within the Burning Shores expansion on the island where you first meet Seyka. If you start off on the area to the North of that island using a campfire on the beach (near the lava flow), you can fly directly south, across the straight, and onto a ridge. You might find it easiest to spot at night because the memorial itself is a bright blue hologram.\nhttps://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1672213285712584704?s=20\nBeyond memorable roles in film, such as Charon in the John Wick series, Reddick has been a voice in video games since 2009’s 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand. He had a prominent role in the Destiny series. After news of his death, Destiny 2 players gathered to pay respect.\nThe memorial is part of the latest update for Horizon: Forbidden West, and demonstrates how well-respected Lance Reddick was among those he worked with.\nHorizon: Forbidden West and its Burning Shores expansion is available on PlayStation 5.\nThe post Memorial to Lance Reddick added to Horizon: Burning Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "'80s titles planned for rerelease on Switch and PC\nOld-school cool developer Sunsoft has announced that it is planning a crowdfunding campaign in hopes to bring three of its Japan-only Famicom releases to modern platforms. The campaign will officially launch on the Japanese crowdfunding site Campfire between July 14 - August 31.\nThe three titles up for rerelease are Edo-set platformer Kanshaku Tamanage Kantarou no Toukaidou Gojuusan-tsugi (1986), side-scrolling fantasy adventure The Wing of Madoola (1986), and finally the casually-paced text adventure Ripple Island (1988). None of the titles ventured outside of Japan and thus have since faded into obscurity, a status that Sunsoft is hoping to revitalize.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388355\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image from Shmuplations[/caption]\nShould the Campfire campaign prove successful, the three titles will be ported to PC and Nintendo Switch. In addition, the publisher is hoping to release physical gold cartridges of the games for the Famicom platform. Way back when, Sunsoft was one of the few companies allowed to release its titles on specially branded cartridges, (see image above), and while many of the studio's games were awarded this prestige, gold-tinted cartridges were a goal never achieved by the studio. Hopefully, Sunsoft will be able to realize its glittery dream, if 40 years after the fact.\nLocalizations for the titles were not confirmed, and seem unlikely, but we will let you know should this change.\nSunsoft plans crowdfunding campaign to port three Famicom titles to Switch, PC [Gematsu]\nThe post Sunsoft to crowdfund ports of three forgotten Famicom releases appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Depends on your definition of \"fishing\"\nIf you were hoping to be able to whip out your rod and catch some alien fish in Starfield, there's bad news on that front. Todd Howard himself has confirmed that fishing won't be a feature in Bethesda's upcoming RPG.\nIn the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Xcast, Howard is asked a bunch of questions regarding the game. About 14 minutes in, he's asked whether there's going to be any \"space fishing\" in Starfield. Howard begins his answer by saying that it \"depends on your definition of 'fishing',\" curious as to whether it refers to the collecting or killing of fish.\nhttps://youtu.be/AIbnDyv6g1c?t=880\nCo-host Gary then gets more specific by asking whether he'll be able to have \"some kind of rod\" that can be put into a lake in order to retrieve a fish. Howard then crushes Gary's (and probably other people's) hopes by confirming that the game does not have that feature. However, this does open up the possibility of it being including in an update, expansion, or even something modders could implement.\nAs we know, Skyrim was given a fishing feature for the Anniversary Edition that dropped in November 2021. Given this, it's not too far-fetched to consider that Bethesda may add this peaceful hobby to Starfield at some point in the future. But that's just speculation on our part.\nWhen it comes to open world games, players like to take a step back from the action for a bit. The chance to do a spot of fishing while exploring an alien world sounds appealing, so it's a bit of a shame that Starfield won't have it on release.\nThe post No, Starfield will not have space fishing appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Hines, Bethesda initially made a deal with IP owners Walt Disney to develop an Indiana Jones game for multiple platforms, but this was changed following Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda, mirroring the circumstances surrounding the recently released (and maligned) Redfall.\nhttps://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1671939745293688832?s=20\nAs we have reported on many an occasion, The FTC's lawsuit against Microsoft has been filed in order to argue against the latter's proposed $67 billion purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard. This long-running and increasingly cumbersome deal has had to climb over many hurdles and walls on its way to fruition, with the FTC lawsuit set to prove one of its largest obstacles. While preliminary hearings are underway, the case will go to U.S. courts in August, though both parties will have the right to appeal regardless of the result.\nWe can very likely expect to hear more behind-the-curtain tidbits before the summer is through.\nThe as-yet-unnamed Indiana Jones title is currently in development for Xbox and PC at MachineGames.\nThe post Indiana Jones will be an Xbox/PC exclusive following Bethesda acquisition appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, with so many titles now including the mode, the amount of available maps has skyrocketed.\nHere are 10 of them that remain the best the series has offered to date.\n[caption id=\"attachment_387446\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\n10.

The two cars featured are the \"1956 Barbie Movie Corvette EV\", (featured in the Chevrolet section), and the \"2022 Barbie Movie Hummer EV Pickup\", (featured under GMC). Videos of the vehicles in Showcase Mode were later uploaded by another Forza devotee, Aziial.\nNo dates for the drop have been announced, so it is assumed the two *electric vehicles will arrive as free downloads or in-game rewards to cross-promote the movie itself, which premieres July 21.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN7qCE4uI_s\nDirected by Greta Gerwig, Barbie follows the adventures of the titular doll, as she and her long-time pal Ken (Ryan Gosling) leave Barbieland to visit the \"real world\" and get a taste of reality. A huge ensemble cast includes Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Michael Cera, America Ferrara, Issa Rae, and Helen Mirren. Response to recent trailers has been extremely positive, and all that's left is the waiting game before we find out with the talent both in front of and behind the lens can live up to the hype.\nForza Horizon 5 is available now on PC and Xbox platforms. Barbie premieres in U.S. theaters July 21.\nThe post Barbie’s curvy Corvette is coming to Forza Horizon 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing.

This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear,&nbsp;among other wacky effects.&nbsp;The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a trip, and it launches on October 20.</p>",

Today’s Nintendo Direct brought us a closer look at the game while highlighting the project's appearance on Switch consoles.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">In the game, the group from Persona 5 is pulled into a new world, where they join forces with a new character named Erina, who is fighting as a revolutionary against the prevailing power in that place.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Gameplay allows for both up-close and ranged attacks over the course of its turn-based tactics encounters, but you can also use Personas to get your point across. Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Drawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Persona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lDRDLAAmyc\" width=\"\"></iframe>",

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
