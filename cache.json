To make matters even wilder, it was a pseudo-edgy re-imagining of decades of Disney iconography with forgotten mascot Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as a central antagonist.\nAnd yet Epic Mickey happened, and what’s perhaps even more unbelievable, given the complications of re-releasing licensed games, is that 14 years on we’d be getting a remade version of the game. But, following the remake of the certified banger Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, Purple Lamp is taking the helm of an updated edition of Mickey Mouse’s Wii adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.\nThe square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it \"punk rock\" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like \"there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom\". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?\n Read more",

Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen.

Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors.

Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.\nRead more",

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.\nAll that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other \"content creators\" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of \"trigger words\" like \"Covid-19\", no talk of \"politics\" or \"feminist propaganda\", and no mention of \"China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc\". \n Read more",

It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as \"a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game\". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update. \n Read more",

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC.

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.\nAh, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.\n Read more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.\n \nRead more",

Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author.

          "description": "Embarking on your Minecraft upgrade journey begins with the creation of an enchanting table setup, a pivotal step that opens the door to the best tools. While acquiring low to mid-range gear is straightforward, reaching the highest tier necessitates a specific building arrangement. We're here to explain how many bookshelves you need for the Level 30 enchantment in Minecraft.\n\n\nHow many bookshelves do you use for level 30 enchantments in Minecraft?\n\n\nYou can unlock Level 30 enhancements in Minecraft by placing 15 bookshelves within a one-block radius of the table. The build must also be on a two-block level, as any shelves placed on the third level will not count towards it. To give you an example, the setup on the left won't work (bookshelves are on the third block), but the one on the right checks out:\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThe bookshelves basically have to be as close to the enchanting table as possible. Nevertheless, you can still place them one block away to give you room. If you need some ideas on how to build it, you can check out our guide on the best enchanting table setups.\n\n\nAlthough the build helps set the stage for the enhancement, you'll still need to take a few more steps to get better materials. The maximum tier requires three lapis lazuli and a Level 30 experience rank. Go deep into the mines to acquire the lapis lazuli, which can also help you gain XP for your levels.\n\n\nTo earn more XP in Minecraft, look for Monster Spawners in the mines and defeat hordes of enemies. It'll take some time to reach the higher ranks, so keep mining and fighting to farm a ton of experience points.\n\n\nOnce you've tackled the requirements, place your desired tool in the enchanting table. You'll gain unique buffs like the highly durable Unbreaking III or the damaging Smite V. However, enchantments are completely randomized, so it all depends on the luck of the draw.\n\nThe post Minecraft: How many bookshelves are needed for level 30 enchantments? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Users reported from the moment the game was available to play that it ran seamlessly. \n\n\nNow, three weeks into the life of the game, Fields of Mistria has achieved Steam Deck verification, so if you’ve been holding back on taking Mistria and its residents on the move with you due to lack of official backing, you’ve no longer got any excuses. \n\n\n\n\nThanks to this move, Fields of Mistria joins other cozy staples like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Stardew Valley, and Unpacking, which you can all take on the move with you.

          "description": "The deadly Backstab Kills have appeared in many objectives, including Weekly Challenges and weapon unlocks. But, since the elimination doesn't have a description, it can be confusing to understand. If you want to know what to do, we'll explain what Melee Backstab Kills are in Modern Warfare 3. \n\n\nMW3 Melee Backstab Kills, explained\n\n\nMelee Backstab Kills are eliminations that must be performed behind an enemy Operator using a Melee-based weapon. Regular guns won't work with this tactic; therefore, you must use tools like Karambit, Gutter Knife, or Sledgehammer.\n\n\nPerforming the Melee Backstab Kills without the proper preparations will be challenging. To help you through this, use Tactical Equipment such as Stun and Smoke Grenades. Cast out this equipment in battle and try to sneak up behind the enemy while they're in a vulnerable state.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo be extra sly, utilize Covert Sneakers or Dead Silence to remove an Operator's footstep sounds. This will make it easier for you to sneak up on the enemy without being detected. You can also equip Ghost T/V Camo to get you off UAVs, Heartbeat Sensors, and enemy radar sources. Without these items, you'll be pretty easy to spot, as running can get the attention of enemy Operators.\n\n\nUse small maps to earn the Melee Backstab Kills in Modern Warfare 3 quickly. I like going into Shipment for this since everyone tends to get caught in the chaos from its compact size. Then, when the opponent is preoccupied with someone else, you can sneak your way in for the elimination.\n\n\nCompleting this task earns you various rewards, depending on the season. For example, Season 5 Reloaded's Spear requires players to get three Melee Backstab or Special Zombie Kills. It also comes up a lot in Weekly Challenges, so keep it in mind for future references. And, if you're confused about any more Call of Duty terms, be sure to check out our guides on Clean and Gun-Butt Kills.  \n\nThe post What are Melee Backstab Kills in Modern Warfare 3? appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're also continuing to see the rise of expansions for some of the most famous games out there, from World of Warcraft: The War Within to Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. \n\n\nWith all that said, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of game releases as the months go on, especially if you're partway through a playthrough and learn that more games are launching the same week.

It’s coming to Steam Early Access in 2025.\n\n\nThis is also revealing to me how little I know about how the Heroes of Might and Magic games play.

          "description": "Do you remember when Snow Bros. Wonderland was announced, a new 3D entry in Toaplan’s Snow Bros. arcade series? It was really unexpected. Well, it has a release date now. Clear River Games says it’s coming November 28, 2024 to PS4, PS5, and Switch. No PC? Curiouser.\n\n\nPart of what makes this really unusual is that Snow Bros. isn’t the best-remembered arcade game you could make a latter-day sequel to. I have a slight fondness for it owed partially to encounters with it in my youth, but even I wasn’t asking for a new one. There was a remake/remaster of the first game released in 2022, which kind of affirmed that it’s fine. It’s okay. It isn’t Bubble Bobble, but it isn’t a complete waste of your quarters in the arcade, either.\n\n\n\n\nSnow Bros. Wonderland doesn’t even seem all that related to the arcade games. You play as either Nick or Tom and the main combat mechanic is rolling up snowballs, so that’s not nothing, but it’s a lot less arcade and more PS1. There’s a lot of very familiar-looking collecting and platforming.\n\n\nThat’s not to say it’s definitely going to be terrible. It’s in the margin of murkiness where the antiquated graphics and gameplay could belie some enjoyable gameplay. I do enjoy those early 3D platformers. It’s just such a strange sequel. There were a lot of casualties that came from trying to shift 2D formulas to 3D, and this looks so evocative of that era. If you told me this is a remaster of a canceled N64 game, I’d wander off to do my research.\n\n\nYeah, I’m curious. Whether or not I have time to get around to it in November remains to be seen. In the meantime, we're still waiting on the Snow Bros. 2 remaster.\n\n\nSnow Bros. Wonderland will arrive on PS4, PS5, and Switch on November 28, 2024.\n\nThe post That really bizarre new Snow Bros. sequel has a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

One task you'll encounter during seasons like the Dapper Delights Star Path is giving gifts and chatting with a stargazing wayfinder. However, knowing exactly who this is requires a bit of movie knowledge.\n\n\nWho is the stargazing wayfinder in Disney Dreamlight Valley?\n\n\nIf you want to chat or give gifts to a stargazing Wayfinder, look no further than Moana. In the Disney universe, Moana is a Wayfinder who follows the stars as a compass when navigating her ship, which is where this nickname comes from.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDepending on the Star Path and tasks you find, you may have to give Moana some gifts, strike up a conversation, or hang out with her. Most character-related objectives take around two real-world days to complete, so be sure to keep an eye on your tasks and how many items, chats, or minutes you need.\n\n\nOne example you might encounter during events like Dapper Delights is giving Moana or a \"stargazing wayfinder\" four gifts. Since you can only give three favorite gifts daily, you'll need another day for the last gift before completing the task. Similarly, you can only have one daily conversation, so expect to hop back in another day if an objective requires several.\n\n\nOnce you complete the task, you can redeem your Star Path points through the events menu. You can use them from here to claim prizes on the rewards screen. The exact points you receive will depend on the Star Path, but it's usually between 20-30.\n\nThe post How to find a stargazing wayfinder in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Palworld has teamed up with Twitch as part of the Summer of Rewards event, offering three brand new Pal Skins for players on Steam. They’re bizarrely adorable cosmetics, and they’re relatively easy to get, but only as long as you play through Steam. \n\n\nThis is proving to be something of a sticking point for players who play Palworld on Xbox, and honestly, I can see why. I wouldn’t have known that these drops were exclusive to Steam players from Palworld’s social media posts alone, as it’s not explicitly stated anywhere. I only figured it out for myself when I was asked to link my Twitch and Steam accounts through the Palworld website. \n\n\n\n\nComments on social media are filled with Xbox players noting the unfairness of the whole situation, and I can’t say I blame them. Many players are missing out on unique Pal Skins because they play on the \"wrong\" platform. These are the first Pal Skins to drop outside of the single existing one, Cattiva Sunglasses, which was added as part of the Sakurajima update, and they're not available to everybody.\n\n\nPalworld isn’t the only game giving items away in the Summer of Rewards event. Many other games give in-game items in return for watching streamers play. However, as far as I can tell, Palworld is the only one limiting their drops in this fashion. \n\n\nCult of the Lamb, which is also part of the Summer of Rewards, is also giving exclusive items to Steam players, but there’s a huge difference: The items are only exclusive to the single platform for now. The Goat-themed items are being given to Steam players as a sort of Early Access and will be coming to players on all other platforms at a later date. \n\n\nThere have been no such reassurances from Pocketpair that players on any platform other than Steam can get the Pal Skins, and therein lies the problem. Here's hoping that Pal Skins, or any other potential future Twitch drops, are more inclusive of players.\n\nThe post Palworld: Xbox players are feeling left out by Steam-exclusive Twitch drops appeared first on Destructoid.",
