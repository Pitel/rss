Wow, so basic.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet are on their way, presumably adding another hundred-or-so critters to our 'Dex, and we can't lie — some of them are already winding their way into our hearts. There's Fidough, the purebread dog that everyone loves, Smoliv and Lechonk, the little guys with meme names, and Pawmi, Gen IX's Pikachu stand-in, not to mention the cute starters of Quaxly, Sprigatito, and Fuecoco.\nBut, ahead of Scarlet and Violet tearing up our list of favourite Pokémon, we thought we might take the time to decide who holds the top spot in our hearts — and what that says about us as people, players, and trainers.

Both are one-on-one fighting games, and they retain the series hallmark of obtaining enemy skills for tactical use. Controlling either Mega Man, Proto Man or Bass (and Duo for the sequel) imagine Mega Man minus the stage-long preamble, and that’s about the size of things.\nBoth games very recently appeared as plug-in entries in the recent Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium for $4 a piece. While that nominal price tag and the assumption that the arcade games are superior might put some off of this new collection, Mega Man Battle & Fighters, but there are still valid reasons to pick it up.

The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that'll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. \nToday Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope.

          "description": "Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as \"The Laughing Deer Show\". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we'd like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.\nIn fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question \"what games would you play for the first time again?\" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory?

The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.\nFor me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.\nRead more",

          "description": "Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life.

Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.\nIt's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.\nRead more",

Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve's Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below. \nRead more",

          "description": "For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that's because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I've enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sorry, loot box fans\nOverwatch's third Anniversary Remix event is finally here, and it will be the last that we know of — unless it rolls over into the sequel. The seasonal event has been a fan favorite, not just because you can get some cool limited-time skins, emotes, and voice lines in Overwatch loot boxes, but also because you can replay other limited-time game modes from the other seasonal events.\nWhile it's exciting that the Anniversary Remix is back yet again, Blizzard announced some not-as-exciting news along with it: players will no longer be able to buy loot boxes after the end of the event. To be clear, you'll be able to purchase loot boxes up from now until August 30 as part of the Anniversary. However, this just applies to the purchase of loot boxes — you can still earn standard loot boxes in gameplay after the event is over.\n[caption id=\"attachment_338843\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Genjiman Genji in Anniversary Remix Vol. 3.\n[/caption]\nAs would be expected, more changes are coming after Overwatch 2 launches, namely that loot boxes will be done with altogether because the game will be replacing its predecessor.\nBecause Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play, it will be adopting the seasonal model, which will include both free and paid battle passes. In addition, players will be able to purchase individual cosmetic items as well, in case there's just that one skin you can't live without. It took me a few years to get the Witch Mercy skin back in the day, so I wish this had been an option a few years ago, to be honest.\nWhile this feels like the end of an era, it's probably for the best.

          "description": "Get your very own Skyrim foe\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can be modded to the moon and back with new magic, models, and systems. But a new Skyrim mod adds the Nemesis system, for a little extra Shadow of Mordor in your Elder Scrolls.\nCreated by modder Syclonix, the \"Shadow of Skyrim\" mod adds a new Nemesis-style system to Skyrim. It essentially adds a new player death mechanic, making it so dying in Skyrim adds a bit more narrative flavor and mechanics.\nWhen an enemy takes the player down, they gain a unique name, stats, and more. For example, they might become a shield-breaking vampire. Toggles can allow the enemy to also loot your stuff and use it against you, donning armor the player had been wearing.\nNot only does this give you a new objective and quest, but it can turn into a boon, too. The player might gain a certain debuff upon dying, but be able to remove that and replace it with a new buff in its place once besting their rival.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_56Ouy8II\nRivals of Skyrim\nWhile the mod takes inspiration from the Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War games, the modder emphasizes that it's not drawing on specific Mordor gameplay ideas. The concept might have arisen from having a named Nemesis, but its systems are notably different.\nAnd while the important distinctions are one thing, I also like the twists Syclonix puts on this rival system. The flavor text is fun, and I like the idea of gaining rewards and having to recover your armor, almost in a Tarkov-style manner. It's also designed to work with a number of other The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim mods. For full compatibility info, you'll need to check out the mod page.\nYou can find the Shadow of Skyrim mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on NexusMods here.\nThe post Skyrim modder adds a Nemesis-style system to the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Now get to Slashin'\nInput lag — even in 2022, it continues to be a frustrating thorn in the sides of online fighting game players. And, ironically, while the ninth generation of gaming is well underway, it appears that Sony's shiny new PlayStation 5 platform tends to exacerbate the issue, rather than repair it.\nCase in point: Arc System Works' Guilty Gear Strive, which currently suffers from an estimated 4.5 frames of input lag on PS5 when compared to its sibling PS4, which only suffers from around 2.5 frames. Input lag is an inevitability in almost all fighting games, but the lower a developer can get the fateful number, the better it is for all players.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GYL5FVpjG4\nTo that end, ArcSys has released Version 1.21 on both PlayStation and PC platforms, bringing with it a few small bug fixes, optimized controls for the Figure Mode and much requested improvements to the server connection time on startup. Specifically for PS5, however, the input includes reoptimized input lag. This should bring the PS5 edition more in line with its PS4 and PC brethren, although ArcSys is tight-lipped on exactly how much faster your chosen fighter will respond to your instructions.\nCourtesy of Kimagre Gaming, here are some post-patch results for all platforms.\nhttps://twitter.com/kimagreGaming/status/1556955540001267712?s=20&t=jIt6z9pG9PRXOEUaWIyCYQ\nGuilty Gear Strive is preparing to launch its second season, bringing with it new characters, new stages, a new competitive season, and further updates. The wonderful Bridget is already available today, with more content coming to the title over the coming year. Guilty Gear Strive has already smashed the one million sales mark, and hopefully, this popularity will continue across the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.\nThe post Guilty Gear Strive update 1.21 improves PS5 input lag appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Back to the links?\nClap Hanz, the indie outfit behind the beloved Everybody's Golf franchise, has registered two new golf-related trademarks, suggesting that the Yokohama-based studio might be preparing to return to the green in the near future.\nAs spotted by ResetEra users, (and later reported by VGC), the trademarks Easy Come, Easy Golf and いつでもGOLF, (which roughly translates to \"Golf Anytime\"), were registered together, which suggests that they are localized names for the exact same project. Whether this represents an all-new golfing franchise or is merely a rebranding for the previously released Apple Arcade game Clap Hanz Golf is unknown.\nEverybody's Golf launched on PlayStation in 1997 to immediate success, presenting quality golf gameplay with accessible controls, tight mechanics, and a generally cheerful and charming comedic aesthetic. This original release would be followed by over 10 sequels and spin-offs on various PlayStation and mobile platforms. The last iteration launched on PSVR in 2019. Given the closure of PlayStation Studios — as well as an overall disinterest in supporting third-party projects — the chance of the series returning anytime soon is incredibly unlikely.\nThe franchise is definitely missed by its dedicated playerbase. Given golf's intricate technicalities, titles such as the Clap Hanz series — as well as franchises such as Mario Golf and Golf Story — are often very successful, stripping back the simulation efforts and replacing them with colorful and charismatic visuals. Hopefully, Clap Hanz will reveal its plans for the new trademarks very soon.\nEverybody’s Golf studio has registered trademarks for a potential new golf game [VGC]\nThe post Everybody’s Golf dev registers new trademark ‘Easy Come, Easy Golf’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's the original synopsis:\n\"In Pac-Man World, Pac-Man arrives home on his birthday to find the Ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's family & friends and ruined his party! Pac-Man must set out to adventure through the six areas of Ghost Island to rescue his family and friends, and face-off against the Ghosts’ boss, Toc-Man!\"\n\nAs you can see when comparing them directly, the original is a bit longer, showing off more of the Ghost Island locale after Pac-Man actually sees the invite (it's a whole minute and a half of extra footage). Maybe that bit will be slotted into a later cutscene, but either way, it gets the point across with a completely new tone, and respects our time a bit more (if you're not into long PSX cutscenes).\nPac-Man World intro remastered:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSng9vAnXbs\nPac-Man World intro original:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwLnlWACzzs\nEven better than an intro, Bandai Namco has also given us a graphical showdown of sorts with regular gameplay.

          "description": "Because sure, why not\nIt looks like Pac-Man could be hitting the silver screen. A new report claims a film is in development, based on Pac-Man, and it's live-action.\nThe Hollywood Reporter says the project is in the works between Bandai Namco Entertainment and Wayfarer Studios. It's apparently based on an original idea from Chuck Williams of Lightbeam Entertainment, a producer on 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog.\nWayfarer was founded by Justin Baldoni and Steve Sarowitz, and was behind Disney+ feature Clouds. No further details have been reported on what direction this live-action adaptation of the arcade classic might take.\nBandai Namco, meanwhile, has seen a number of video game adaptations come and go. They've ranged from varying Tekken films to series and anime adaptations. Tekken itself is getting another iteration on Netflix later this month, with Tekken: Bloodline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6-donCAnCc\nPuck Man to the rescue\nConsidering there isn't too much narrative fodder to work with, I have to wonder where exactly a Pac-Man movie goes. Maybe a comedy that imagines the Pac-Man world and its everyday action as a standard 9-to-5 world, like Wreck-It Ralph.\nOr maybe it goes a darker, grim route, imagining Pac-Man as some grizzled ghost hunter. What if the \"games\" are put on by a higher power, and Pac-Man is in some kind of Squid Games situation, fighting to survive in a maze full of ghosts and dots?\nHonestly, I have no clue. But since video game adaptations have shown absolutely no sign of slowing down in the near future, I'm down for whatever. Resident Evil has had multiple adaptations in the last few years, Castlevania keeps tearing it up on Netflix, and League of Legends struck gold with Arcane. If Mario and Sonic, are both returning to the silver screen, then Pac-Man should get a shot too.\nThe post A live-action Pac-Man movie is reportedly in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players will have to band together to fight off killer enemies from outer space.\nIt has a big retro-future vibe, in the same vein as Deathloop and the upcoming Rollerdrome. It's also got some notable industry names attached to its developer, Embark Studios.\nEmbark is headed up by former DICE CEO Patrick Söderlund, so it could have some similar ideas. And honestly, a co-op PvE game with a mix of outer-space and tinge of Battlefield sounds pretty alright to me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKASgkxK1g\nWe haven't seen too much of ARC Raiders yet though, aside from what was shown at last year's Game Awards. It's third-person, and seems to have a pretty hefty amount of gunfire and explosions, as well as some fearsome and massive robots to take down. It's some borderline Earth Defense Force vibes, which I'll be honest, I'm here for! Big robots versus small soldiers sounds like a good time.\nWe'll see how the project comes together as Embark continues to work on it and show off more.

That's in two days!\nSomehow, Nintendo plans on spending \"roughly 30 minutes\" on the game, which is on the longer side for these sorts of micro/single game Directs. Even the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct was about 24 minutes, so they're clearly aiming high here. There are precedents though. Back in 2015 (!) Nintendo essentially had to sell people on a brand new franchise, and spent 33 minutes explaining the universe of the first game. Then a few years later for the sequel, that Direct was nearly 27 minutes long.\nEither way, there's a lot we can still glean from another Direct, like:\nStory (Return of the Mammalians)/lore info\nCampaign structure\nMore multiplayer maps/weapons\nSalmon Run (co-op) info\nSecrets/extras like amiibo support\nThe last part is what I'm rooting for, and serves as perfect Direct material. That sort of mysterious tease is what gets all the speculation going once the video is done, and Nintendo is generally pretty good at it! Plus, I hope there's some form of amiibo support (even minor): as it stands, there's no mention of amiibo on the game's various regional store pages, which could be confirmation or an oversight.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1556626244644503553\nThe post Nintendo continues its smaller Direct strategy with Splatoon 3 on August 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. \nSega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it's fun to listen to Fullerton's takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. \n\n\nYou can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” \nArc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we'll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.\nThe official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine's Day and the second arriving in April. \nRunning faster, flying higher, and punching harder. #SonicMovie3 hits theatres on December 20, 2024. pic.twitter.com/DcFGbaKUao\nAugust 9, 2022\nThe tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. \nDecember 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen.

We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. \nThe new level is called \"Bean Hill Zone\" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a \"Bean Hill Zone\" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.\nThose aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.\nThis isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.\nFall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.",

A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it.

The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period.

          "description": "When Nintendo first introduced the Switch Online classic games catalog featuring NES games, I bemoaned the announcement of what I saw as an inferior content delivery system. Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.\nThen in 2020, something changed.

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",

My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.\nMMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. \nI’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. \nIf you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.\nHere are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: \nMonster Hunter World: 18.3 million \nResident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million\nMonster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million\nResident Evil 2: 9.8 million\nMonster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million \nResident Evil 5: 8.3 million\nResident Evil 6: 8.3 million\nStreet Fighter V: 6.6 million\nResident Evil Village: 6.4 million\nStreet Fighter II: 6.3 million\nAs you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. \nNow that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March. \n[Source: MyNintendoNews]\nAre you surprised by this list? Let us know in the comments below!",

It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. \nSince the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: \nGet ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!\nhttps://t.co/kbnwKv1n5m pic.twitter.com/NoVvqUzSTp\nAugust 4, 2022\nAs you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II.

          "description": "Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle & Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. \nThe game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. \n\n\nDespite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.",

From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games' debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that's left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ's first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick & Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  \nWe want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)\nAugust 4, 2022\nTweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:\nSeason 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you'll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James' butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, \"I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I've come away impressed with what I've played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on MultiVersus so far? Let us know in the comments below!",

Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.\nSPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.\nAnyone who has played…",

If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.\nThe finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.\nFinally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. \nSince the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.",

Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.\nThe hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.\nAmazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. \nThrough the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from.

After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. \nAEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW's in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts. \nFirst off, here’s what the box art looks like:\nTHQ plans to share more gameplay details during a TH…",

While hardware sales of the base Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite have surpassed 111 million units sold, sales are down nearly 23% overall. \nMore specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch's sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch.

While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.\nWe still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word \"authenticity\" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:\nEasier Play\nMore Pro for the Pro Stick\nHang on the Rim\nShooting is a Weapon\nKilling Stalls with Adrenaline \nDefensive Play\nImproved A.I.\nBadges Sound More Confusing But Better?\nPurchase",

          "description": "Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a \"AAA game studio\" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. \nNow, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. \nHere's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp\nJuly 30, 2022\nOne more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.\n@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx\nJuly 30, 2022\nAs you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. \nThe reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, \"I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine\" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. \nWhat do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!",
