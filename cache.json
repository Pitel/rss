          "description": "\"Collaboration contents from outside Capcom will not be carried over\".\nThe Nintendo 3DS had plenty of incredible exclusives and in its heyday, a lot of those were in the Monster Hunter series. One gem that truly stands out from its no-glasses-3D siblings is Monster Hunter Stories. Developed as a collaboration between Capcom and Marvelous, this turn-based RPG was quite a massive departure in comparison to anything that's come before and is highly regarded by those that did play it. However, Stories was overlooked by many at the time as it was dealt the unfortunate hand of launching six months after the console that would replace the 2DS and 3DS, the Nintendo Switch.\nFlash forward to the year 2024, and not only has a Switch sequel to Stories released, but that first game that fans loved so much is finally making its way to Switch, too. We had the chance to send off a few questions to the Monster Hunter Stories team at Capcom and the game's producer, Yoshihiro Akira, was kind enough to give us his insight on the game's co-development with Marvelous, 3DS-exclusive features, and what it's like bringing this game to a new audience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The sun may be slowly setting on Switch, but quality revisits such as Metroid Prime Remastered, Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario: TTYD hardly feel like stop-gaps. Even less exciting games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD represent hearty late-gen fare, especially for players who never played the originals.\nStill, if you are a returning player, you might be looking at the price tag for these games and raising an eyebrow.

          "description": "I'm sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur's Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.\nThe hole came up during a discussion of whether Larian have considered testing any smaller, more focussed videogame concepts, perhaps to let younger developers try their wits on something less sprawling than a Baldur’s Gate. “Oh, you mean within Larian in terms of incubation? But there's always stuff happening that you never see,” Vincke began. “I think people still underestimate how much work these big RPGs are already, and how many components there are in there - you never see a lot of small things that are being done, but there's a lot of innovation happening, other things that never see the daylight.”\n“You see small groups, and juniors in those small groups, you know, they'll bring the things that they care about,” Adam added. “You can see, I think, in Baldur’s Gate 3 that there a lot of scripters who are immersive sim fans, and who are bringing ideas from elsewhere. The world is sandboxy, and within that they are playing with their favourite genres. I get to play with horror, you know, one of my favourite genres, in the storytelling. An RPG of that scale, you’re kind of making lots of things all at the same time. So there's definitely the space to do that.”\n Read more",

          "description": "A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. \nRead more",

Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of \"free\" and \"vegan\" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands.

Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out.

But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer.

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.\nAnd what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.\nRead more",

You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.\nRead more",

          "description": "Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It's great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.\nRead more",

          "description": "I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase \"by Ernest Cline\" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.\nRead more",

          "description": "There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter. It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed.

Na to se podíváme na Virtuální Bastlírně!\r\n\r\nTentokrát se strahováci podívají na zoubek velmi slibně vypadajícímu open-source EDM projektu - ne, nejde o taneční hudbu, ale o elektroobrábění. Ukáží taky, jak vypadá starší cykloradar zevnitř nebo jak se testuje odolnost iPhonů.\r\n\r\nKdyž už se mluví o hardwaru, je tu nová soutěž od Hackaday, ve které jde o nápady, které se vejdou do velikosti klasické vizitky. Ukáží i pár levných blbinek z Číny včetně bezdrátové tiskárny nebo antén pro blízké pole.\r\n\r\nZe softwarových témat stojí za zmínku nová ROM pro československý počítač Ondra nebo jak aktuálně probíhá hackování nedávno vydaného multitasking MS-DOSu.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 4. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "There's good news for XDefiant fans who are sick to death of being destroyed by enemies using sniper rifles, as executive director Mark Rubin has confirmed a significant nerf is on the way. \n\n\nThe discourse around sniper rifles has rumbled on since release day, with fans claiming that weapon class has been ruining the game. Specifically, the fact that the rifles didn't feature any flinch when being shot by an opponent caused huge frustration, as enemies were able to aim perfectly even when they were getting slammed with bullets. \n\n\nThankfully, that's about to change, as confirmed by Rubin himself in a tweet on June 1. Responding to a tweet that asked if snipers would ever be balanced, the XDefiant executive producer stated that the class was \"a bit buggy right now,\" asking fans to let them fix the sniper and then re-evaluate. \n\n\n\n\nAs for how they intend to fix them, Rubin wrote: \"Right now we are adding flinch so if you are taking hits you can't just turn, point, click, and delete people. Should be in an upcoming patch.\"\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Rubin didn't specify when these tweaks would arrive, although it's possible that we may have to wait until Season 1 begins to see such a significant change. Still, it will definitely be a welcome adjustment, with fans replying that it's \"good it's coming\" and \"exactly what [they] were hoping for.\"\n\n\nI for one echo those comments, as I'm sick of getting sniped from a guy who has eaten three of my SMG bullets and somehow still got perfect aim. With this change, it feels like XDefiant's weapon classes will feel more balanced and have their own unique advantages, something that the game has been crying out for. \n\nThe post XDefiant’s overpowered sniper rifles are finally getting nerfed appeared first on Destructoid.",

There is, of course, a lot of Shadow of the Erdtree in here, which makes sense. The DLC is imminent, and Elden Ring's premiere was at Keighley's Game Awards broadcast, so it should have a big showing here. \n\n\nThere are other, similarily big games featured, too, hinting we may see more over the next week. The trailer features glimpses of the upcoming Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero and what looks to be the next Batman game, the Meta-exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow. \n\n\nSummer Game Fest will air live on various platforms, including YouTube and Twitch, on Friday, June 7, at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT. The show will be a live production with trailers, reveals, and news of the biggest games from a plethora of devs. \n\n\nIn addition to the main SGF show, there are a number of highly anticipated ancillary programs over the surrounding days, including Devolver Direct and the much-hyped Xbox Games Showcase + Call of Duty Direct. \n\n\nThere will also be some kind of Nintendo Direct soon, though details remain scarce.

          "description": "A leak from a reasonably reliable source seems to hint that the Rabbids, Rayman's iconic lagomorphic foils, could soon appear as a joinable faction in XDefiant. Where's the limbless wonder when you need him?\n\n\nThe leak comes to us courtesy of AgainTx, a data miner who has provided credible information about weapons, abilities, and features that made their way into XDefiant after the game's initial launch. According to AgainTx, the Rabbids are just one of several new factions that will debut in XDefiant's second year. Many of these factions are based on Ubisoft games that have not yet received any representation in XDefiant, including Assassins Creed, Rainbow Six, and The Crew.\n\n\nUnfortunately, many of AgainTx's posts regarding this potential leak have been taken down to do copywrite strikes made against them by Ubisoft. While this means I can't technically back up AgainTx's claims, the fact that Ubisoft is going out of its way to censor their content does lend an air of credibility to them and their work.\n\n\nIf this leak turns out to be accurate, I'm amazed it's taken this long for the Rabbids to appear in XDefiant. The Rabbids have come a long way since their debut in Rayman: Raving Rabbids back on the Wii, to the point where they've effectively become the unofficial Ubisoft mascots. While I'm not afraid to admit that I feel the Rabbids' whole \"so-random\" schtick is a little played out, I'd be lying If I said I'm not excited by the sheer madness they could introduce into the straight-laced world of a first-person shooter like XDefiant.\n\n\nOf course, this is still all speculation, and there is a real possibility that AgainTx will be proven wrong once XDefiant's second year starts. Only time will tell, but it seems like this leak could be a fun, or at least funny, one if it turns out to be true.\n\nThe post XDefiant may be getting a wild new faction appeared first on Destructoid.",

These components included leaderboards, match stats, a co-op vs AI mode, and a Smash Bros-like free-for-all mode that added random items. \n\n\nAlso missing was the ability to play as an unowned character in training mode. Without this option, players are left with no means of test-driving a new character without unlocking them.\n\n\nIn their place was a brand new season pass with unlockables and a new single-player driven \"Rift\" mode.

The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.\nAs the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. \nKena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+\n\n\nWe awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, \"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.\" The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021. \nYou can learn more about Kena: Bridge of Spirits by checking out our behind-the-scenes features in our cover story hub.",

That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it's been more than two years since its reveal. \nHowever, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. \n\"People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don't know why,\" Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. \"I think it's because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping.\" \nHere's a clip of it, too: \n😭 pic.twitter.com/CPoIy0zrOh\nJune 3, 2024\nNow, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the \"but you guys can keep hoping\" part at the end, but it's more likely that he's trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. \nIn the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series' future with Final Fantasy, and more. \nDo you think we'll hear about Kingdom Hearts IV this upcoming weekend?

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.",

In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.\nThat playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.\nA lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.\nWe’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.",

Unlike the last entry, Astro's Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. \nThe trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro's Playroom can be found here.",

Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation.

Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal?

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far?

The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.\nThe patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. \n\n\nHomelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review of the game here.",

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.\nYou can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.\n\n\nHive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.",

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.\nWhat follows is something close…",

          "description": "In 2009, a video game called Canabalt was published on the iOS App Store. It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.\nNow working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.\nWhen the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent.

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.
