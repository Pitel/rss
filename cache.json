          "description": "Paper, un-jammed.\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the standard for Mario RPGs for 20 years. It, alongside its N64 predecessor, captured what fans wanted from their turn-based, plumber-starring adventures – silly humour, epic adventures, fantastic combat, and charm. Purists often view the GameCube original as the end of the 'true' Paper Mario style – a little bit unfair, perhaps, when Super Paper Mario and The Origami King are both great, if undeniably different from that original formula.\nIt should be no surprise that the Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door was celebrated upon its announcement. Even if you like other Paper Mario titles, it’s hard to argue that Thousand-Year Door wasn't a high point for the plumber, not just in the RPG space but in Mario’s wider canon. Two decades later, that still holds true, and now the best Mario RPG is finally more accessible.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A light bite.\nCapcom is one of the titans of the gaming industry, and among its most successful and powerful franchises is Monster Hunter. Yet it’s easy to forget that, for many years, the series was exclusive to one platform holder – first Sony systems and then a spell with Nintendo starting with Monster Hunter Tri on Wii. On top of repeated exclusivity, it took a while to establish much of a footing outside of Japan, and even then it was still impenetrable and inaccessible for a lot of gamers. Too difficult, demanding, time-consuming, or downright unintuitive — outside of a dedicated base of fans (this scribe included), it was largely ignored.\nGradually, oh so gradually, Capcom decided to make the series more accessible. The mainline games began to add more mobility and gameplay styles in the Nintendo era, nowhere near as open to a wide audience as Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, but on the way to reaching more players. The 3DS entries in particular started that push but still eventually beat up hunters that dared to reach the endgame; then Monster Hunter Stories arrived on Nintendo’s little system and offered an alternative, a gentle hug as an introduction to the series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries.

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming.

And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.\nRead more",

If so, you'll probably love the smell of Valheim's Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.\nRead more",

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch \"later this month\", say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's \"distinct style\". \nRead more",

Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an \"official cinematic world premiere trailer\" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.\nAlso, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.\nRead more",

Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.",

In fact, developer Arrowhead Game Studios can't confirm when its next patch will arrive, with community manager Thomas 'Twinbeard' Petersson saying the team wants to \"take some more time for this one.\"\n\n\nWhen asked on Discord (as highlighted on Reddit) when players can expect the next patch, Twinbeard only answered with \"When it's done,\" adding that future patches may potentially come out less frequently. He explained that the team has felt it's been putting out patches too often, which risks making it difficult to \"maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve.\"\n\n\n\n\nTwinbeard's not exactly wrong. Helldivers 2 has seen a near-constant stream of patches since its February launch to address bugs and glitches as well as add new content to the game. As an ongoing live-service, this regularity does seem like it can only be a good thing, but some feel that Helldivers 2 has been growing and updating too quickly, and pushing out so much so often is affecting the quality of the updates.\n\n\nTwinbeard also explained how patching a lot can \"easily disrupt work flow and takes more resources than you might think.\" This is why the studio is opting to slow things down a bit and stretch the next patch out, \"hopefully with a good result.\"\n\n\nPlayers would need to adjust not having patches drop at least once a week, but it may be beneficial for Helldivers 2 in the long run, and allow for more meaningful updates and content additions. It's strange, though, that what seems like a pretty significant notice for players has been delegated to the Discord channel. There's no mention of this on the official Twitter account or Steam page, with it falling to fans to spread the word around.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2 patches may slow down as Arrowhead plans to take its time with the next one appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some of those from the latter group are more dedicated than others, and hardly anyone will beat DeityVengy, a YouTuber and Starfield modding enthusiast who employed over one hundred mods to turn Starfield into the closest we can get to a video game adaptation of the Mandalorian TV series.\n\n\nOn top of character skins, blasters, mobile empire units, Jetpacks, and revamped Star Wars-based menus, the most amazing part is that everything works beautifully well together. It really does look like you're in one of the highest-budget episodes of the series.\n\n\n\n\nEven though DeityVengy is constantly trying to improve the experience and will probably never stop adding new mods as he finds them, they say the mods below constitute the core of this Mandalorian experience.\n\n\n\nMandalorian Suit\n\n\nStar Wars Aliens\n\n\nUC Empire\n\n\nFreestar Rebels\n\n\nShadow Collective - Crimson Fleet Conversion\n\n\nStar Wars Purge Troopers\n\n\nHugin's Ecliptic Bounty Hunters\n\n\nStar Wars Weapon Replacer (ALL)\n\n\nStar Wars Aurebesh Conversion\n\n\nStarfield HD Overhaul\n\n\nBoostpack to Jetpack\n\n\nUnified Camera\n\n\nSlightly Better Weapon Icons\n\n\n\nWhether you love or don't care for Bethesda's games, it's hard to deny that they still push the envelope when it comes to fan creations — even when the company seems to accidentally thwart all modding efforts in other games. \n\n\nIf none of this floats your spaceship, you can play normal Starfield on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and watch The Mandalorian on Disney +.\n\nThe post Starfield player creates their own Mandalorian experience with over 100 mods appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you want to go all out with this amazing shotgun, check out what we have cooking below.\n\n\nBest Kuva Sobek build in Warframe\n\n\nThis is going to be a very end-game-friendly build that’s great for general use. It has a stronger emphasis on mobbing thanks to the Acid Shells mod. So, here’s the setup:\n\n\n\nGalvanized Hell\n\n\nGalvanized Savvy\n\n\nPrimed Ravage\n\n\nToxic Barrage\n\n\nFrigid Blast\n\n\nAcid Shells\n\n\nCritical Deceleration\n\n\nHunter Munitions\n\n\n\nExilus: Vigilante Supplies\n\n\nArcane: Primary Merciless, Primary Deadhead, or Shotgun Vendetta\n\n\nProgenitor Element: Fire\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWith this build, you’re going to be doing heavy critical hits with heat and viral damage often. It’s great against armor and health. Also, once you start getting kills with this, nearby enemies will be inflicted with Corrosive, giving you bonus damage with the Galvanized Savvy mod. \n\n\nPair all that with Hunter Munitions and now you have something that chews through health and armor with ease. Bonus points if you use Warframes that have grouping abilities like Nidus with his Larva. \n\n\nIt’s important that your Progenitor element is fire so that you get to just put in the Viral elemental combination in any order. Just as long as you have cold and toxin together, you can get that combination. \n\n\nAlso, there’s wiggle room with the Arcane Enhancements since this weapon is quite versatile. The projectile spread on this gun is very tight, making it a prime candidate for headshots. However, if you aren’t too good at hitting enemy heads, just opt for the Shotgun Vendetta or Primary Merciless options. \n\n\nTo get the Fire element on the shotgun, these are the frames that give the element upon starting the Lich process:\n\n\n\nChroma\n\n\nEmber\n\n\nInaros\n\n\nKullervo\n\n\nNezha\n\n\nProtea\n\n\nVauban\n\n\nWisp\n\n\nThe post Best Kuva Sobek build in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Manifold Bond is a mod in Warframe introduced in the Abyss of Dagath update. This mod, along with others in this update, all provide some kind of benefit to your Sentinel or Hound companions. Here’s what you need to know about this, and how to get it.\n\n\nHow to get Manifold Bond in Warframe\n\n\nTo get the Manifold Bond mod in Warframe, you have to purchase it from Master Teasonai in Cetus. You have to be Rank 3 with the Ostron Syndicate and buy it from him for 20,000 Standing.\n\n\nJust grind out bounties in the Plains of Eidolon through Konzu while minding possible caps in your profile or with the Syndicate so you won’t waste any along the way.\n\n\nWhat does Manifold Bond do?\n\n\nManifold Bond is a conditional mod that if an enemy is tagged with three or more status effects and is killed, your Companion’s ability cooldowns are reduced by three seconds. This is only when it’s maxed out.\n\n\nSo, your companion has to deal three status effects for this to take effect. It does not matter once they are killed, but the procs have to be there. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIs Manifold Bond worth it?\n\n\nOn paper, this mod seems really strong. But in a practical sense, Manifold Bond is not really worth it on a robotic companion build. With the current meta of Warframe, you’re going to have to kill things pretty fast. By the time three status effects are inflicted, it’s most likely from you or your teammate. \n\n\nSince companions attack indiscriminately and at their own pace, it’s hard to get this to proc often for the mod to really shine. This would only really be practical on something like a Moa that can use Whiplash Mine or Stasis Field. It can technically work on Bhaira or Dorma Hounds that utilize Null Audit or Repo Audit.\n\n\nTry it out, but sentinels and companions that attack will potentially draw more aggro, getting downed more often in the process.\n\nThe post How to get Manifold Bond in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

Knowing how the passing of Time works in Hades 2 is key in your struggle against Chronos.\n\n\nTime in Hades 2 gives you a good idea of how long certain in-game activities can take, but it doesn't pass by any traditional means. In Hades 2, time moves via a unit of measurement called \"While,\" which moves in several ways.\n\n\nWhile, and how the passing of Time works in Hades 2\n\n\nThat passing time, or While, is shown as a small clock symbol next to a number in Hades 2.

We've put together a WoW MoP Remix Goat Farming Guide to show you exactly how you can farm the bleating beasts for some quick experience, Bronze, and event-specific rewards.\n\n\nImage via Blizzard\n\n\nWoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria Goat Farming Guide\n\n\nThe best way to farm Bronze, experience, Lesser Charms, Scrolls, and other items exclusive to the WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria event is to farm Goats in the Valley of the Four Winds. As long as you have a full group clearing out the plateau of Goats, they will quickly respawn allowing you to mass farm the Goats in this area for a ton of rewards. Here is the best method and guide on how to successfully do the Goat Farm in WoW Remix: MoP:\n\n\n\nLog in to a Level 37+ WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria specific character. (Level 70 is recommended)\n\n\nHead to the plateau just west of The Heartland in Valley of the Four Winds.\n\n\nCheck Group Finder for a group labeled 'Goat Farm' or start your own.\n\n\nOnce in a group, fly up and down the plateau killing the groups of Goats as they spawn in.\n\n\nLoot them using AoE Loot to get all the Bronze, Scrolls, and Lesser Charms.\n\n\nRepeat! This is better in a group because it will constantly clear out the plateau quicker, forcing faster respawns.\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhere to farm Goats in WoW Remix: MoP\n\n\nThankfully, it's easy to get to the right place to farm Goats in WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria. Simply head down to Valley of the Four Winds, then look for the big raised elevation plateau on the map in the western part of the zone. The plateau is just to the west of The Heartland, as you can see circled in red in the map above.\n\n\nUp and down the entire plateau is where the Goats will continually spawn, so just fly up and down it farming the groups of Goats as they spawn!\n\nThe post WoW MoP Remix Goat Farming Guide (WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. \nAfter roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. \nCheck it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: \n\n\nMultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. \nFor more, read Game Informer's MultiVersus review after its first launch back in 2022, and then check out Joker's MultiVersus gameplay and his Batman Who Laughs alternate costume. \nAre you jumping back into MultiVersus next week when it launches?

Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. \n\"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene,\" the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. \n\n\nAs for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur's Gate series in general. \nOver on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. \n\"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw,\" the blog post reads. \"Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that's why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture.\" \nFor more, read Game Informer's Baldur's Gate 3 review, and then find out why it's on Game Informer's list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now. \nWhat kind of RPG do you hope Larian Studios makes next?

Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.\nAs reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. \nThe tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, \"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. \nFNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule. \nWhat do you think this new iteration will be?

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new \"narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.\" The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. \nThis studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.\nThis dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless.

The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. \nThe story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nSimilar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices.

Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. \nOriginally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. \n\n\nAt 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. \nOn the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year. \nFor more about PlayStation, read about how Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino have been named dual CEOs of the company, and then read Game Informer's Stellar Blade review.

Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers. \nMidsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.\n\n\nThe company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” \n“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”\nMidsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.",

It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. \nDeveloper Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. \n\n\nArrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. \nAs announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!\n@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…\nMay 14, 2024\nNotably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about how PlayStation recently walked back its Helldivers 2 PlayStation Network changes. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you one of the 12 million Helldivers 2 players?
