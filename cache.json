Not that it will get dirty forever.” I’m not sure I’ve ever felt the crushing weight of universal entropic decay so keenly as in that RPG maker textbox, nested upon Felvidek’s nicotine-stain hues. I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.\n \nRead more",

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.\nRead more",

Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown.

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.\nRead more",

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment's open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.\r\n \nRead more",

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door.

It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, \"yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run.\" So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!\n Read more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.\nRead more",

It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Call of Duty Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op would be a blast from the past for many, but it's still a feature that's highly requested by players. Being able to team up for multiplayer matches or zombies sounds like a fantastic idea for a Friday night.\n\n\nWill there be Call of Duty Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op?\n\n\nActivision has provided a few details about Black Ops 6 through a short Q&A section on its support website. “Split-screen gameplay (two players sharing a screen) for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5,\" said Activision. \"To ensure performance integrity, split-screen gameplay will not be supported on Xbox One or PlayStation 4.”\n\n\nBlack Ops 6 will have splitscreen co-op but there's a catch.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the PS4 and Xbox One versions won't support Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op, at least from day one of its launch. \n\n\nIt's great to see splitscreen co-op still being supported in 2024, and the Call of Duty series has a history of implementing the feature into its games. Last year's Modern Warfare 3 has it, for example.\n\n\nSplitscreen shooters on PS4 and Xbox One\n\n\nNow that Activision has sunset splitscreen functionality within its PS4 and Xbox One ports of Call of Duty games, you don't want that seat next to you completely empty. Thankfully, there are still some shooters you can play with a pal with split-screen on the older consoles. One example is the Borderlands series, including the most recent Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. You can hook up two controllers and get as much loot as you can gather together. \n\n\nTiny Tina's Wonderlands has splitscreen co-op\n\n\nIf you're on the Xbox One, the Halo Master Chief Collection is a good way to go. You can play through the campaigns with a buddy, and you can wreck fools online as well with some split-screen action just like the old days.\n\nThe post Does Call of Duty Black Ops 6 support splitscreen co-op? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Ops has been known to have some of the best Zombies modes, thanks to its highly entertaining maps. The sixth iteration will continue this tradition with an all-new undead challenge. Here's what you can expect in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode.\n\n\nWhat to expect in Black Ops 6 Zombies\n\n\nGet ready to relive the nostalgia as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 brings back the classic round-based Zombies mode, a feature that was dearly missed in the latest MW3 Zombies. Prepare to face endless hordes of zombies, with each round escalating the challenge with more formidable foes.\n\n\nTerminus and Liberty Falls are the two new round-based Zombies maps. We've seen a glimpse of some locations featuring a tropical-esque map in the trailer. \n\n\n\n\nAs for the timeline, Black Ops 6 Zombies takes place sometime after Black Ops Cold War, continuing the Dark Aether narrative that has been a central theme in the previous games. It isn't clear if this will also involve Modern Warfare 3's Dark Aether Rifts, but this entry may not be a part of the BO universe.\n\n\nPack-a-Punch and power-ups will likely be available throughout the map. Specifically, the GobbleGums will make their epic return, currently available for purchase in the Vault Edition. These unique abilities, such as the Burned Out GobbleGum that makes zombies burst into fire, were a hit in Black Ops 3 and are sure to add a new dimension to your gameplay in Black Ops 6's Zombies mode.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nOperator skins are also available to go along with the Zombies mode. This includes the Warden of Alcatraz skin, Brutus, and the Reborn skin, Klaus. These Operators can be equipped during the Black Ops 6 Open Beta, and you can check out our guide on this to see when it starts.\n\n\nLike many Zombies entries, Easter Eggs can be found throughout the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies map. These hidden gems typically provide challenges to embark on as a solo player or with a team.\n\nThe post Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies mode, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

While a lot of mods are stat boosts that heavily improve a particular aspect of your gear, others can completely change the way that gear functions or even improve the experience a ton. One such mod not only adds a new system for your melee weapon but also improves that system considerably. Here's how to get the Dreamer's Wrath mod in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to get the Dreamer's Wrath mod in Warframe\n\n\nImage via Digital Extremes.\n\n\nThe Dreamer's Wrath mod is acquired through the Alchemy mission type, found on the node Cambire on Deimos. If you don't have access to this mission yet, you'll need to progress the Warframe story until you've completed the Whispers in the Walls main quest. The quest unlocks the Alchemy mission type, along with several other Entrati Labs levels. \n\n\nOnce you get into it, progress through the mission until you've completed four rotations (bringing the Conversion Process to 100% four times). This gives you a Rotation C reward, which offers a 6% chance to drop Dreamer's Wrath.\n\n\nAlongside Dreamer's Wrath, Rotation C of this Alchemy mission provides the following rewards at the following chances:\n\n\n\n1,200x Endo - 20%\n\n\nMandonel Receiver - 16%\n\n\nMandonel Stock - 16%\n\n\nCondition's Perfect - 12%\n\n\nMaster's Edge - 12%\n\n\nOpportunity's Reach - 12%\n\n\nDiscipline's Merit - 6%\n\n\n\nIs the Dreamer's Wrath mod worth using?\n\n\nDreamer's Wrath is a melee mod that enables Tennokai, a system that improves Heavy Attacks when timed correctly. Compared to other Tennokai mods, this mod increases the chance to trigger a Tennokai attack by 50% and critical damage of these attacks by 32%. If you want to have Tennokai on your weapon, there aren't many mods better than Dreamer's Wrath.

Here's how to get accessories in Type Soul and what type of clothing you can expect.\n\n\nWhere to get accessories in Type Soul\n\n\nThe Accessory Shop in Type Soul is nestled in Karakura town, marked with a distinctive clothing hanger sign. To reach this area, use the Senkaimon ability to transport there or The Key if you're a Quincy. Even if you're a beginner, these techniques are within your grasp via the skills menu. Upon entering this town, you'll find yourself at a random location, so keep an eye out for a brick wall near the waterside.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGiven that there are two brick walls in Karakura town, the correct one will have an outlook of some city buildings.

It should be next to some white buildings. \n\n\n\n\n\nGo through the shop doors to speak to Nel Tu, who will provide a list of accessories to purchase in Type Soul.

The game is arriving on console and PC on August 29, still well within the previously established summer 2024 launch window.\n\n\nSquare dropped the news earlier today along with a nearly four-minute launch trailer showcasing characters, enemies, and the game's gorgeous world. There do seem to be some hints at plot turns in the trailer, so you may want to avoid it if you want to be unspoiled. Granted, what's being revealed appears to be rather light. \n\n\n\n\nThe series returns in August\n\n\nVisions of Mana isn't a remake or remaster, but a new game in the 33-year-old series (and the first in 15 years).

          "description": "Atlus has announced via its Japanese site that they are dropping veteran voice actor Toru Furuya from the cast of Metaphor: ReFantazio. While the statement only says that they’re dropping the actor for “various reasons,” it most likely has to do with reporting by Shūkan Bunshun that alleged the actor had a four-and-a-half year affair with a much younger fan.\n\n\nToru Furuya posted a message on Twitter back in May to apologize to fans. In his statement, he confirmed the affair with the fan, who was reportedly 37 years younger than him, as well as the fact that he, at one point, struck her. He also reportedly coerced the woman into getting an abortion after she became pregnant.\n\n\nFollowing the reporting, many companies chose to distance from the actor, with the Showroom streaming service dropping his program and his appearance at Momocon 2024 being canceled.\n\n\nToru Furuya is a prolific voice actor, with roles going back to the ‘60s. He’s lent his voice to characters such as Yamcha from Dragon Ball, Amuro Ray in Mobile Suit Gundam, and Tuxedo Mask in Sailor Moon. He also, for a time, voiced Mario in the anime movie Super Mario Bros: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!, as well as various commercials.\n\n\nAtlus has stated that they’ll announce who is filling the role in July. Metaphor: ReFantazio is slated to be released on October 11, 2024.\n\nThe post Atlus is recasting Toru Furuya’s role in Metaphor: ReFantazio appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hatsune Miku is a version of Fitness Boxing that features Hatsune Miku, if that wasn’t clear.\n\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar, Fitness Boxing is an alleged exercise game where you perform various boxing punches in time to pop music instrumentals. If you’re unfamiliar with Hatsune Miku, she’s a Vocaloid voicebank that broke free from her software prison to become a full-fledged pop star. If you’re unfamiliar with Vocaloid, it’s a voice synthesizer so you can experience what it’s like to control a computerized voice before they control us.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not a terribly weird mix when you consider that Hatsune Miku is a music… thing and Fitness Boxing is a rhythm game. However, she’s not what I think of when I think about fitness or boxing. We last saw Fitness Boxing: Fist of the North Star, and while that’s a license that isn’t focused on boxing, it is at least fighting-adjacent. Punches are often thrown.\n\n\nFitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku will set you up to train with Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, and Megurine Luka, with Lin and Evan from the core Fitness Boxing series joining as instructors. I don’t know who any of these people are. It will feature 24 songs from Piapro, along with \"Melt\" and \"The Vampire” which I’m guessing are popular.\n\n\nI don’t have much familiarity with Hatsune Miku. I was considering getting Fitness Boxing 2, since I recently started taking Muay Thai kickboxing lessons. Not that I think it will help, but it might at least be fun exercise that aligns somewhat with my new interest.\n\n\nFitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku has a vague release date of Fall for the West on Switch. It’s already out in Japan and is supposed to come out in the rest of Asia on July 12.\n\nThe post Next Fitness Boxing starring legendary boxer Hatsune Miku coming West this Fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai.

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kwo41nUwyeo\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.</p>\n\n<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2aqnWFpRAY\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is planned for release this year, but we still don't know the release date.</p>\n\n                  <section class='type:slideshow'><figure><img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/06/09/7e147c08/indianajones2.jpg'></figure><figure><img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/06/09/a8447b16/indianajones4.jpg'></figure><figure><img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/06/09/1ffc848e/indianajones1.jpg'></figure><figure><img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/06/09/50fd4d08/indianajones3.jpg'></figure></section>\n          &nbsp;",

Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofUi9DR9sc4\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OjL3a5ZOFNo\" width=\"640\"></iframe>",

Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.</p>\n\n<p>Revealed during the Future of Play Direct players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/smvxkjXiZzM\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a \"star-consuming threat.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date.
