Because, let's not forget, the OG Switch reveal kicked off with a strange photo of Mario peeking around a curtain — something former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang were keen to unpack on the latest episode of their podcast (thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything).\nAccording to the pair's answer, the photo was \"very controversial\", with Nintendo worrying the image wouldn't adequately manage people's expectations. According to Kit, \"You always need more assets than you think you do\" with a big announcement like a console reveal, but Nintendo didn't have anything fitting for this occasion so had to turn to a \"last-second\" photoshoot.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But while none fail here, none really excel either.\nAs the game takes off, you hear the voice of your father, inviting you to Europa \"if you ever get lonely.\" You take control of Zee, an android in the form of a young boy who totters past Adam’s gravestone (the father in question) to explore the land.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.\nRead more",

Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of \"psychogeography mechanic\"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective \"solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time\"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.\nRead more",

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. \nIt’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.\n Read more",

Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.\r\n \nRead more",

Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.\n Read more",

          "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 won't be an \"open sim\" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been \"mythologised\" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply \"wouldn't fly today\".\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

          "description": "A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.\nIn which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.\nRead more",

But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.\nThere's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. \n Read more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.\nAnd then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.\nRead more",

Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.\nMetaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.\nRead more",

I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.\nAt the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl.

          "description": "My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.\nLurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.\nRead more",

Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, \"interoperable\" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not.

          "description": "Out 17th October on Steam, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.\n  \nRead more",

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going \"boo!\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. \r\n \nRead more",

The news was officially revealed via an announcement video, which confirmed that the anime will resume its Egghead arc next spring.\n\n\n\n\nThe hiatus will allow the anime's production team to \"recharge,\" as confirmed during the live-streamed special titled \"One Piece News #1.\" To fill the gap left by the hiatus, the One Piece Fan Letter special will air on October 20, followed by a special edited version of the fan-favorite Fish-Man Island arc on October 27. \n\n\nAccording to Anime News Network, this version of the arc will offer a fresh viewing experience, featuring retouched art, enhanced color shading and lighting, special effects, and a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.\n\n\nIn addition to the anime, One Piece is expanding its presence in the digital space. One Piece Base, a new smartphone app featuring a manga viewer and other franchise-related content, launches in Japan on Sunday. However, the app is also slated to be released globally next year. \n\n\nThe app will allow users to unlock chapters using points. These points can be earned via scanning barcodes from One Piece merchandise, logging into the app daily, and inviting friends. The app also includes the portrait maker which transforms fans' selfies into art reminiscent of Oda's signature style.\n\nThe post One Piece anime is going on hiatus, returning April 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Camellya is one of the most hyped characters upcoming in Wuthering Waves, and her arrival can get here fast enough. With her being announced as a playable character some weeks back, if you're wondering when you can actually start pulling copies of her, here's what you need to know.\n\n\nWhen does Camellya come out in Wuthering Waves?\n\n\nWhile Kuro Games has not given any details as to when Camellya will officially be released, she has been announced, which does imply a release sooner than you might think if you pay attention to how the banner system works in Wuthering Waves. \n\n\nWhen a character is considered the 'Featured Rate-up', it means they are currently on the banner and available to be pulled. Typically, banners last a few weeks a month, with two total banners taking up the duration of an entire major patch. We know for certain that Camellya will be released in Version 1.4 of Wuthering Waves. Currently, we are in Version 1.3, and the current Rate-up character is The Shorekeeper. After her banner ends, there's a high chance there will be a re-run of a previously released character since no second character was announced by Kuro Games for 1.3.\n\n\nImage via Kuro Games\n\n\nIn a similar vein, there has been no second character announced for Version 1.4. Only Camellya has been officially announced, which suggests that she is the first character to be a Rate-up in 1.4. If this is indeed the case (which is highly likely at this point), that means that Camellya will release following the re-run character in 1.3. In conclusion, based on these insights, Camellya is highly likely to release on November 14, which is just after the re-run character's banner ends and likely when Version 1.4 officially releases.\n\nThe post When can you pull for Camellya in Wuthering Waves? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the Episode battle mode allows you to enjoy some amazing storylines featuring your favorite characters. \n\n\nIn total, eight characters are present in the Episode battle mode, but two of them remain locked - Future Trunks and Jiren. Thankfully, you can unlock the paths for both by just playing the game. Doing so not only lets you play out their canonical storyline, but both also have alternate Sparking episodes present. Without wasting any time, let's take a look at how you can unlock and play with Jiren and Future Trunks in the episode battle mode.\n\n\nHow to unlock Future Trunks and Jiren in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero's episodes?\n\n\nWhile unlocking Sparking episodes in certain cases can be quite difficult, getting access to Jiren and Future Trunks in Episode mode is easy.\n\n\nTo unlock episodes for both, you'll need to play through Goku's saga. To be more specific, you'll have to end Universe Survival Arc to get access to Jiren's episodes. Similarly, you'll need to complete the Future Trunks Arc to unlock the episodes for Future Trunks. Both these tasks can be achieved in Chapter 7 of Goku's Saga. Incidentally, you'll always begin with Goku when starting Episode battle mode for the first time.\n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nIt took me close to two hours to unlock, but it can take less time if you finish your previous quests quicker (quite possibly, given my abilities as a Dragon Ball Sparking Zero player).\n\n\nBetween the two, Future Trunks' saga is a lot more elaborate. He has more episodes for both Canon and Sparking. Jiren's story is a lot more linear, and the episodes don't change a lot based on canon or Sparking (although the ending changes). Ultimately, unlocking the two sagas will not only help you explore greater parts of the story and gain more exp and Zeni while doing so.\n\nThe post Dragon Ball Sparking Zero: How to unlock Future Trunks and Jiren’s episodes appeared first on Destructoid.",

Despite being unreleased, Deadlock has harnessed immense popularity, and there is no doubt that players would love to grind since this game shows a promising future. This article will tell you everything you need to know about the ranked mode in Deadlock.\n\n\nEverything you need to know about Ranked mode in Deadlock\n\n\nImage via Valve\n\n\nBasically, Deadlock will feature 11 Medals that you can attain in the ranked mode. Each Medals will have six levels that you have to progress to advance further. It is also important to know that these Medals are going to be updated once a week.\n\n\nThere are also a few criteria of ranked mode that you have to keep in mind. Here are those criteria:\n\n\n\nFirst, you must have played atleast 50 games to unlock the ranked mode in Deadlock. This criteria is pretty much obvious as developers try to avoid spam of new accounts entering into the ranked mode.\n\n\nSecond, you can’t play the Ranked mode everytime since the servers will only be opened during 1-4 P.M. and 7-10 P.M. Remember, this time is the same across all the regions, and it is not customized to benefit only one region.\n\n\nThird, you have to play at least seven-ranked matches to actually progress into a new rank each week.\n\n\nFourth, you can queue in the solo-ranked mode only.\n\n\n\nAlso, since the game is still in development, there is no behaviour restriction in the ranked mode. Hopefully, the developers will add this feature in the future or once the game is released.\n\nThe post ‪Deadlock: Ranked mode, explained‬ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.\nAre you ready to play?
