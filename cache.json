          "description": "\"We do not give away our software\".\nNintendo has a history of bundling games with hardware, going back to the NES and Game Boy era. Yet it's never been a fixed policy, nor one that's always matched between regions. Take Wii Sports as an example - it became integral bundled in with the Wii offering when it was included in all territories apart from Japan, where it was sold separately. Those copies included in system boxes counted in software sales, so it's the 'best-selling' Wii game at 82.9 million copies, against 101.63 Wii systems sold.\nThere's little doubt it was vital to the early appeal of the console, which contributed to it becoming such a success story for Nintendo. Yet getting the title bundled was evidently the result of multiple challenging meetings internally, as Reggie Fils-Aimé outlines in his new book.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Every little helps 'n' all that.\nIf you cast your minds back to the mid 2000s, you'll remember that the WarioWare series was just starting to take off, with the launch of WarioWare Inc.: Mega Microgame$! in 2003 making a big splash on GBA. The earlier titles in the series didn't feature much voice acting, and it wasn't until the 3DS entry WarioWare Gold in 2018 that we started properly hearing the dulcet tones of Wario himself.\nWell, it turns out that nearly a decade prior, Charles Marinet himself completed a fairly substantial advertisement gig for WarioWare D.I.Y on the Nintendo DS in 2009. You may remember the advertisement itself if you're based in the UK, but it essentially featured Wario's voice describing the game itself, before prompting customers to head to TESCO, a very specific British supermarket chain. You can check out the footage and accompanying voiceover work in the video below.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Intriguing insights blended with business can-do tropes.\nReggie Fils-Aimé is an iconic figurehead of 21st Century Nintendo, arriving in the public eye at a pivotal moment of the company's history as it underwent a Satoru Iwata-led revolution. After the GameCube's challenging generation in the face of new competition from Microsoft's Xbox and the all-conquering Sony PlayStation 2, Fils-Aimé famously appeared on stage at E3 2004, introduced himself with a bold line about kicking ass and taking names, and later plucked a DS from his pocket. Undoubtedly, he was immediately a key face of Nintendo with gamers in the Americas and Europe, in particular.\nWhile much of his image and known history among fans relates to meme-worthy E3 moments or his prominent role in Nintendo, his broader story is less familiar. With his new book, 'Disrupting the Game, From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo', we do get to learn more about Fils-Aimé's background and pre-Nintendo career, but any interested readers should know upfront this is not a traditional autobiography. It occasionally strays towards that territory, but primarily this is a business book, the type that outlines how boldness, ideas and determination can see anyone rise and meet their goals. One for the 'Leadership' category in the book store.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Lauren played the demo a few months back and found it to be lovely, and indeed, what's not to love about a pretty 2D world where you potter about and plant things, and trade things with different anthropomorphic animals that wander through.

Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.\nRead more",

Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident. \nRead more",

Personally, I'm hoping we'll see our first proper gameplay footage of Starfield, given it launches almost five months to the day from that date. There could also finally be some movement on in-development projects like the next Fable from Playground Games and Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3 too. Here's hoping!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Heck, even the allure of daily challenges in some of my favourite single-player games has never quite hooked me in the same way I've seen them take hold in friends and family.

First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There’s also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.\r\n\n\r\nBut most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There’s an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe – a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content – there’s another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've given myself the span of a fairly short post to try and convince you, dear reader, to give Rocket Bot Royale a shot. It looks like a browser-based game, and it is. It looks like it's probably not worth anyone's time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.\nAs I've made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I'll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I'm starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It's Worms, but with tanks. It's free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.\nRead more",

Not because it's bad, but because I'm really enjoying it, and I think it has the potential to really take off.\nThink of these complaints, for the most part, as a pre-flight checklist done long before the pilot has even sat down; if the game were not in early access, these would be big disappointments rather than exactly the kind of annoying details that early access is meant to iron out.\nRead more",

This new PIN protection leads a bevy of other features including localised keyboards, a redesigned achievements page, and support for games and apps with multiple windows, which you can now flick between via the Steam button menu.\r\n\n\r\nWithout the update, it’s possible to just sign into your Steam account once and never need to punch in credentials again, even after a full restart. This is convenient, especially if your Steam Deck isn’t at risk of chicanery from young siblings or vengeful housemates, but giving it the Deck a lock screen goes a long way in guarding it from prying hands. It’s definitely worth the longer-than-usual update installation, at any rate.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Prices for third-party cards are slowly falling, and now have reached within £100 of the £549 UK RRP - an important milestone for GPUs that cost £1000 or more at the beginning of the year. \nThe cheapest RTX 3070 Ti model we've found is a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity at Ebuyer, who are asking £649 with a despatch date of April 26th(tomorrow!). If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for £10 more. Either way, you'll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia's higher-end GPUs and much less than the company's next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year. \nRead more",

The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.\nThe game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.\nRead more",

Now, everyone's favourite bomb disposal expert is back in McPixel 3 (solo developer Sos Sosowski prefers we never mention the likes of McPixel 2), which we got to see in action over at the Devolver booth at PAX East 2022. Sosowski took the reins for us in this demo, showing us exactly how not to save the world in this equally comedic sequel, proving that the McPixel formula is still just as potent ten years on from the original. \nRead more",

Moderated by Overclocking-TV.com's Isaïe \"Trouffman\" Simonnet with special guests Joe Gialanella from ModMyMods, Eric \"hobbseltoff\" Hobbs from PC Modding Enthusiast, and Justin \"Robeytech\" Robey, these four experts took us through the history of PC modding over the last 15 years, the highs and lows of some of their very own builds, and what lies in store for PC modding going forward. It was a fascinating panel, and we caught up with Simonnet afterwards to try and recapture some of that excellent hardware chat for you folks at home. \nRead more",

You can watch for yourselves below. Skip to about five minutes from before the end if you’re just interested in the Tales From The Borderlands announcement.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Do you think \"what have you been doing to give your life meaning?\" is a cool way to start a conversation? A better prompt than you'd normally encounter? A big question, rather than small talk? Then you will probably be more open to the delights of Glitchhikers, a game where where you talk about choice and predetermination to what appears to be sentient windchimes while driving along a one-way motorway. Where you take a nighttime walk around a park peopled with meditating animals who have opinions about magic.\nRead more",

Get well soon, Swen. Larian have styled the release date announcement as a look back at Baldur’s Gate 3’s “journey so far” while it’s been in early access. It’s a bit daft, but neatly summarises how the game has evolved over the past two years.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In the latter category, first prize definitely goes to the trio of highly cursed doll babies scattered around the stand for Chernobylite, the post-apocalyptic survival horror roguelite that came out last year. They were also accompanied by two gas masks, casually strewn across the corners of TV screens, but nothing compared to the truly haunted look of these semi-melted plastic husks. \nRead more",

Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo si chcete jenom popovídat, doražte, jste srdečně vítáni! Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Thanks to the music he created for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, alongside his mentor of six years, Mark Mothersbaugh, he’s now an official American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers awards winner. \nThat’s because Hokoyama has received the Video Game Score of the Year award for Rift Apart by way of the 2022 ASCAP Screen Music Awards. Of course, Mothersbaugh helped create the score as well, but he’s not with ASCAP, so the award, on paper, goes to Hokoyama alone.

          "description": "As 2022 continues to be the year of acquisitions, with news that Square Enix is selling Embracer Group three of its western development studios and more than 50 IPs, it seems Sony is still looking to bolster its first-party family.\nThat’s because the company is now hiring for a Corporate Development Director, “responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions,” and more, as discovered by Roberto Serrano’ on Twitter and reported by Video Games Chronicle. It’s not surprising that Sony is looking to hire somebody like this, especially when you look at the current video game landscape – it feels like every other week, a major acquisition is announced. \n“Sony Interactive Entertainment seeks a highly qualified Director, Corporate Development,” Sony’s job listing reads. “SIE’s Corporate Development Team works closely with SIE’s management team and is responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures. The team sources, evaluates, and completes transactions that are aligned with SIE’s strategic priorities and drive significant long-term value for the company.”\nElsewhere in the listing, it says Sony is looking for someone to drive proactive deal sourcing, including developing relationships with external and internal partners. \nNews that Sony is looking for what is essentially an acquisitions director is not surprising – acquisitions have largely defined gaming in 2022 thus far. It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, the following week, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion. Two weeks after that, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie for $3.6 billion and later announced it had acquired Jade Raymond’s new studio, Haven Studios. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]",

Going even further, they’ve played Elden Ring using it. Controller modder Rudeism (on Twitter) posted a clip yesterday of him using this modded controller to play Elden Ring and while that alone is impressive, what makes it better is that the Fisher-Price controller still lights up and makes all the sounds it usually does. \nhere's the Fisher Price Xbox controller in action!\n@Wario64 for the off-hand joke that inspired me to make this happen 😂 pic.twitter.com/3OETvcsEsI\nMay 1, 2022\nAs you can see in the video above, it’s quite a hilarious mod. As for how fun actually playing Elden Ring with this controller is, well, only Rudeism knows but something tells us it’s going to be a little harder to take down Radahn this way. Imagine dying to Radahn, while he has just a sliver of health left, only to hear a Fisher-Price song begin playing, almost as if to taunt you in your death. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then read about the latest Elden Ring patch, which fixes an infamous Malenia bug. Check out this Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the game’s closed colosseum, where they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies inside. \n[Source: The Verge]\nDo you think you could beat Elden Ring with this Fisher-Price controller?

Ranging from the Crash Bandicoot series, including its kart racing spinoff Crash Team Racing, to Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Resident Evil, and more, these covers are so good we wish the comics were real.

          "description": "We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing the second game in Supergiant's catalog, Transistor.\nReleased for PlayStation 4 on May 18, 2014, and PC a day later, Transistor was a very different game for Supergiant to make compared to its freshman effort a few years prior. Development started just a few months following the release of Bastion, and while its first game was a success, the tight-knit studio wanted to prove what it did wasn't lightning in a bottle. In this episode, we discuss the various ways Supergiant pushed against the ever-present shadow of Bastion in the games design and the studio's production methods. We also cover the process of creating a new retro-inspired cyberpunk setting, the unique tactical action combat, and how the studio landed on a voiceless lounge singer named Red and her talking sword, the Transistor, as the main characters.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Magazine Content Director Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Transistor! \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Jill Grodt, and Wesley LeBlanc on Twitch today at a special start time of 12:30 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

          "description": "Final Fantasy is a staple in JRPGs and video games as a whole. It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won’t be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. \nHowever, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best.

What’s more, it’s available for pre-order now for $299.99, and if it’s something you just have to have, you should act fast because there are only 1000 of them in total. Pre-orders are expected to ship sometime between November of this year and January 2023. So if you buy one, you don’t have to wait too long to have it in your hands. \n\n“Reaper Sovereign has landed on Eden Prime after 50,000 years and is reigning down planet-shattering destruction,” Dark Horse’s description reads. “This spectacular replica is made of polyresin and crafted by the masters at Gentle Giant Studios. At 14 inches tall on an 11-inch diameter base, this statue will have you re-experiencing this iconic moment from Mass Effect.” \nGentle Giant Studios is responsible for the sculpting, prototyping, and paint of the replica, which is made out of polyresin, and you can only order a maximum of two. While waiting for yours to arrive, read our breakdown of the reveal trailer for the next Mass Effect game, which was announced in 2020. After that, read about how the next Mass Effect could revert back to using Unreal Engine instead of EA’s Frostbite, and then check out the latest teaser for the next Mass Effect. \nAre you going to pick up one of these replica Reaper ships?

While these games have been around as long as the industry, their popularity surged in the early 2000s. This was partly due to new digital distribution and crowdfunding options, which presented opportunities for some would-be game makers.\nThough many of gaming’s best-loved indies belong to this early era, independently made games reached a whole new level of mainstream attention in the following decades.

It sounds very Modern Warfare-y and looks very Modern Warfare-y, too, but it doesn’t reveal much about the actual game. Perhaps there’s something to be made out of the muddled voices playing during the trailer, but it’s likely that this teaser is just setting the stage for a bigger reveal in the coming weeks or months. The Call of Duty account that tweeted out the teaser does say, “The new era of Call of Duty is coming,” so perhaps the company believes this game will shake up the franchise in a big way. \nIt wouldn’t be surprising because Infinity Ward's 2019 Modern Warfare reboot did just that for the series, especially in its rollout a few months before Call of Duty: Warzone. Plus, 2019’s Modern Warfare is still regarded by many as the best Call of Duty in recent years. With Infinity Ward working on Modern Warfare II, fans are likely excited to see what this sequel looks like. Sadly, there’s no telling when the next look will be but if it’s like Call of Duty reveals in years past, we could be weeks or even days away. Only time will tell.\nIn the meantime, read about how a sequel to Warzone is expected to drop this year and then check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023.

It boasts a 4K resolution and a readjusted UI. Content-wise, it includes the locations from the base game and introduces a new character, quests, and events. \nAdditionally, the three DLC narrative episodes, This War of Mine: Stories, will be available for purchase separately on PS5/XSX. This War of Mine: Complete Edition is a bundle containing Final Cut and Stories if you want everything.  \n11 Bit Studios, based in Poland, states that the ongoing Ukraine/Russia conflict is the motivator to re-release This War of Mine and repromote its anti-war messaging to a new group of players. The studio recently raised nearly $700,000 for Ukrainian civilian aid by heavily discounting the previous versions of This War of Mine. 11 Bit CEO Przemek Marszal says in a press release: \n\"The message and themes existing inside of This War of Mine have, unfortunately, become brutally vivid and relevant in recent months. We believe it’s especially important to educate people on the realities of war right now, while its horrifying reality has become a daily struggle for people that are close to us. We’re proud that recent This War of Mine fundraising helped us create a wave of spontaneous help for war victims in Ukraine, and we hope we can further spread our antiwar message with This War of Mine: Final Cut.”\nFor more on This War of Mine, check out our review of the original 2014 release here.

In an especially fitting way to highlight the game’s distinctiveness, the game makers partnered with Aaron Newman, a professional LEGO-building artist, to create a custom LEGO set of the ship seen in the game.

On May 3, subscribers will have access to the following titles: \nFIFA 22: Last year’s FIFA title boasts new-gen visuals and enhancements, making for a football title that looks better than it ever has. Though it ultimately doesn’t differ too much from FIFA 21, fans of the sport should find it an enjoyable, if not very familiar, simulator. | Our Review\nTribes of Midgard: This colorful Norse-themed survival action game that you can experience alone or with friends in co-op. You’ll build and manage a village that up to 10 players can occupy, and you’ll maintain it by harvesting materials out in the wild. Plenty of dangers, both earthly and mythical, lurk in the wilderness for you and a party to cut down with your sword. \nCurse of the Dead Gods: As an explorer fueled by greed, you’ll explore the depths of perilous temples battling monsters and plundering treasure in this run-based action roguelite. Surviving floor after floor of dangers requires accumulating powerful runes, but gaining power also saddles you with curses for a risk vs reward element. | Our Review\nIf you haven’t added April’s batch of PS Plus titles to your library, you have until May 2 to do so before they become unavailable. You’ll want to do the same for Persona 5, which is also exiting the PS Plus Collection on May 11. \nThis will presumably be the final month of PS Plus as we know it before the introduction of new premium tiers in June.

Players control Trevor Hills, an average town resident who discovers his entire world is just an elaborate reality TV show broadcasted 24/7 to millions of Americans. To escape his false existence, Trevor teams up with the show’s stage technician, Angela Solano, and the pair must work together to evade the clutches of Arcadia’s security forces. \n\n\nAmerican Arcadia features two gameplay styles. Trevor's action unfolds as a 2.5D action side-scroller fearing plenty of puzzle-solving as well as elements of stealth. Controlling Angela shifts the game to first-person to complete specific hacking and puzzle segments. Cissy Jones and Yuri Lowenthal, who portrayed Call of the Sea’s protagonists, reunite to voice Angela and Trevor, respectively.\nAmerican Arcadia has already been selected for Tribeca’s 2022 Festival Games.

          "description": "From Software released a new patch today that fixes a Malenia bug that unintentionally made the boss fight much harder. \nDubbed Update Version 1.04.1, this patch fixes a bug with the Malenia, Blade of Miquella boss fight in Elden Ring’s endgame that allowed her to heal herself at any time if you were in online co-op. This was a problem because Malenia is only supposed to self-heal upon damaging you, in a vampiric way. That she was able to self-heal at really any time was causing quite the conundrum for players looking to defeat her, who is already arguably the most challenging boss in the entire game. This new patch fixes that fortunately, and it brings with it a few other fixes too. \n\n\nHere’s what Update Version 1.04.1 brings to Elden Ring: \nFixed a bug in which the effect duration of the Cerulean Hidden Tears was revised downward\nFixed a bug with Malenia, Blade of Miquella in which her HP was not healed correctly in the online multiplayer environment\nFixed a bug that causes some bosses to die at unintended times.\nFixed a bug that prevented the boss “Elden Beast” from working properly under certain circumstances\nFixed some texts\n“The version number of this update shown at the lower right corner of the Title Screen will be as follows: App Ver. 1.04.1, Regulation Ver. 1.04.2,” the patch notes read. \nAs expected, in order to play online in Elden Ring, you must have this update installed. For more about the game, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about an Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the closed colosseum, where once inside, they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies.

So, it feels serendipitous that I’m reviewing Switch Sports 16 years later. Diving into the second sequel’s six activities alone and with friends (locally) has been a fun, nostalgic rush. I haven’t had access to the game's online multiplayer component, which, as you can imagine, houses a bulk of Switch Sports’ content.

          "description": "Matt Reeves’ The Batman is getting a sequel, to probably nobody’s surprise. \nNot only did the movie do really well at the box office, especially as the silver screen continues to struggle to bounce back amidst the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, but it was well-received by both critics and fans alike. Now, DC has confirmed that The Batman will get a sequel with Matt Reeves returning to write and direct and Robert Pattinson set to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader, as reported by Variety. \nThe publication notes that this was announced last night during Warner Bros. CinemaCon presentation and while the company revealed a sequel is happening, not much else was shared. As for a villain or storyline, we’re all still just as in the dark as we were before the sequel was revealed. However, those who have seen The Batman, which is now streaming on HBO Max for subscribers, there are a number of threads the sequel could move forward with, both in terms of potential villains and potential storylines. We won’t spoil those threads here, but The Batman sequel seems to be heading in a certain direction. \nThe Batman hit theaters last month, raking in $134 million domestically, Variety reports, and its ticket sales still represent the biggest opening weekend for any movie in 2022. Today, its global box office sits around $759 million, making it the highest grossing movie of the year thus far (although Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is eyeing that throne). \nWhile waiting for a sequel to The Batman, read Game Informer’s coverage of two upcoming DC games, Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat villains would you like to see in a sequel to The Batman?

          "description": "Sega has announced plans to delist the digital versions of the classic Sonic games that will be included in its upcoming Sonic Origins collection.\nSonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3 & Knuckles, and CD will be removed from online storefronts on May 20, a little over a month before the June 30 launch of Sonic Origins. There will be two exceptions. The Sega Ages versions of Sonic 1 and 2 for Switch will remain playable. The same immunity applies to Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis library for the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.\nSega has not cited a reason for this move, but the publisher evidently wants to steer players towards Origins if they want their classic Sonic fix. Rockstar Games made a similar move when it delisted the PC versions of the Grand Theft Auto games that appeared in last year’s ill-fated Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition. The decision earned significant backlash from fans before the collection launched, as many felt Rockstar was limiting their options for purchasing the classic entries. That situation further backfired due to the Trilogy’s botched release, and Rockstar eventually restored the standalone GTA titles to PC storefronts. \nSonic Origins bundles remastered versions of the Genesis-era platformers. It boasts enhancements such as new and improved animations, new gameplay modes, and the option to play as Tails/Knuckles in each game, among other features. It’s slated to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms, Switch, and PC. The game comes in two editions – a $39.99 standard version and a $44.99 Deluxe – with a few content packs that you can read about here.",

It will repeat non-stop for 72 hours until Monday, May 2, at 6 p.m. EST. To accompany Emicida’s performance, the Keep Going Lobby Track and Triumphant Emote will be available in the Fortnite Item Shop starting this Thursday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST. Upon completing Emicada’s experience, you’ll receive some XP and the Soundwave Series – Emicada Spray as a memento from the show. \nAs for what to expect beyond the actual performance, you’ll find a creative island inspired by Emicida’s life journey and how it influenced his music, made by community creators BertBuilds, Paradox Builds, and Zen Creative. \n“The setlist, which includes some of Emicida’s biggest hits, tells the story of how he grew up in Jardim Cachoeira in the north of São Paulo, Brazil, and became one of the most popular rappers in Brazil and a successful artist worldwide,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “In the experience, Emicida shares a bit of his path as a rapper, from where he was doing street rap battles to becoming recognized internationally.” \n\nPlayers will have the option to watch the show via Picture-in-Picture while playing other Creative Experiences, Battle Royale, and more if they don’t want to experience it on the creator-built island. However, Epic Games says this is available only during certain times of the event. It can be accessed through the game’s settings, but interactive elements will not be playable if the experience is viewed through Picture-in-Picture. \nFor more about Emicida’s Soundwave Series event, read the full Epic Games blog post. \nAre you excited to see Emicida perform?

          "description": "Players suspect that a closed colosseum in Elden Ring could be the location for a potential PvP-based DLC or expansion. Popular From Software modder Lance McDonald was able to look inside it with a mod. He confirmed that the colosseum’s outer walls aren’t just set dressing but actual walls to an arena. \nAs reported by Video Games Chronicle, another From Software modder, Sekiro Dubi, used a mod to enter the colosseum and explore it even further. Surprisingly, Sekiro Dubi discovered not just a colosseum to explore, but two additional Elden Ring enemies and even a new Site of Grace, which are Elden Ring’s version of Dark Souls' bonfires. \n\n\nAs noted by VGC, the Site of Grace seems to indicate that this area was reachable within the game at one point or another, unless, of course, this Site of Grace will become reachable one day in a patch or DLC that allows players into the colosseum. Sekiro Dubi notes in their video above that the Site of Grace is called “?PlaceName?” (an obvious placeholder name) in the locations menu, but they point out that leaked Network Test files point to it being called Leyndell Colosseum. \nAs far as new enemies go, there’s a Gladiator Large and an Old Lion of the Arena, neither of which can be found elsewhere in Elden Ring. Sekiro Dubi notes that in-game lore indicates that this colosseum was a place where warriors fought against beasts. \nFor now, this colosseum remains inaccessible to the standard playerbase as it’s only reachable via mods. However, many speculate that it will become a PvP arena someday. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about how Elden Ring was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the second month in a row. Read about the latest Elden Ring patch that adjusts sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nDo you want the colosseum to become a PvP-based arena?

A cinematic trailer dropped yesterday, revealing the game’s next defensive legend, Newcastle, while showcasing Titanfall Spectres and feral wildlife along Storm Point’s tropical beaches. You can watch the footage below. \n\n\nApex loremasters might already know that Bangalore has a friendly rivalry and close relationship with her older brother, Jackson. While protecting Bangalore during the Battle of Gridiron, Jackson is presumed KIA. We join Bangalore after some time has passed; she’s announced her retirement from the Apex Games. At the same time, a masked defender named Newcastle is slated to be her replacement. Of course, explosive hijinks ensue while the two squad up for Bangalore’s final battle royale match. Bullets whiz past faces, grenades leave craters in the sand, and Titanfall Spectres ambush our favorite legends while they slay a massive beast. Bangalore is surprised to learn the truth behind Newcastle’s mysterious identity by the end of it all.\nSeason 13 “Saviors” might shift up the meta with the inclusion of Newcastle. While the terminology for the character’s abilities isn't clear, it’s safe to assume that he’ll keep his teammates safe with well-timed fortifications. According to speculation, he might even be able to drag downed allies out of the fight while reviving them. If this holds, then we’re in for significant changes in the casual and competitive levels of play. \nAre you excited about Season 13? What rank are you currently in for Season 12?

This announcement came by way of a rather odd tweet from the Nintendo of America account that seems to indicate the news comes straight from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself. \nThis is Miyamoto. After consulting with Chris-san, my partner at Illumination on the Super Mario Bros. film, we decided to move the global release to Spring 2023–April 28 in Japan and April 7 in North America. My deepest apologies but I promise it will be well worth the wait.\nApril 26, 2022\nThe Illumination Twitter account released the news at the same time last night with a similar message. \n“Miyamoto-san and I have been collaborating on all aspects of the Super Mario Bros. film and, together with our partners at Universal, have decided to move the global release to Spring 2023 – April 7 in North America and April 28 in Japan. We are excited to share this incredible film with you.” \nAs you can see, neither company lists a definitive reason for the delay, but it seems like the movie simply needed some additional time in the oven. Considering that this is Nintendo’s first significant foray into animated silver screen features and how big the Mario brand is, it makes sense to take all the time needed to make this movie the best it can be. \nReports from November of last year indicated that Nintendo was happy with the film thus far. Miyamoto reportedly even hinted that more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. While waiting to see if that becomes true, check out the complete cast list for this Super Mario Bros. film. \nAre you excited about this movie? Let us know in the comments below!",
