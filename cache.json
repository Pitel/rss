The first six Final Fantasy games on the NES and SNES – Final Fantasy I, II, III, IV, V, and VI – on a Nintendo console for the first time since Final Fantasy VI's release on the Wii Virtual Console in 2011 (or its inclusion on the SNES Mini in 2017)? Yes, please.\nOn the series’ big 35th anniversary, Square Enix gave us what we’ve been begging for about 18 months. To say some of these games are the most beloved entries in the series is a bit of an understatement – and Final Fantasy III’s NES version has never seen a proper official localisation.

          "description": "\"It's going well, but it's a big game\".\nIt has been a good long while since we last heard any updates on Haunted Chocolatier, the next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone. Fortunately, in a recent interview with Screen Rant, the creative sat down to provide some more news. Unfortunately, that news states that the game is still a way off.\nThe interview is mainly focused on Barone's work animating a music video for indie band Alvvays, although, as was bound to happen, the conversation eventually turned to the development of Haunted Chocolatier. In particular, Barone was quick to put to bed any notion that we will be getting our hands on the game any time soon, citing the \"daunting\" amount of work that comes with a game of this size:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We knew that Undertale creator Toby Fox had leapt back into the studio for a couple of tracks this time around and he has now confirmed precisely which tracks were his doing in his first newsletter.\nBack in August the game creator/composer announced that he had had worked on the Terastal Raid Battle music, but it turns out that there were actually another four tracks that he wrote for the games: 'Academy Ace Tournament', 'Battle! Zero Lab', 'Area Zero' (rearranged by Gō Ichinose) and the games' massive field theme.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Rest and relaxation and red panda.\nIt’s a tale as old as time: the hero defeats the enemies, then rides off into the sunset. But what happens next? In Aka, we find out. This open-world life sim comes from solo developer Cosmic Gatto, a pseudonym for a former DreamWorks animator. It follows the eponymous and adorable Aka, a red panda who is also a retired soldier. Aka may be soft and fluffy, but he’s the centre of something a little rough around the edges.\nThe game opens right at the end of ‘the great war’. Aka (Japanese for ‘red’) walks off the battlefield and takes a boat to Pine Tree Island to reunite with his best friend Thom and use his katana to cut wood rather than limbs. It’s the beginning of his new life. The island is a secluded slice of paradise where the grass grows wild and the neighbours include an array of characters who are colourful both inside and out. Here, Aka can spend his days tending to his farm and his neighbours’ needs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

What once began as a chance to see Mickey Mouse and a bloke with a trumpet walk along a street has since turned into a huge attraction of intricate floats, dance routines and *shivers* audience participation. Now, Universal Studios Japan is getting in on the hype and it's bringing Mario and various Pokémon along for the ride.\nWe have known for a while now that Pokémon would have some part to play in Universal Studios Japan, though we were unsure of what exactly this would entail. Well, it seems that the franchise will be one of the leading attractions in the park's upcoming 'No Limit Parade' which debuts on 1st March, 2023.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

What's most neat here is that one player uses their Switch in handheld mode whilst the other gets busy with their Joy-Cons in docked mode — using a required second Switch — in order to explore the world on offer, making sure that the console's gyro controls and touchscreen are all put to work as you push through the campaign.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. \nThe world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to \"challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,\" Dyankov tells me. \"Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.\" I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.\nRead more",

          "description": "I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).\nThe setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.\nRead more",

The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).\r\n\n\r\nA federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.\nHaving now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter.

The original article, based on test results taken before the hotfix, continues below:\n\r\nEarlier today we brought news that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update – a seemingly juicy serving of new ray tracing, DLSS/FSR upscaling, and assorted quality of life features – had in fact arrived in a bit of a mess. To assess the damage, I’ve spent some time with it myself, and can confirm: it ain’t great! Besides the devastating frames-per-second toll that the RT effects take, it seems far more crash-prone than I ever remember The Witcher 3 being in the past, and performance in general is just worse than it was pre-update.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The sequel to Sorath's exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you've dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. \r\n\n\r\nThat structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.\nSeveral of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.\nJames: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.\n Read more",

          "description": "When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix's somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game's most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).\nIt's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let's get into it.\nRead more",

According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly.

          "description": "Which game brings the most holiday cheer?\nSeasonal events in live service games are something I look forward to every year. Whether they're for the holiday season at the end of the year, or the best time of the year aka spooky season, it's always a good time to collect all the themed cosmetics and jump into a special game mode that will only be around for so long. These days, pretty much every live service game worth its salt has a holiday event to speak of, and with so many great ones out there (and a few that deserve a lump of coal), I had to do what we games journalists do — I had to rank them.\nSo here's my list of the live service holiday events of 2022. When it came to the games I chose, it came down to which titles I play, are intrigued by, or believe to generally have a big audience…",

          "description": "And the \"biggest 3rd Party Game Pass launch ever\"\nOver on the Game Pass charts (on both PC and console), I noticed that High on Life was jumping up quickly after launch. But today, Microsoft fully confirmed my inkling: the game is a bona fide success on Game Pass.\nThe Squanch Games release was apparently \"Xbox Game Pass’ biggest launch of 2022,\" as well as \"the biggest 3rd party Game Pass launch of all time, and the biggest release of a single player-only game in the service’s history.\" Where does Microsoft actually get those stats? They're based on the \"number of hours played in the first five days of release.\" In both an email to Destructoid and on the Xbox Wire blog itself, Microsoft uses the phrase \"millions of players\" to describe the userbase playing right now.\nDespite my misgivings with the game, as I pointed out in my review, High on Life might be the the most ideal Game Pass game to date (especially since it has a $60 MSRP). It's so janky that you'd possibly be pissed if you spent $60 on it, but on a lark as an \"extra\" on Game Pass, it's great to dive into with no context as patches roll out for it.\nNot only that, but given that so much of High on Life is based on Roiland's subjective sense of humor, you may not even enjoy the entire vibe altogether. While many of those jokes are hit or miss, one of the best things about it is the \"90s adventure game\" feeling it has, Easter eggs and meta-references and all. I wish it had a bit more polish, but it's great to see Squanch Games getting a win either way.\nThe post Microsoft says High on Life is 2022’s biggest Game Pass launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just Deserts\nBandai Namco has offered up a little more information on its previously teased \"Project Sand Land\" endeavor, focusing on the short-lived but well-received manga by Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama.\nAccording to the publisher, Project Sand Land consists of several creative endeavors, produced by a variety of well-known manga, anime, and game producers. The first and foremost of these tributes will be a full \"visual adaptation\" of the original 2000 manga series. This cinematic project will be produced by veteran anime studios Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga, and ANIMA, and is scheduled to premiere in 2023. Bandai Namco's insistence on referring to the production as a \"visual adaptation\" rather than a \"film\" or an \"anime\" leaves a few questions up in the air. but we'll just have to wait and see.\nYou can check out a teaser trailer for the adaptation below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--plyeEv4Ag&t=53s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nAs we previously recanted, Sand Land was dystopian adventure series set within a world that had become almost entirely desert, with water becoming the single most important form of currency. With his local town dry as a bone, aging sheriff Rao teams up with Prince of Demons Beelzebub (no, really), and impish mischief maker Thief on an odyssey to uncover the location of the legendary Phantom Lake and return a source of hydration to his hometown.\nWhile the visual adaptation is the only endeavor revealed by Bandai Namco so far, the publisher suggests that it has other creative projects in the works, with more reveals to be made across 2023, given the studio's interest, it's not hard to imagine that there may be a Sand Land video game in the works. For now, we're just going to have to hold fast and keep our tanks gassed up and ready to rock.\nIn the meantime, you can check out the official Project Sand Land website right here.\nThe post Project Sand Land is a ‘visual adaptation’ of the cult Toriyama manga appeared first on Destructoid.",

After all, various '90s classics have been resurrected time and again, only to fall short of their former glories or, in the worst cases, miss the point entirely.\nBut Live A Live was something different. Live A Live, launched in 1994 at the tail-end of the 16-bit reign, was both ambitious and way ahead of its time.

Developer Sloclap is bringing Sifu to Xbox and Steam in March 2023, as well as a new Arenas mode.\nUp to this point, Sifu has been available on PlayStation consoles, PC via Epic, and the Nintendo Switch. When it arrives on Xbox and Steam, it'll go for $39.99. That will include the free updates the game has received in the time since launch, including the recent fall update with a Replay Editor and the upcoming Arenas mode update.\nArenas mode, which will be part of a free update this spring, will add nine new maps with special challenges. Completing the arena challenges will unlock new modifiers, as well as add some alternative moves to the protagonist's arsenal. It's always nice to have some extra tricks up your sleeve when enacting your vengeance, right? The Arenas will also unlock new cheats and special new outfits, too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW_4aIEV3Q\nOn a quest for revenge\nSifu was one of the earlier hits of 2022, arriving just at the start of February. Following a martial arts student whose master is slain by a rival organization. As the student, you go on a quest for vengeance, fueled by a magical artifact that lets you spring back to life at the cost of years of your life.\nIt's a really fun brawler, and fitting follow-up to Sloclap's previous game Absolver. With the new updates, it seems like a lot has been added to freshen up the experience, and a special Arenas mode is a no-brainer for Sifu. Looks like there will be a good reason to get back into the brawl next year.\nThe post Sifu heads to Xbox, Steam, and gets an Arenas mode next March appeared first on Destructoid.",

This holiday update is a little less exciting, but it does involve a nearly-free skin.\nBlizzard has announced today that the Legendary Gingerbread Bastion skin will cost one Overwatch 2 coin (the main currency of the new iteration of the game). The promotion will run from today through January 3. You can check out the skin in the header image, and see if it's even worth your time logging in (or installing it at all, depending on your reaction to the semi-sequel).\nI guess it's a good thing Bastion was fixed\nYou may recall that late in the year, Bastion was busted, and was taken out of the rotation completely. As a recap, Blizzard posted the following Twitter message on October 10: \"Bastion and Torbjörn will be taking a quick trip to the workshop while we iron out a few bugs in their ability kits! Bastion will be unavailable in all modes during this time, while Torbjörn will still be playable in Quick Play.\" Bastion in particular was able to exploit his ultimate, leading to a swift recall of the hero.\nBastion was added back to the game on October 25, and joins a line of heroes (among other things like at least one map) that were removed from the game due to bugs.\nThe post You can get this nearly-free Legendary Gingerbread Bastion skin in Overwatch 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Two more shadowdrops have arrived, as well as two announcements of upcoming games slated for 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qXjO6eQm34\nFirst up, the play-it-now games for today. The Captain is a new narrative adventure from Sysiac Games and Tomorrow Corporation. You play a lost science officer from the space fleet, trying to work their way back home with some precious info. Lots of choices wait to be made, as well as big space battles to get caught up in.\nIf penguins are more your style, The Punchuin is a new game from The Touryst team Shin'en. You play as a penguin who punches things, and is trying to see all there is to see on Punch Mountain. It's part match-three puzzle, and part-charming exploration and adventure, but all punchy penguin.\nForecast calls for more rain\nTwo more games got revealed today too, locking in for a 2023 launch window. The first is The Gecko Gods, a puzzle platformer from Inresin and Super Rare Originals. It asks, \"what if a gecko could explore a mysterious and dangerous island?\" It's all in the pursuit of saving their friend, who I hope is also a small and adorable gecko. That's set to arrive in 2023.\nA popular roguelike is also on the way back, too. Risk of Rain Returns is a remastered version of the original Risk of Rain from Hopoo Games and Gearbox Publishing. It looks to have all the 2D chaos of the original, but with a new coat of paint and apparently new ways to play in store too. The rain returns in 2023.\nThere are still three days left this week in Nintendo's House of Indies advent calendar.

Camera in hand, the player simply strolls around towns, beaches, and cityscapes, getting snap-happy on any and all four-legged friends that cross their path.

And, when not taking great photos, you can pet your new doggie pals, play fetch, dress them up (if you're terrible), arrange parties, and enjoy various other activities. Don't forget to take them *checks notes* skateboarding. As you receive acclaim for your pupperazzi skills, you'll also get the opportunity to upgrade your camera equipment — buying new filters, lenses, and effects. It's all very charming and wholesome, and most certainly a stress-free way to unwind on a lazy afternoon.\nPupperazzi launches in early 2023 on Nintendo Switch.

I assume some of you out there are gifting hardware to relatives or immediate family members, and with modern hardware comes a certain degree of responsibility. Yep, updates! This Reddit thread from Letmeplat reminded me of something really important: consider updating your hardware before you gift it.\nOften times, Christmas day servers explode with demand\nI think it was the 3DS era that I started thinking about updating gifts ahead of time. It had gotten to the point where nearly everything needed a hefty amount of firmware updates: on top of game updates. I think the worst experience I've ever had with this was updating my PS3 after a long hiatus. The PSN would take hours to download each update, and would turn around and download an update on top of that update. It was exhausting, and would just leave it running all day.\nAs an extra tip: if your console comes with a free game like Mario Kart, consider updating that too. Or as a matter of fact, consider updating any game you're gifting. With few exceptions (like The Witcher 3 fitting on one Switch cart), many games require huge updates to even play, which could mean wait times, or bugged out servers preventing someone from downloading a crucial day one patch.\nOf course, you could also leave it to the giftee to do it, especially if you're aiming to give them a sealed copy. It's your choice!\nThe post PSA: If you’re gifting gaming hardware for Christmas, think about updating it first appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thank you for spending your time with us and we hope you will join us in one of our many other games.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KETsS3nkwBw&ab_channel=IGN\nThe in-game store is closed, effective immediately, and players are encouraged to use up any of the \"Purple Crystals\", (On the Run's in-game currency), before the closing date. The news has come as something of a surprise to some in the runner's community, as there had been whispers that On the Run! might actually have been preparing for a full relaunch in the new year. The game had previously been delisted from stores, with the developer saying that the removal was due to a \"bug\".\nDedicated fans of the title have also expressed dismay that a game they have spent money on over the past 23 months will suddenly be rendered completely unusable. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the risk that comes with frequent spending within modern service titles.

          "description": "Chaotic scenes from Capcom TV\nEarly this morning, Capcom held its latest Capcom TV live stream, in which we got our first proper glimpse at some new Street Fighter 6 characters in action. Clumsily strutting their stuff for the home audience were newcomers Marisa, Manon, and J.P. who joined series veterans Dhalsim, Dee Jay, and E. Honda for some impromptu slugfests.\nNow, without being mean, it must be said that these matches are hardly what you'd call \"deep dive character showcases\" — featuring a helluva lot of wild button mashing and endless jumping — but the matches do give us the opportunity to check out some of the incoming characters normals and specials, along with their respective intro animations, walkouts, win poses, and, perhaps most importantly of all, their \"Game Face\" options!\n…",

If that sounds like you, make sure to check out Humble Bundle's insane end of year sale, because they have some seriously awesome stuff on there. They have hundreds of games and DLC marked down, including fan favorites like God of War, Hollow Knight, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, Dying Light 2, Signalis, Deathloop, and Psychonauts 2, just to name a few.\nThe discounts range anywhere from 10% to 75% off, and I can say as a fan that I was very pleasantly surprised to see some of these games at such low prices. For example, they have Slime Rancher for $5 right now! One of my all-time favorite and most played games Slay the Spire is under $10. You could buy like four games for $20 and be good for the next month or two -- that's pretty good if you ask me.\n\nHonestly Humble Bundle has been one of my favorite ways to buy new titles as a baby gamer -- considering I don't usually need to play the newest titles as they drop because I'm still trying to catch up on the best games from like four or five years ago, I find that they always have a great sale going on for something in my backlog.\nNot only do they have cool sales and pre-packaged bundles of games you can get, but Humble Bundle is also known for using their sales to support all kinds of amazing charities like Charity: Water, Girls Who Code, and One Tree Planted, among others. Since the site's founding back in 2010, they've managed to raise over $200,000,000 for charity through their sales and monthly subscription. They also further spread the love by featuring a different charity on their site each month.\n \nThe post Don’t miss Humble Bundle’s huge end of year sale appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Inside the House of Indies Holiday Event starts today and runs through this Friday, highlighting new and upcoming indie games headed for the Nintendo Switch.\nEach day of this week, Nintendo will upload a new video at 9 a.m. PT. Each one will shine a light on updates, announcements, and news from Nintendo's indie partners.\nFor a good example of what to expect, today's Day 1 spotlight features two new games and two upcoming launches. First up are Floppy Knights, a deckbuilding tactics game with a very charming art style, and Mortal Shell, a grim Souls-alike, both making their way to Nintendo Switch today.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMjdUHrjYLs\nThose two are out now, but two more games were revealed for the Switch's future slate. One is a port of Pupperazzi, the adorable photo sim game about taking pictures of pups around town, arriving in early 2023. The other is a new game from Paratopic creators Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build. Set in a decrepit facility as the world ends, it has quite the laundry list of genres, including visual novel, adventure, puzzle solving, horror, and survival simulation. Sounds right up my alley.\nA holiday of indies\nThat's just day one for the House of Indies. But Nintendo has four more days of news lined up, running now through December 23. There's still quite a bit more to reveal, and at least anticipated game that's had a December window already set.\nWhile it's a bit different from an Indie World Showcase or something, I kind of dig this model. Games get their own day to thrive, and each new video can be a little surprise. With lots of travel and holiday time in the near-future, I imagine a couple indie games to while away the hours are a welcome surprise-drop for Switch owners too.\nThe post Nintendo is hosting a House of Indies holiday event throughout this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The results? Lots of new Charmanders to give out! Here's how to breed one and evolve it.\n\nUse the standard egg hatching method with Ditto and your Tera Raid Charizard\nThere's nothing really new here that you need to do: just use the same egg hatching method, but have Ditto and your raid Charizard in your party.\nStart a picnic, and if you want, eat an egg-based sandwich to increase the rate in which eggs trigger. After some time passes at your picnic with the aforementioned parameters, walk over to the basket on the other side of the picnic table, and see if there's an egg in there (there could be multiple!).\nIf you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here.\n\nCharmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16, and Charizard at level 36\nAfter hatching, the default Charmander will have the scratch and growl moves as a level 1 Pokemon.

This is the exact same scheme as the Charizard raid events, but there's a little more leeway here to finish up the requirements (which includes not only finishing the base game, but some postgame as well).\nAs a reminder, you'll only be able to catch this particular raid-based Pokemon once per save file, and it will be a fighting tera type: with the mightiest mark (again, similar to Charizard). It will also likely follow suit with Charizard in that it will not be part of the Paldea Pokedex.\nThe first Scarlet & Violet Cinderace Tera Raid battle event will start on December 30\nClear out your schedule if you really want Cinderace, as you'll need to do some prep before December 30 rolls around. To unlock the ability to play against 7 star raids, you'll need to complete the story, finish all of the gyms again in the postgame, then clear the Mesagoza tournament. After that, you'll want to seek out 10 five star raids (you need to host them/find them yourself on the map): then you can unlock 6 and 7 star raids.\nWe have a full guide here for getting ready for 7 star raids.\nHere are the full dates for each event:\nDecember 30, 2022 -January 1, 2023\nJanuary 13, 2022 - January 15, 2023\nThe post PSA: A Cinderace Tera Raid battle is coming to Pokémon Scarlet & Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spectator mode, replays, online stability and more\nEarlier this month, publisher 3goo released the 2005 2D fighting title The Rumble Fish 2 onto modern consoles, offering the unique scrapper its first worldwide home release ever. Unfortunately, despite the quality of the game itself, the release was a woefully disappointing way to present this long-lost classic.\nThe new release of Rumble Fish 2 forces 16x9 widescreen support, has a soft filter by default, does not support keyboard for its Steam release, and is missing rudimentary fighting game features for its online modes, such as lobbies, a replay function, and even the ability to rematch your opponent. Additionally, The Rumble Fish 2 is priced at $30, and locks three characters behind an additional $10 paywall. Yikes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtrhFxv-2WA&ab_channel=3goo\nFollowing a slew of negative feedback directed toward The Rumble Fish 2 on Steam, a developer has responded to the \"Top Review\", suggesting that an update is incoming. The update is aiming to add some of the requested features, including savable replays, a spectator mode, additional practice mode settings, and more. A separate update also rolled out on all platforms today, which fixes several unspecified issues with the game's online and offline modes.\nIt's a big positive to see 3goo address some of the issues with this disappointing release. A 4x3 option would be essential, as dedicated players are discovering that the forced 16x9 ratio is, incredibly, causing some wall-bounce combos to break. Additionally, the locked DLC characters should be addressed, whether the publisher caves and offers the trio to all players, or simply reduces the retail price of the base game. There is still much to do to make The Rumble Fish 2 an appealing release, but this update is a start.\nThe Rumble Fish 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post The Rumble Fish 2 looks to add key features with incoming update appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one too!\nFrom the mind of reggtegg over on Reddit, this working Switch dock recreates the aesthetic of Generation 4: aka the Sinnoh region from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. The design looks big, but it's functional, and perfectly replicates the look of the Pokecenter from that series of games. Man, I miss those escalators.\nIf you're interested, here is their Etsy store. They mention that they will be \"releasing this as an item in the next week or so.\" It'll be using a Polymaker Terra filament for a \"cool matte texture.\"\nSinnoh is making a comeback\nTruth be told, Sinnoh was the first region where I missed out on playing a new generational Pokemon game day one. I had a lot going on in my life in 2007, and most of my Pokemon-playing friends went to other colleges, or fell out of love with the series. It wasn't until I started playing with my wife that I really had an excuse to get back into it in earnest, and my fondness for the franchise was rekindled.\nNow Sinnoh is back for real with Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in the mix, keeping the region alive for a new generation of players.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"354856,354855\"]\nThe post This fan made Sinnoh Pokecenter Switch dock is lovely appeared first on Destructoid.",

Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.\nAnnounced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel's 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. \n\n\nIn a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. \nRisk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC.

If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.\n\n\nThe Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.\nSometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.\nSo this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset?

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…",

When asked if there's a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. \n\n\n\"I personally can't conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,\" Kamiya told IGN Japan. \"I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.\"\nKamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks \"internally about how we could make nine of them.\" He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, \"I'm not going to do anything that will betray the players.\" \nWhile not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review. \n[Source: IGN Japan]\nDo you believe Platinum Games will make as many Bayonetta games as Kamiya would like?

A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. \nWatch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: \n\n\nThe Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it's been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an \"expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,\" according to a press release from earlier this year. \nThe Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.\nCrash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.\n\"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,\" Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. \"Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities.\"\nYou can see the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nCrash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won't need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.",

While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.\n\n\nIn the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.\nOutside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.

Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
