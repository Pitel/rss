Continuing the storyline from the classic 1992 platform shooter, this follow-up was first teased back in 2021 for a release the following year, before having its launch pushed back to some point in 2023. Publisher Microids has today announced that the game will be heading our way this November, and we even have a flashy new gameplay trailer to get us in the mood.\nThe 2022 teaser didn't do all that much to show what this sequel was going to be all about, and fortunately, that is remedied by the latest promo. We can get a closer look at the 3D upgrades that have been made to the series' environments by original dev Paul Cuisset, see some of the shooter combat in action and get a better idea of Conrad B. Hart's new design (much less pixel-y, huh?).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Balls well that ends well.\nThere’s an approach to relationship counselling where there’s a ball, and whoever is holding the ball gets to speak. Having said your piece, you toss the ball to another person and they get their chance to express themselves without interruption. But here’s an idea: what if you just threw the ball as hard as you could at the other person’s face? Okay, let’s tone it down a little: a friendly game of dodgeball in the safe space of a dream. Add a roguelike twist of turn-based, team-based strategy and you have Desta: The Memories Between.\nDesta is the latest offering from Ustwo Games, creators of, among other things, 2014 mobile hit Monument Valley and 2021’s peaceful camera-and-scrapbook game Alba: A Wildlife Adventure. Originally launching in 2022 as a Netflix game and now arriving on Switch in an enhanced and expanded form (although minus touch support), it tells the story of Desta, who is returning to the family home in preparation for it to be sold. Desta lost their father sometime before and didn’t leave things in a positive place with their mum. The anxiety about facing their mother needs to be unpicked in a dream space, letting an imagined conversation play out so that Desta can face the real-life situation constructively. However, the journey to that conversation is full of old friends, and it turns out Desta didn’t leave things sitting tidily with any of them when they went away. Exploring your feelings in dream dodgeball, you must work through tricky conversations compassionately, all while enjoying a bit of semi-violent sport.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?\nWell, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.\nRead more",

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a third-person action game where you play Cal Kestis in his second rip-roaring adventure across a localised part of the galaxy, fighting both the Empire and a very naughty little Sith, with a flanking attack from Cal's own regrets about getting people killed all the time. Crucially though, at least for the purposes of having fun, Cal has one of those hot glowsticks that goes *whummmmm* and cute robot friend BD-1 - but you will often be deploying both in the effort to get a new pair of trousers.\nRead more",

It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys.

          "description": "For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. \nWhether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.\nRead more",

Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.\nFor fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes.

A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.\nMy aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general.

If you're used to heavier fare this may still scratch the itch.\nIt's not that it's particularly simple, but it feels so damn clean and effortless to play. You'll know what you're doing in minutes, but still find a decent challenge, with lots of options but minimal analysis paralysis. I'm honestly finding it hard to fault.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its success validated Bethesda’s decision to buy Arkane a couple of years earlier, and left the publisher with a promising new series. But despite critical acclaim, Dishonored 2 failed to bring the series to a wider audience. And after 2017’s standalone expansion, Death Of The Outsider, Bethesda decided to put the series on pause in favour of a shorter, more experimental project - according to Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio, who spoke to me in an interview about their cancelled project The Crossing.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.\nRead more",

I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

          "description": "In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that \"really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy\".  \nBut in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.\nRead more",

If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.\r\n\n\r\nDead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A crashing issue with Life is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.\nDownloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done.

A new audience can now experience one of PlayStation’s best exclusives, but even better, modders can get their hands on Joel and Ellie’s trek, rejigging a familiar story in new ways. There aren’t too many exciting ones available to download just yet, but one “in-progress” mod reimagines the game in first-person, and it’s stunning.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. \nBut actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list. \nRead more",

The short version: with maximum read and write speeds that tower over the current generation’s best SSDs, albeit with less impact on game load times than such explosive pace would suggest.\nRead more",

Ne-konference neznamená, že se organizátorům nechce připravovat program, ale naopak dává prostor všem pozvaným, aby si program sami složili z toho nejzajímavějšího, čím se v poslední době zabývají nebo co je oslovilo. Obsah, který vytváří všichni účastníci, se skládá z desetiminutových prezentací a delších workshopů s převážně vývojářskou tematikou od devops, přes datové struktury, nástroje, jazyky, zkušenosti s automatizací testů a různé zajímavosti ze světa IT. Co je potřeba udělat, abyste se mohli zúčastnit? Připravit si desetiminutovou prezentaci na libovolné téma, která má potenciál oslovit ostatní přítomné. Historicky proběhlo i několik velmi zajímavých nevývojářských témat, takže ani výletu do úplně jiného oboru není třeba se nikterak bránit.",

World of Warcraft eventually added this as a quality-of-life feature over time, and thankfully, Diablo IV will be going in that same direction; so long as you finish the campaign once.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQtOIeKRXaY\nBlizzard showed off, then confirmed, a \"skip campaign\" button for alts\nJust this week, Blizzard put out a new video for Diablo IV titled \"Inside the Game: Your Class Your Way.\" The main intent was to show off how customizable the game was from top to bottom (including character creation examples and transmog options); but eagle-eyed viewers saw a special button during the showcase.\nSo the button in question comes up at 2:50 in the above video. Take a look at the right side of the character select screen, below the World Tier section. You'll see a \"skip campaign\" option right there.\n[caption id=\"attachment_375691\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Blizzard[/caption]\nThe button was spotted by Twitter user DatModz, and Diablo Blizard Global Community Development Director Adam Fletcher stepped in to provide some extra context. Fletcher noted in a reply tweet that you \"gotta beat the campaign once for this,\" dispelling the notion of being able to just \"skip the campaign altogether.\" It was fairly obvious, but confirmation is confirmation!\nThe idea of skipping the campaign outright was already debunked in the video itself, as the first character shown in that same section of the video (a Barbarian) did not have the \"skip campaign\" option.\nThe post Confirmed: Diablo IV will have a skip campaign button appeared first on Destructoid.",

What seemed like a novel concept on the surface turned out to have a lot of beef underneath. Centering a horror game around cooking is engrossing enough, but it then gets tied up in interesting ways and dunked into an unconventional world full of mystery and horror. The narrative tells the story of trying to escape from an obvious simulation, but the world in which this simulation exists is an entity worth exploring on its own.\nImmediately after stepping into the game, you’re hit from all sides with flavor lore.

Video games have long emulated books and movies to tell their tales, both of which directly rip all control out of your hands and force you to sit and watch or, ugh, read. Part of Half-Life’s appeal in 1998 was that it didn’t do that. It let you experience the story without taking it away from you.\nAnd for a lot of games, that was far enough. As long as you could poke at the microwave while someone spoke to you, that was interactive storytelling. Never mind that you could tell it just as easily in film.\nPart of the issue is that players have a hard time sitting still when there are things to kill.

Currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, the release will include some titles which are receiving their first-ever official localization.\n\nIrem Collection Volume 1 — the first of what is set to be a five-volume set — will feature three titles in total. They are Image Fight (1988), Image Fight II: Operation Deepstriker (1992), and the iconic bio-blaster XMultiply (1992). These three vertically scrolling shmups were all smash hits during the renaissance of the arcade scene, and were among the tidal wave of titles that helped to keep the genre alive as gaming headed into the 1990s.\nIn addition to the digital release, ININ Games will release a physical edition of Irem Collection Volume 1, (and, presumably, its following four volumes). This set, available for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, includes a hard copy of the game, a visual compendium, replica arcade flyers, a double-disc CD soundtrack, replica boxes for Image Fight and Image Fight 2's home releases, as well as some cool, A2 sized posters for all three titles.

Sony has revealed its PlayStation Plus May lineup, which features some extreme sports and chivalric endeavors.\nMay 2023's PlayStation Plus lineup is led by GRID Legends, a racing game with some story to it. Via the PlayStation blog, GRID Legends has a cast that includes Ncuti Gatwa (Sex Education) and follows the race-track drama of the racing world.\nOr maybe you want a different kind of sport, and turn instead toward Descenders, where you can challenge procedurally generated hills on a bike. Nail sick tricks and earn new looks as you try to stay upright on the downhill slopes.\nOf course, you could also just brawl it out in Chivalry 2, the medieval warfare simulator full of grisly, rewarding swordfights. I played a bit of this on PC a while ago, and had a good time with it. It's the right mix of surprisingly intricate combat and absolutely goofy moments.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1651247336843014146\nIt's a pretty alright lineup, in my opinion. It hits that sweet spot of games I might not have sought out personally, but I'm open to giving them a shot if it doesn't cost me much. Keep in mind that last month's games—Meet Your Maker, Sackboy: A Big Adventure, and Tails of Iron—leave the PS Plus lineup on May 1.\nBuilding out Plus\nThese are the selections available for all tiers of PlayStation Plus. Meanwhile, the higher tier selections for PS Plus specifically for the Extra and Premium levels, tend to get announced later on in the month.\nWe'll see what that holds, though we do know that Humanity will be among the Game Catalog offerings in PlayStation Plus for May.\nThe post May’s PlayStation Plus games have knights, bikes, and cars appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a frenetic running battle that can turn on a dime, and requires strong synergy, efficient movement, and, as always, a precise aim. Warzone players will no doubt be pleased to see the challenging side-game return.\nIn addition to Plunder's comeback, Infinity Ward has released an update to both Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare 2 proper, featuring an array of bug fixes pertaining mostly to errors in the U.I. and HUD systems. In regards to CoD gameplay itself, the new patch adds more ammo caches to the Zaya Observatory in multiplayer map Ground War, and reduces the number of available lasers for the arsenal-running Gunfight mode.

Limited Run Games seems willing to sacrifice this horrible entropy by bringing us a collection of “classic” Jurassic Park titles. They've teased us with The Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary Retro Collection, but we'll have to wait until June to get more info.\nThe bad news is that only the titles developed by Ocean are teased. The good news is they’re not all bad, and the SNES version is among them.\nhttps://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1650961515405537288?s=20\nI’ve spent more time than I ever imagined talking about the 1993 SNES version of Jurassic Park. It isn’t great and has many problems, but you can tell the developers had serious passion for the project. It uses ray-casting to create first-person indoor environments the same year Doom came out, and there are several small touches that give it life.\nI can’t really speak for the rest of the games. The NES and Game Boy versions of the first title are extremely similar. Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues is different on SNES and Game Boy. They’re side-scrollers, and despite the title, they’re not really sequels in terms of style or mechanics. I own the SNES version but haven’t played it for more than a few minutes. It’s very difficult to get over the disappointment of it not being a continuation of the previous SNES title.\nBeyond the tease and the promise that they’ll announce more in June, Limited Run is being tight-lipped on what they intend to do with these titles. They say it will be The Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary Retro Collection, but will it be reproductions of these titles or a release on current consoles?

The sequel will feature characters, mechanics, and locales familiar to fans of the groundbreaking original, while introducing all new elements such as Conrad's powerful new A.I. firearm, A.I.S.H.A.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-arkUwWxs8&ab_channel=Microids\nAs you can see from the gameplay trailer, Flashback 2 is taking something of a 2.5D approach to its platform-based, run 'n' gun action, featuring all the of ledge scaling, dodge-rolling, abyss-leaping excitement of the original, while affording combat new depth through the use of cover systems and the ability to move and shoot both into and out of the geometric plane. Interestingly, the game this footage reminds me of the most is Epic's great 2009 release Shadow Complex, and while Flashback 2 is most certainly set to be something of a modest production and release, this early trailer has promise.\n\nMicroids also revealed that it will be releasing a physical edition of the new sequel, which will include a physical copy of Flashback 2 on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch, a soundtrack CD, sticker sheets, a pin featuring the original Conrad Hart sprite, a digital copy of the 1992 release, steelbook casing, and an 8-inch figurine of our amnesiac star himself.

Additionally, the demo includes limited versions of the standard \"Fighting Ground\" modes, including Vs. battles, the bull-charging Extreme Battle, and a glimpse at the new Tutorial mode.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JmxWphGO5Y&ab_channel=StreetFighter\nPlayers can also check out both the Classic and Modern control schemes, the latter of which offers a simpler input system for both newer and younger players. The roster for the Fighting Ground modes is locked to just Ryu and Luke, but they're both solid characters and great for getting to grips with the new systems, including Drive Impact, Drive Rush, and Drive Parry. You should also check out the Level 8 difficulty setting, which is currently raising even pro-player eyebrows with its inherent ruthlessness.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

          "description": "Their name was Pizza!?\nPurveyor of video game merch, Fangamer, has released a plush of the protagonist of 2021’s Chicory: A Colorful Tale. And, oh my gosh, just look at it.\nDesigned by Alexis Dean-Jones and Audrey Waner, this Pizza plush is 8” tall. It comes with a magnetic paintbrush that attaches to their hand and includes a set of washable markers so you can draw on them. It's a rather cute nod to the game, where you could draw on anything in the game world, and even paint your character to customize them.\nChicory: A Colorful Tale was Destructoid’s 2021 Game of the Year. I personally handled the review of it, and if I’m not mistaken, it still is my highest scored game at a 9.5. I really connected with the themes of depression, anxiety, and imposter syndrome. It hit hard during one of the most difficult times of my life, and helped me gain confidence when I was just starting to get my feet on the ground at Destructoid.\nI completely forgot the protagonist has the default name of Pizza. It asks you to enter your favorite food at the start of the game, so I named my hero Tacos. I at least remembered they weren’t named Chicory, because that’s the name of the burnt-out bunny who helps you along. I really relate to that bunny.\nDamn, that was a good game.\nThe Pizza plush from Chicory: A Colorful Tale is available now at Fangamer for $32 USD.\nThe post Fangamer has an adorable Chicory plush that you can draw on appeared first on Destructoid.",

As such, there is quite the roster to choose from when putting together each new sequel, and while Tekken 8 is already filling up the ranks with fan favorites such as Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, Lili Rochefort, King, and Leroy Smith, there are still many familiar faces, old and new, unaccounted for.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p07h8qIsUd4\nMy main squeeze, Lili, has already made the cut, and she's frankly the only Tekken character I have any real degree of competency with. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't also like to see characters such as Master Raven, Lidia Sobieska, and Anna Williams (imagine those fashions in Unreal 5) join the party. And, of course, there's always room for one of the franchise's finest creations, The Absolute Menace, Lucky Chloe.\nBut let's hear from you in our beloved community, who are you eagerly hoping will step back into the ring, the lab, and the bowling alley this time around? Are you waiting on a classic such as Julia Chang or Lei WuLong, an oddity such as Mokujin or Dr. Boskonovitch, or even one of the latter-day stars such as Katarina Alves or Fahkumram? Whoever you wanna see, tell us all about it!\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Although Nintendo gave us the \"final\" trailer for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom recently, we now have this extra \"You Can Do What?\" ad to peruse and glean more info from before its May 12, 2023 release.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUcBlvw0LSk\nLike many other Nintendo ads, the crux is showcasing people playing Zelda together, despite the single player focus. Through several scripted sequences, Nintendo shows off some more potential for the game's core mechanics, including Fusion and Ascend. One player creates an air ship, and another player attempts to cross an aerial track with a makeshift minecart. We also get full confirmation of the Flame Gleeok boss 20 seconds in.\nOnce we're at the 50-second mark everything flows back to that recent trailer footage: but there's some good stuff up through that point. To be frank this is one of the more revealing ads in recent memory, especially for a game as shrouded in mystery as Tears of the Kingdom currently is pre-launch.

          "description": "Worthwhile-est game award\nLast time at the Destructoid Institute of Critiquing Kusoge, I looked at Castlevania for the N64. We’ve established that the Castlevania series has never been very good when it comes to its 3D titles, but the N64 games are likely the most worthwhile.\nThe second title on the N64, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, is easily the worthwhile-est. That’s mostly because it’s essentially an apology for Castlevania 64. Love it or hate it, it’s hard to deny that Castlevania 64 had the signs of rushed development. This wasn’t anything overly major – most of its glaring problems today aren’t atypical for the time period it was released – but it comes down to a lack of polish. More notably, but less noticeably, Konami cut two characters of the planned four.\nLegacy of Darkness r…",

          "description": "That’s a lot of hexagons\nCamlann Games has given us a little peek at Code::Arts’ upcoming 4X civilization builder, BoC: Birth of Cultures. While the “teaser” doesn’t show much of the meat in Birth of Cultures’ stew, it does portray its scale.\nBoC: Birth of Cultures features a world map that is “more than” 491,000 hex tiles in size. I’m no math person, but by my calculations, that’s a lot of tiles. For perspective, the largest map size in Civilization VI is 6,996 tiles. The map is apparently based on “realistic simulations.” Rather than using traditional fog of war, Birth of Cultures instead utilizes the planet’s natural curvature to limit what you can see. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole flat/round shape of the earth is still under heated debate.\nhttps://youtu.be/tBmAIsq0eKg\nOn this large playfield, you’ll be overseeing the growth of a civilization starting from the ice age. You start as a nomadic tribe and progress through 60,000 years of development. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole length of human history is still under heated debate.\nThe announcement highlights the size of the playfield and the effects of terrain and climate. However, Birth of Cultures promises a dynamic progression system and features a “sandbox-like combination of progression and cultures.” I’m not entirely sure what that means, but I’m going to assume it’s a bold stance on something.\nBoC: Birth of Cultures remains exclusive to PC via Steam for now. It is set to release into Early Access later in 2023.\nThe post Gigantic 4X strategy game BoC: Birth of Cultures coming later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today.

          "description": "Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. \nThis news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.\n\n\nAlong with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.",

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here. \nAre you checking out Oxenfree II: Lost Signals this summer?

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023.

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

          "description": "Months before the premiere of the very successful Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Paramount announced plans to create a live-action spin-off TV show starring Knuckles. After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. \nSonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer. \n#knuckles pic.twitter.com/Hr4zNjuLuj\nApril 17, 2023\nThe show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).\nPlot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior. \nAre you looking forward to the Knuckles series? Let us know in the comments!",

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. \nIn a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: \n“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  \nIt was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”\nSo there you have it.

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.",

Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay?

While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
