          "description": "The torture continues...\nIf you managed to catch the Microsoft and Bethesda Games Showcase 2022, then you'll know that Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal will be making their way to Xbox consoles and Game Pass. It was a blow for Switch owners hoping for the series to be ported onto Nintendo's console and now it looks like all three games are also coming to PlayStation 5 and Steam.\nGiven that rumours have been swirling of the Persona games coming to the Switch for quite some time at this point, it genuinely feels like we're the last one to be picked for the sports team right now. What gives? Granted, there's still time for the games to be announced for Switch (Nintendo Direct soon, anyone?), and their arrival on Xbox platforms signifies an openness from Atlus to finally go cross-platform with the core series, but we can't help but feel a tad left out.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Devilishly good.\nThough the manga only started in 2016, Demon Slayer has gone on to become one of the most successful media franchises in existence—even passing up the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog and Minecraft in raw sales. Despite this, Demon Slayer has had shockingly little presence in video games; aside from a Japan-only mobile game that still has yet to release, the only other game is Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles. This release came to other platforms just this past fall, and now the Switch version has come with all the post-launch DLC from those releases. Though it has some flaws, we found Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles to be thoroughly enjoyable and we think you should consider giving it a shot.\nThe story of Demon Slayer follows Tanjiro, a young man with an axe to grind with demonkind. Prior to the events of the game, a demon attacked and killed his family while he was away—one sister survived, but she didn’t get much of a better deal given that she was turned into a ferocious demon. We take on the role of Tanjiro just as he’s about to complete the final step of his training to become a proper Demon Slayer. Once he’s done so, his goal is then to avenge his family’s death by killing the demon who murdered them and hopefully to find a cure for his sister somewhere along the way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Heck, you only need to play Undertale for 5 minutes to see the similarities! Fox's love for the Mother games goes all the way back to his high school days, during which he created ROM hacks such as Earthbound: The Halloween Hack.\nGiven his adoration of the Mother series, Fox naturally had aspirations of contributing to a potential new game, and even toyed with the idea of asking its creator, Shigesato Itoi, about whether or not he wanted to see a new game come to fruition. Ultimately, after hearing what Ito had to say on the success of Undertale, Fox chose not to bring the subject up.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.\nNow, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.\nRead more",

          "description": "We finally glimpsed our first look at some in-game footage from interstellar RPG Starfield at yesterday’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, and it had the feel of a less retro Fallout 4. Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill.

Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it.

One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an \"Indigenous cybernoir detective game\" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe \"in the works\" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.\nThe trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with \"crime, conflict, and propaganda\". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.\nRead more",

I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.\nRead more",

Not a chance. I wouldn't like it.\" People were shocked at my refusal. \"But nothing will go wrong!\" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.\nHonestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.\nRead more",

Next on the list is Capcom, and with Street Fighter 6 and Resident Evil 4 on the way, it's easy to be stoked. The Capcom Showcase begins at 3:00 p.m. Pacific today and will last \"roughly 35 minutes.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48j01h_IGg\nCapcom says the showcase will cover \"details and news on previously announced titles.\"\nFurther keeping expectations in check, the company specifically mentioned the stream will focus on upcoming games like Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Exoprimal, and Resident Evil 4. Anything else could just be a bonus — but don't let that stop you from hoping for more.\nI know Moyse wants to see another Street Fighter 6 character trailer before the team steps out of the spotlight for a bit, and I'm hoping to hear concrete details about the mysterious Resident Evil Village DLC that could be anything at this point. Barring that, an \"out later today!\" release of RE2, RE3, and RE7 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S would be nice.\n[Cindy Lou Who voice]: Where are you Dragon's Dogma 2?

And what's striking about Immortality at first is how simply it starts.

While neither title is particularly long, (lasting a mere hour and change), Bright Memory is lauded for its staggering revelation that it was entirely designed, coded, and built by a single developer — making its highly impressive visuals and breathless gameplay all the more fascinating.\nWhile Bright Memory: Infinite is admittedly a little more about its concept and invention than its actual execution, it still makes for a fun couple of hours, with combat that can be snugly described as a first-person Devil May Cry. The console editions have been tweaked to include extra features — such as DualSense integration — and the PS5 and Xbox Series X editions are expected to run a silky-smooth 120 FPS when in Performance Mode. Swish. Check out Chris Carter's review right here.\nBright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X and Switch this year.\nThe post Bright Memory: Infinite brings its controlled chaos to consoles this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

The pact would, once the deal has gone through, ensure Microsoft takes a neutral approach should employees at Activision Blizzard consider forming a union.\nThe labor neutrality agreement will take effect 60 days after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard closes. In a press release from the CWA, it says the agreement reflects a belief by both organizations that \"enabling workers to freely and fairly make a choice about union representation will benefit Microsoft and its employees.\"\nFive basic provisions of the agreement will apply to Activision Blizzard employees, once the acquisition …",

Armed with a sword and shield, Zeon’s abilities are enhanced when he’s pitted against stronger enemies.\"\n\nNext, we have to hover back over to the Japanese Nintendo Twitter account, because this is how Nintendo delivers segmented chunks of news these days, even on bigger games.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character trailer:\nhttps://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1536244016907694082\nThrough the above account, we actually get a much better look at the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character reveal in video form, which more than does its job. Big sword? Check. Protecting the party? Check.\nI'm a sucker for tank characters, and the getup of knight armor and an anime glowing sword and shield really do it for me.

The sequel features a dual storyline that sees put-upon investigator Francis Zach/York Morgan investigating a Bostonian murder in the past, while being interrogated over said case and its horrendous aftermath in the present. Guide our hero in past and present as they uncover the sinister psychological torment that lies beneath the surface of the sublime Le Carré.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSy6-23ihEQ\nWhile Deadly Premonition 2 features the strange dialogue, goofy action sequences, and overall sense of compelling weirdness that is the series' trademark, it was also lambasted at launch for its myriad technical issues, some of which went beyond the realm of parody and into poor value. Unfortunately, according to reports in the Steam forums, it seems that this new port carries its own weight in both new and old technical issues, (though it seems that the frame rate issues have been fixed).\nIn true Deadly Premonition style, it seems that this release is really just for those who have no problem dropping cash on irony, warts and all. Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch. The Steam port is being sold at a discounted price until June 18.\nThe post Rubbish sequel Deadly Premonition 2 is now available on PC via Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new Supers take Them's Fightin' Herds to a whole new level, with gorgeous, cartoony, and very amusing attacks to put a big, dramatic finish on your beatdown. From Arizona's lasso-crazy multi-slam, to Paprika's ultra hug of death, Tianhuo's demonstration of their martial arts expertise, and Pom's Akuma-esque touch of death — these new supers are packed with personality and character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsG0DYF1yo\nIn addition, all current and future TFH players can now download DLC character Shanty free of charge. Incidentally, the G.O.A.T. herself has perhaps my favorite super, featuring a barrage of cannonballs from her nearby ship, ending in a spectacular explosion. Them's Fightin' Herds has spent the past four years building upon its great foundation, determined to prove itself a major contender among its big-budget contemporaries. It's a great fighter, no doubt, and the console release — officially called for later in 2022 — will be sure to add more than a few new disciples to the herd.\nThem's Fightin' Herds is available now on PC. It will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms this fall.  You can check out the full list of balance tweaks and bug fixes over on Steam.\nThe post Check out Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ wonderful new cinematic Supers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Note that you'll need to (at least temporarily) agree with marketing communications from GOG to claim it, and have a logged-in account to boot.\nDefinitely do it, even if you have no intention of playing it anytime soon! Pirate's Curse is an interesting deviation from the Shantae formula, as it sees the titular character losing her genie powers in favor of going on a more traditional adventure.

But before that actually arrives sometime in 2023, there's a free Ark (the original) promo going on over on Steam. It typically goes for $29.99 on the platform.\nAs usual, the standard provisos apply. The team could cut off the offer as it runs until \"supplies last,\" though it's not particularly common for this to happen. Also, you don't get Steam trading cards via free games like this. Note that there is a cutoff time! You have until June 19 at 10:00AM PT to click \"own.\" Just go log in and do it here in browser form!\nAfter you pick the game up, there's a decent chunk of free and paid stuff to grab. Beyond the $29.99 season pass (which is on sale for $23.99 at the moment), there's also several expansion maps that you can pick up for free, including \"Lost Island, Valguero, The Center, and Crystal Isles and Ragnarok\" variations. A \"Primitive Plus\" total conversion mod is also free, which is intriguing in and of itself: \"Primitive Plus is a free add-on for ARK: Survival Evolved that alters the available tools, weapons and structures in the game to reflect what humans could realistically create using primitive technology and resources. This does not simply remove advanced technology from ARK, but instead replaces it with a multitude of new resources, engrams and systems.\"\nWhile Ark might not be for everyone (and the survival genre is sure to scare off droves of people on principle), you could spend an entire weekend diving into this game before realizing you don't even like it.\nThe post Ark is free to keep on Steam for a limited time appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's been a trip! \"E3 2022\" has been trying at times, but now is the time to share your favorite reveal of this past week.\nFor me, it was the Persona on Xbox announcement. The fact that this trio of killer games is coming to PC [beyond what we already got], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, is pretty huge news. Although they're older releases (well, Royal technically isn't that old), it's a trifecta announcement: so I'm kind of cheating here.\nIt's just lovely to see this series live on, on as many platforms as possible. I can still recall the first time I played Persona 2 with my cousin; huddled away in my relative's house, never realizing how big this series would one day get. I watched Persona 3 claw its way onto the PSP after a PS2 release, and now, it's coming to Xbox consoles, potentially before PS5 and Switch. That's wild!\nA bit of housekeeping for what's on the horizon. So to be clear, all the major showcases are done as of this afternoon.

Oops.\nAnyway, those who have been waiting to dive into its gory gaslit world will be pleased to hear that Gloomwood finally has an Early Access date, and will be opening its creaky wooden doors on Steam come August 16. Gloomwood's stealth 'n' slash action will come as snug entertainment to those who enjoyed that '90s Thief titles, which clearly presented a form of inspiration to the New Blood devs.\nIn between all the creeping and cranium-axing, players can also indulge in a spot of suitcase arranging, ala Resident Evil 4, which as fans know is almost a compelling game in and of itself.

          "description": "Go on\nBackfirewall (stylized as Backfirewall_) is one of the more interesting games shown off during the PC Gaming Show today: it's about an OS that doesn't want to update. That alone has me intrigued! PC Gamer, says that it's a \"tragicomedy,\" and is a self-aware parody at points, with elements of Stanley Parable and Portal.\nDescribed as a series of \"puzzles and gags,\" in Backfirewall_ you'll explore various bits of the OS, including different types of apps, to swipe through the narrative. Apparently there are shades of Toy Story afoot, with the intent of having players ponder the inner workings and feelings of an OS. You'll become attached to OS9, as the OS10 update arrives: and decide what to do from there.\nCreative drector Julia Jean had this to say about the premise: \"We want players to feel like they're playing inside a Pixar movie while also reflecting on the rather mindless way in which we interact with our everyday digital devices. If you think twice before you update your phone after playing Backfirewall_, our job is done!\"\nIt's also one of the few games shown today in the PC Gaming Show coming to Switch! It'll arrive on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X later this year. A demo is available now until June 20.\nBackfirewall _ debut trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijGqml8b7ek\nThe post Backfirewall is about an OS that doesn’t want to update appeared first on Destructoid.",

KeokeN promises \"a suspense-filled, emotion-fuelled narrative alongside music from award-winning composer Sander Van Zanten, state-of-the-art motion capture, stunning graphics and real-time ray-traced shadows and reflections, powered by Unreal Engine.\"\nAlready this summer has been jam-packed with space adventures, but it seems that Deliver Us Mars might be dialing back a little on the horror, focusing more on its exploration, adaptation, and deep adventure — not that it won't feature its own fair share of outer space peril, of course. It's not looking too bad at all, as you can see for yourself in the new trailer below.\nDeliver Us Mars launches September 27 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_v3rgzvNpE\nThe post Deliver Us Mars is entering the fast-filling interstellar adventure genre appeared first on Destructoid.",

The PC Gaming Show today gave us another look at some Agent 64 gameplay via a new trailer.\nWhile we didn't get a ton of new info, we did get some kernels due to a new piece from PC Gamer. It's \"out in early access later this year,\" and no multiplayer is re-confirmed, alongside of multiple difficulty modes. The game will feature a CRT visual filter, and some portions of the game have been shored up as a result of the 2021 alpha testing: including quicker firing control considerations, and a more arcadey feel with hip-firing. The team also reminds us that the demo is available now on Steam.\nA lack of multiplayer could be seen as a missed opportunity, but it's actually kind of refreshing in a way. I know I'll be able to just dive into this, finish it up, and put it on the shelf. In an era of endless games as a service, it's a welcome respite. \"Early access later this year\" doesn't quite grab me though!

The new title, leading on from hits Her Story and Telling Lies, will launch on PC and Xbox Game Pass on July 26.\nImmortality tasks the player with uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of failed actor Marissa Marcel, whose three uncompleted movies never saw the light of day. Utilizing groundbreaking linking mechanics, the player is tasked with finding links between scenes, using props, characters, and the scenery itself to uncover the answers hidden behind Marcel's ultimate fate.\nWhile FMV games are renowned for their limited appeal and slight player interaction, Barlow has won plaudits for finding ways to take the genre to a whole new level, bringing in interesting and novel ideas, quality performances, and compelling mysteries to hold the player's interest throughout. No doubt that Immortality will see Barlow once again make something special out of the genre's limited toolset.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz6u650zkg\nThe post Follow the branching paths to solve the cold case of Immortality appeared first on Destructoid.",

The upcoming farming simulator I Am Future is ready to change that narrative with a sunnier outlook on the end of the world. Taking place about six months after the event that supposedly ended it all, the game is full of vibrant blues and greens as nature has reclaimed the urban landscape in an area named Eden.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fs1ACCUxgg\nI Am Future's protagonist is as optimistic as they come, too, as he is seemingly unperturbed that he's the only human as far as the eye can see. He's at least excited to get started on rebuilding, and I have to give him credit for being a man who knows what he wants. According to an article from PC Gamer, you can play I Am Future at your own pace -- there's no one to answer to, no grinding to reach the top of the proverbial pile.

He mused on how primitive the old UI was for the original, and the \"unfortunate\" nature of the modern era not really seeing the influence of System Shock.\nHe also told PC Gamer the following:\n\"I think of myself, as much as anything, as a relentless advocate for a particular kind of game, the genre we call immersive simulation. Games that are designed to let the player feel—basically force the player to feel—like it's them in the world, with as few distractions and 'game-y' things as possible. System Shock was really, at the time, the most advanced version of that, and I can't tell you how much the team is responsible for that.\"\n\nIt's still due out on PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox One/Xbox Series X.

          "description": "After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.\nThree tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. \nUpgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. \nHow To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly\nThere are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions. In there, you'll find your PS+ subscription. Once you've entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. \nSelecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you'd like to pay for on a recurring basis. \nOnce you've locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you're ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you're not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.",

Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.\n\n\nThanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.\nIn typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.\nThe trailer gave an early access date of \"202?\" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.",

You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.\n\n\nThis new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.\nSystem Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.\n\n\n \nJan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.\nDuring the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a \"classic sci-fi\" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.\n \n\nIt seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.",

What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.\n\n\nThe demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.\nI'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: \n“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” \nPentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. \nWhile waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.\nAre you excited for Pentiment?

It makes statements like, \"Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.\" The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.\nThe multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it's unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. \nGuess we'll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.\nCocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players \"on an adventure across worlds within worlds,\" which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.\n\n\n There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. \nCocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023.

          "description": "Koei Tecmo Games and Team Ninja have revealed Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and it’s coming to Xbox consoles and PC next year. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja’s Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: \nIt looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Nioh review, and then check out our thoughts on Nioh 2 after that. \nAre you excited for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty?

          "description": "Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.\nDrawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.\nThe new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.\nEbb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.\nThe developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.\nWhile the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.\nScorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.",

Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we've come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. \nPREVIOUS STORY\nAccording to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. \nThis wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. \nForza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: \n“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”\nAre you excited about the alleged crossover?\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.\nFirst, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.\nIn League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.\nIn Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.\nIn Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.\nAnd in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.\nIt’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.\nWhile Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.\nThe availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.",

          "description": "Squanch Games has announced High On Life, a new first-person shooter from the mind of Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland. \nSquanch Games revealed High On Life during today’s Xbox gaming showcase, and the first trailer for it highlights talking guns, alien cartels, and plenty of Roiland-style humor. It’s appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year. \n“After a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,” a press release reads. “The alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.\n“[Defeating] powerful aliens isn’t going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what’s going on.” \n\nSquanch Games’ studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland’s comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio’s other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it’s a Squanch game. \n“I wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,” Roiland writes in a press release. “Then we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we’re on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.” \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Trover Saves The Universe review and catch up on all the biggest gaming news from Summer Game Fest 2022 and other June showcases. \nAre you excited about High On Life?

The idyllic town falls apart when residents disappear and, worse, become vampires. If that’s not enough, some survivors have taken to worshipping these night creatures as deranged cultists. Up to four players team up as a band of survivors who must fight back and escape Redfall with their lives intact. \n\n\nThe crew consists of protagonist Layla, who wields telekinesis, the sniper Jacob, the engineer Remy (with a cute robot companion in tow), and cryptid hunter Devinder. The gameplay trailer shows how these four combine their abilities to combat hordes of undead, such as Layla creating a telekinetic elevator to launch an ally skyborne. \nRedfall releases in early 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and will launch day one on Game Pass.",

          "description": "2017's Serial Cleaner was all about stealthfully infiltrating a murder scene and cleaning up the mess before the cops got their hands on any evidence. Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.\n\n\nUnlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino's body of work and other classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can't let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners' street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.\nIf you're ready to aid and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.\nAs Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.\nBeyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.\nBeyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you’ve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.\nAs Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.\nArctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.",

          "description": "Today’s Future Games Show gave us a new look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a visually arresting upcoming game from Dimfrost Studio. Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.\nThe studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger – all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game’s footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.\nThe studio describes a focus on “David vs. Goliath” bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the Näcken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the Näcken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him – including the girl that he loved.\nBased on the description explored in the trailer, it’s clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster’s narratives as part of the unfolding game. The Näcken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.\nThe footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.\nDimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.\nBramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.",

          "description": "Kumi Souls Games has been rather quiet on social media about its upcoming gothic-horror action game The Last Faith, but as part of the Future Games Show presentation, we were able to see how it's shaping up. The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.\nThe Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair. Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it's strangely impressive how gross some details of these attacks come off in the pixel low-rez art.\nFollowing a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.\nWe don't have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

It will now be released on August 10, as announced during GamesRadar's Future Games Show livestream. \nThe new trailer shows our protagonists – a brother and sister – on their whimsical journey through childhood animation. You can see it below:\n\n\nInterestingly, per Lost in Play's Steam page, the game has no dialogue; storytelling is told visually. That story will take the brother and sister to a \"goblin castle\" and \"ancient ruins,\" as well as letting them \"soar atop a giant stork.\"\nLost in Play will be released on Switch and PC.",

During today’s Future Game Show, we found out that the wacky sports game is coming this August. Can’t wait? Don’t despair; you can play the game in its second beta right now. \nFor the unfamiliar, the game pits up to eight players against each other as they race giant golf balls down obstacle-filled courses to knock them into the finish cup. Vehicles can jump and glide, and collecting power-ups lets players hit the ball further, and perform ground stomps, among other abilities. \n\n\nDeveloper Secret Mode announced that Turbo Golf Racing launches on Xbox consoles and PC on August 4. Beginning today, Beta 2 kicks off on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. This larger test features 12 courses, eight-player online multiplayer (with crossplay), single-player time trials, and improvements based on feedback from Beta 1. Leveling up during Beta 2 unlocks exclusive cosmetic wheels, an avatar, and a spoiler for the final game. Beta 2 concludes on June 20. \nTurbo Golf Racing arrives to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on August 4 and will be available on Game Pass.",

That’s great because The Entropy Centre looks like an intriguing and fun puzzle game. A new British indie studio called Stubby Games is developing it, and Playstack is publishing the title. It is built around a puzzle mechanic that “allows players to think in reverse and overcome seemingly impossible obstacles,” such as the game’s main obstacle: reversing time far enough back to stop Earth from imploding.\nY…",

This first-person horror experience is bound to scare the pants off of somebody, especially with its impressive cloth rendering, making a particular terror in the new footage a sight to behold.\n\n\nDeveloper Broken Bird Games is looking to create an immersive and emotional experience with Luto. Players take control of a character attempting to escape from their house, but trying to do just that will take you to some wild and spooky places. The new footage is full of atmospheric locales, such as dilapidated rooms filled with mysterious chains, dark hallways populated by sheet-covered individuals, and a hollowed-out cave system. Much of the lighting and materials presented in the footage look great, especially the sheet physics and rendering of an entity that breaks into a hallway and rises to its feet in an unsettling way.\nLuto is set to launch on PlayStation and PC in 2022.",

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.\nNo matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSanitarium\nHades Challenge\nMarvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six\nThe 11th Hour\nClandestiny\nTender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)\nUncle Henry's Playhouse\nWetlands\nChewy: Esc from F5\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nThe AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support!\n>",

          "description": "After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.\nIf any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. \nPlease note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.\n>",

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
