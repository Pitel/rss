As you’ll see here, you do have a choice of worthwhile upgrade options, ranging from conventional hard cases with extra accessory storage to clever protective sleeves that combine impact resistance with improved handheld grip. The best way to avoid Steam Deck damage is to not drop it in the first place, as Sun Tzu probably said.\nRead more",

It's all shaping up very nicely, and if I'd been playing the demo, I'm sure it would have woken me up better than any emergency deluge of instant coffee.

It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory.

She'll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the \"extreme\" version of the boss. Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.\r\n \nRead more",

Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed.

But leftier souls may have preferred Volition's (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.\nWell, Guerrilla's lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames's latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here's the 1.0 trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don't especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I'm still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral \"SpookTube\" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. \nEach video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of \"cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation\" and \"cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views\". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success. \n Read more",

Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”\nZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens.

          "description": "It's been a while since I played a game as effortlessly cool as Underdogs. This VR mech-fighting game has you pilot a giant mechanical gorilla, pummelling robots and human-controlled mechs with arms the length of lorries in grungy, trap-filled arenas. The combat alone is chest-thumpingly good, but Underdogs couples it with a fantastically evocative cyberpunk setting, and a smartly implemented rogue-like structure.\nRead more",

          "description": "Windowkill is the most inventive arcade shooter I've played for years.\nIt's twin-stick shooting in a tiny window that temporarily expands in that direction when you shoot its edges. You have to actively manage and maintain the play space itself for that to even be an option. Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.\nIt's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.\nI think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.\n \nRead more",

There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.\nRead more",

After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.\nImportantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's. This is lovely.\nRead more",

          "description": "A couple of decades ago there was a period when all videogames and especially all Unreal Engine videogames had to be brown and grey and dingy. \"The Gears of Warrification of graphics,\" we used to call it, huddled up in the chest-high trenches with our Xbox 360 controllers. Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. \r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When Herbert Spencer coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" to describe Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory, I'm pretty sure he didn't envisage the rise of a species of videogame, the survival sim, which would one day itself suffer an unsustainable population explosion during the layoff-ridden years of 2023 and 2024. What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct? If you're Palworld, the answer is gleefully borrowing and travestying monster concepts from a celebrated Nintendo series. If you're Enshrouded, it's all about having a really neat building system. And if you're Dune: Awakening, the next game from Conan Exiles developer Funcom, the trick may lie with sandworms. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like the good works of Calvin Klein, these genes come pre-distressed. Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.\nThis look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.\nRead more",

Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions.

          "description": "Following up yesterday’s news on Ghost Story Games’ upcoming Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, another interview with the Friends Per Second podcast, via SkillUp on YouTube, has shed light aplenty on the upcoming Bioshock-ian FPS game. The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.\nNot least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now. \n \nRead more",

I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to \"a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it's 1000 metres in extent\". Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?\r\n\n\r\nStill, I'm very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it's the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based \"immersive experiences\" and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it's a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it's inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet \"secret cities\" given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn't make the last bus out of town.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it's an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,\" says Levine. \r\n\n\r\nJudas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness. \r\n\n\n Read more",

          "description": "The early stages of a new weapon can be a bit rough due to the limitations of Gunsmith items. Although you'll claim these tools later on, it can sometimes take a while with the more advanced levels. So, to quicken the pace, here's how to use the Unlock All Attachments glitch in MW3 and Warzone. \n\n\nUnlock All Attachments Without Leveling Up Glitch in MW3 and Warzone, explained\n\n\nTo unlock all attachments without leveling up in Warzone and MW3, customize a gun in a Private match. The weapon must be unlocked first in Multiplayer or Warzone, as the Base version is required. For example, if you haven't completed three Daily Challenges for the TAQ Evolvere, you won't be able to utilize the glitch for this gun's attachments. \n\n\nOnce you have a weapon in mind, go to the Private Match section in either the Warzone or MW3 Playlist. Now, select the Weapons section and customize the gun with any attachments. Private Matches provide access to the entire catalog, regardless of whether it is locked in the Public Playlists. Press 'Save a Custom Mod,' which is shown in the bottom-left corner. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nExit the Private Match and select a public game in Warzone or MW3. Go to the Weapons section, and the saved custom mod should now be available in the Gunsmith section. This allows you to access all attachments without leveling up, even if the Base version doesn't include these tools. I tried it out with my previous locked items and had no problems when diving into a match. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe glitch for unlocking all attachments has appeared throughout Call of Duty's timeline. However, it does seem to get patched after some time. With MW3 and Warzone Season 3's launch, the glitch has come up again now that the game has been updated. The trick could eventually be patched, so just bear that in mind for the future.   \n\nThe post How to use the Unlock All Attachments Glitch in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s buried in the user documents behind some vaguely named folders. Let’s just move on to the next paragraph, where I can be more specific.\n\n\nPalworld save games location for Steam\n\n\nOn PC, if you want to reach your save data, just paste this path into Windows Explorer's address bar: %localappdata%\\Pal\\Saved\\SaveGames and it should take you straight to it. \n\n\nIf it doesn’t take you there because, for example, you haven’t rebuilt your user profiles after several OS upgrades, then you should be able to follow this path there: C:\\Users\\insertusernamehere\\AppData\\Local\\Pal\\Saved\\SaveGames. “C:” can be whatever drive letter is holding your OS.\n\n\nNote that you cannot just browse to the saved games through the game’s Steam properties. The saved game is not contained within the Steam folder; it’s in your user files.\n\n\nAlso note that the AppData folder is sometimes hidden by windows. While the %localappdata% string should still take you there, you may need to go to the view tab on the ribbon and check the box next to “hidden files.”\n\n\nEach saved game is a folder that is named a long string of numbers. If you’re backing up your saves (for example, if you're installing mods), that’s what you’re going to want to copy elsewhere.\n\n\nPalworld save games location for Gamepass\n\n\nThe method to finding the Gamepass version’s save files is different is different. For that one you’ll want to use %localappdata%\\Packages\\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\\SystemAppData\\wgs\n\n\nOtherwise, navigate to C:\\Users\\insertusernamehere\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\\SystemAppData\\wgs\n\n\nAgain, you may need to enable “hidden files” in the ribbon to actually get this far. However, in the wgs folder you should find your saves. You can then copy them elsewhere.\n\nThe post Where to find your Palworld save data location appeared first on Destructoid.",

Keep farming as many Wimpods as possible, and you may be lucky enough to stumble upon the Shiny version. \n\n\nThe event-themed Field Research tasks may also provide a Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go. Complete these limited-time objectives to encounter this version. Specifically, the 'Catch three Wimpod' task can unlock the Shiny Wimpod's spawn. Use PokéStops to trigger these Field Research quests, as they won't appear automatically. Although you may be inclined to test the waters in Raids, Shiny Wimpods do not appear in these challenges. \n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\nIf you miss your chance during Sizeable Surprises, don't worry; there's another opportunity shortly after. Shiny Wimpods can appear during the Bug Out event, which starts on April 12 at 10 a.m. and ends on April 17 at 8 p.m. local time. Complete any event-themed Field Research tasks during this celebration to spawn this type. \n\n\nTo evolve the Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go, use 400 Wimpod Candy. This ingredient requires plenty of Wimpod captures, but luckily, these events consistently spawn this creature. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's one of several new item additions to multiplayer horror game and can be a pretty fun tool for filming your videos for Spooktube. Here is how to use the Projector in Content Warning and why it exists in the first place.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhere is the Projector?\n\n\nThe Projector kind of blends in and can be tricky to find if you don't know where to look. When you first step out of the house, look for the Sunflowers in the back straight ahead. Head forward until you reach the Sunflowers and then look to your left and you will see both the Projector and the Projector screen.\n\n\nFor now, it seems as though the Projector and screen are static, meaning you can't change where they are and will always have to return to this location when you want to use the Projector.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat can you do with the Projector?\n\n\nAs you approach the actual Projector, hit E to turn it on. It will now display a slide or image on the Projector's green screen in front of you. There are two knobs on the top of the Projector that you can also interact with to cycle through all the different backgrounds to display on the screen. Interacting with the right knob will show you the next scene while interacting with the left knob goes to the previous screen. You can cycle through all the scenes to find some pretty cool ones like city landscapes, backdrops, images of space, a breaking news screen, and much more.\n\n\nThe Projector exists for you and your friends to record some cool footage on your Video Camera before descending to the Old World or after returning. You can use the screen in the background to create backdrops for your footage which will spruce it up and get you more views when you upload it to Spooktube!\n\nThe post How to use the Projector in Content Warning appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Success in AFK Journey really comes down to your party. Not merely the characters you have fill it, but their roles as well. As a gacha game, your available heroes in AFK Journey is going to come down largely to luck. You’ll hopefully be able to, at the very least, fill certain roles, so we’ll stop there.\n\n\nNow, before we get started, I’m going to help you leg up that basically everyone recommends. Get yourself Thoran. When I was starting out, that’s the hero that kept on popping up on the list. And to be honest, when I slotted him into my party and put him on the frontline, I improved considerably.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWith that in mind, and even if you don’t have Thoran, the ideal party follows RPG rules: \n\n\n\nDPS, Tank, and Healer \n\n\n\nThe other two are wild cards. This isn’t a hard rule in terms of party comp, but it’s the most effective one.\n\n\nHealers can be the hardest to spot to fill, since not every Support hero has strong healing spells. You’ll need to actually look at what spells they have to ensure they have ones for effective healing. Hewynn, for example, can heal the whole group in one spell.\n\n\nFor DPS, your Warriors are the most all-around, but my personal preference is mages. Cecia has been my favorite for a while now, as one of her spells spawns an additional unit to both take and deal further damage. Often, I see Odie recommended as an archer role, which, again, I slotted into my party, and things immediately improved.\n\n\nAs for your tank: Thoran. If you don’t have Thoran, any hero with the Tank role can generally fill this spot. The more you rely on DPS, the more important a tank is.\n\n\nFor your wildcards, Scarlita is an excellent choice for shields. Another mage is often my preference because I love mages. With that in mind, maybe just pick the heroes you connect with most. However, if you want further recommendations of who belongs in your party, check out our AFK Journey tier list.\n\nThe post AFK Journey: Best team comps appeared first on Destructoid.",

Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Stellar Blade feature for behind-the-scenes details and new insight from Tae. \n[Source: Ruliweb]\nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch.

Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, \"We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.\" The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.\nStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register.

          "description": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is \"alive and well,\" according to Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch. He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. \nLast month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. \n\n\nNow, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. \n\"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this,\" Karch told the publication. \"It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.\" \nThat's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. \nFor more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays. After that, check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you still excited for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake?

It sounds annoying, but to my surprise, it's made me enjoy the game even more than I already did.\nIt's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere.

          "description": "Last week, Embracer Group announced it was selling Gearbox Software to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million. Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.\nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. \n\"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,\" says Gearbox as part of its statement. \"The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.\"\nWhile Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  \nEmbracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.\nNine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. \n\n\nThe 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. \nNine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.",

A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release.

The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a \"people first\" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, \"deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.\"\n\"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release\"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world.

          "description": "Stellar Blade’s development was announced in 2019 by Korean developer Shift Up Second EVE Studio for current-gen consoles, boasting talent from the popular MMO Blade & Soul. It wasn’t until 2021, however, that we got our first proper look at Stellar Blade during a PlayStation showcase, where it was shown with its former title, Project Eve.\nFor those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along. As she careens through space further and further away from the station, it is revealed that a much …",

          "description": "If you've been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it's no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.\nThirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.\nThe relevant section says, \"Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.\"\nThere's really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there's no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft's private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.\nFor more Bethesda, check out the news about The Elder Scrolls' newest spin-off,  read our Starfield review, and see which Xbox games are coming to other platforms.",

Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the \"near future,\" but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches.

In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
