          "description": "Cutting open some Cold Ones with the boys.\nWhile the world continues to wait in vain for Konami to release another 2D Castlevania, plenty of indie game developers have stepped up to try filling the gap with their own take on the famed formula. Some of these games have almost copied the gameplay beat for beat, such as in Timespinner or Chasm, while others have taken things in a more unique direction, such as Blasphemous’ 2D Soulslike take set in a Spanish-inspired world. The Last Faith falls more into this latter camp, and while it does stumble a bit in its execution and performance on Switch, this is an overall compelling game that’s certainly worth your consideration.\nThe Last Faith follows the story of Eryk, a grim man with amnesia who’s been afflicted with a mysterious curse that’s slowly consuming him. Eryk awakens on the edge of a massive gothic city called Mythringal, and it doesn’t take long for him to recognize that something has gone horribly wrong, as its many inhabitants have become mutated beasts that attack on sight. As he searches for someone who can cure him, Eryk slowly pieces together the details of the civil war that led to the fall of Mythringal and the role that he played in it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Gone is the notion that genres like real-time strategy (RTS) and management sims can’t be controlled with a standard controller, and we have the likes of Two Point Campus and RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition on Switch to prove it. Joining that field is SteamWorld Build, the latest game in the beloved SteamWorld series, and the first in 3D.\nOn the surface, things seem very simple. You have a city in which you need to build (!) homes, refineries, and resource extractors. Each home can house a maximum number of workers, and the happier they are — dictated by the service buildings nearby and the resources available — the closer to that maximum you’ll get. SteamWorld Build does such an excellent job of easing you into its mechanics that it can seem almost painfully basic at first glance, but that’s all part of the plan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dredge was pretty weird to begin with. The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. \r\n\n\r\nSpoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.\n Read more",

It's the work of former Hi-Rez subsidiary and nowadays independent studio Prophecy Games, and going by SteamDB listings, it's called Tribes 3: Rivals.\nNew to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of \"the world's fastest shooter\". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.\nRead more",

          "description": "In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.\nDespite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.\nRead more",

AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it \"a stonkingly fast gaming CPU\". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.\r\n\n\r\nNow I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review \"if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance.\"\r\n \nRead more",

In my multiplayer review, I say that it preys on nostalgia, because it does! The game's multiplayer schtick is all about bringing back classic maps to act as a smokescreen for a lack of direction. At least, that's what I think.\nI find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.\nRead more",

          "description": "Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.\r\n\n\r\nIt works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.\r\n\n\r\nJust want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.\r\n \nRead more",

Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model.

If you liked The Messenger - classique Ninja Gaiden's greatest heir - but wished it was More Cyberpunk with cheesy PG-rated holographic dancing girls and Comix Zone-style story panels, I also also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. \r\n\n\nOut today, it's the work of solo Korean dev Asteroid-J, and based on the first level, is pretty decent. It does have quite a lot of dialogue for a ninja platformer, but the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, and hopefully it'll fall by the wayside as you push beyond the tutorial sections.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I very much do not feel like an Edo era John Constantine. I don't even feel like an Edo era Scooby Doo.

          "description": "Logitech's MX Keys S is a nice low-profile keyboard for folks that have tried mechanical keyboards and don't want none of that clicking and clacking in their quiet corner of the home/office, no thank you sirree. The MX Keys S basically feels like the best laptop keyboard you've ever tried, with quiet scissor switches that are quick to operate with precision. The graphite colour scheme looks pretty neat too. \nAt £85, rather than the regular £110, this is a pretty good value for a full-size wireless keyboard that supports both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth, making it a good fit for Mac, PC and many more devices besides. \nRead more",

That's because it's a Metroidvania platformer and, when it is time for back-and-forth combat, you're not choosing attacks from a menu. Instead you're stringing together combos in real-time, then when your alotted attack time is over, you're parrying enemy assaults with rhythmic flair. \r\n\nSo, turn-based, yes, but with a twist.

They get tangled, they trip you up, and they're generally a nuisance. No wonder Darth Vader was grumpy all the time. He was full of wires.\r\n\n\r\nFew manufacturers understand this better than Logitech, whose G915 Lightspeed Wireless keyboard has been the ideal way to type without tethers for years. It combines a slim yet robust build quality with wonderfully tactile keys, incredibly fast response times, respectable battery life, and a truly standout volume wheel. Perhaps for that reason, the G915 Lightspeed has also maintained its lofty price point, with an RRP of around £220. But as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can currently grab the best wireless keyboard for almost half price. It's currently available for £125 in the UK, and $160 in the US, which is 46% and 36% off respectively.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "No matter how old it gets, people still seem to flock to Skyrim and its chilly world of fantasy possibilities. The fact that there are so many interesting NPCs to interact with arguably makes it that extra bit appealing. But what happens when you grow tired of this slice of Tamriel being full of characters and wildlife?\n\n\nWhy, you go on a killing spree, of course. That's what Reddit user amelix34 did at least (thanks GamesRadar). A post on the Skyrim sub shows sheer dedication when it comes to attempting to kill every possible thing in the game.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the user, they've managed to kill 3,310 people, 693 animals, 401 creatures, 947 undead, 55 Deadra, and 98 Automatons (such as the Dwarven Spider). That's over 5,500 characters, animals, and enemies killed, which may or may not be the maximum figure across the whole of the RPG.\n\n\nSounds tiring\n\n\nObviously, that's not counting characters that can't be killed, such as children or those pertinent to the main quest. However, this could well represent the maximum number of murders that can be done in The Elder Scrolls 5.\n\n\nAnother image shows that amelix34 has managed to amass a lifetime bounty of 267,140. But then again, if all the guards in the game have been killed, who exactly is going to retrieve that? Exactly.\n\n\nDespite the attempt to pretty much wipe any sign of life off the face of Skyrim (non-killables notwithstanding, of course), the user did say they made an exception when it came to Paarthurnax and Shadowmere. Good to see they're not a total psychopath then.\n\n\nAll-in-all, it's just one of the many ways that TES5 remains in the gaming limelight more than 12 years after its release. Its legacy is hard to surpass, despite the issues it has (perhaps even because of them). Even Bethesda's own Starfield can't match such a legendary status.\n\nThe post Skyrim player tries to kill everything possible, mayhem ensues appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remedy is known for its meta-narratives and intricately detailed worlds. Fans are familiar with this, and a hidden QR code demonstrates just how forward-thinking the Finnish developers are. \n\n\nIn Alan Wake, there are QR codes that can be scanned to gain additional content and plot information. They're not essential, but they're nice to find if you're interested in knowing all the details of the Remedy Connected Universe. Alan Wake Remastered, released in 2021, features the same gimmick, though there are new codes thrown in. \n\n\nSome of the new QR codes describe Alan's time in the Dark Place, foreshadowing what we've seen of the location in Alan Wake 2. The code found in Chapter 4 links you to Vision 03 which appears to perfectly narrate the opening sequence of the sequel. \n\n\nAlan describes a dark forest where a nude man walks, terrified. He sees a deer carcass on the ground, his fear heightens, and he runs deeper into the forest. This is exactly what happens at the start of the sequel which has you controlling Nightingale, naked, as he finds his way through the woods. A YouTuber has played the QR audio over the scene to illustrate the parallels. \n\n\n\n\nThis isn't the only Easter egg that Remedy has hidden in prior games. If you visit the Oceanview Motel in Control, you'll spot a door with a spiral on it, which is one of the main motifs of Alan Wake 2.

          "description": "Since its launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has been celebrated, though some players have been complaining about bugs and poor performance. Larian recently explained why this is happening and what the plans to fix it are. \n\n\nMany players have been experiencing reduced framerates in Acts 2 and 3 of the game. According to a Larian developer, this has partially been caused by Patch 4 which ironically was released to fix bugs. It was meant to \"prevent the Scrying Eyes in Moonrise Towers from immediately calling the guards on you when stealing, even if you were sneaking, or invisible.\" \n\n\nIt achieved this, but a side-effect is that it kept the game continually storing your past acts of vandalism, violence, and theft well past the point when it's necessary. As the developer explains in layman's terms, \"your ‘DM’ - in a real-world sense - constantly thinks about the acts of theft & violence the player keeps doing.\" This bogs down the game, eventually affecting performance. \n\n\nNow that developers are aware of what is causing the problem, there are plans to have it mended in Patch 5 scheduled for this week. Though frustrating, the occurrence of the bug is somewhat hilarious, as it seems to punish those who are the most mischievous.\n\n\nLarian is still hard at work on Baldur's Gate 3, and a physical release is scheduled for early 2023. The team may enjoy the fruits of their labor soon, as the game has snatched the most number of nominations at this year's The Game Awards, tying with Alan Wake 2.\n\nThe post Your evil deeds may be causing Baldur’s Gate 3 bugs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A surprise hit from Shonen Jump + is getting its anime adaptation. The supernatural-and-extraterrestrial action-comedy manga Dandadan will be adapted into a TV anime series next year.\n\n\nIf you haven't heard of Dandadan, the elevator pitch is simple but effective. Two students, Ken Takakura (a.k.a. Okarun) and Momo Ayase, are at odds. The latter believes in ghosts, hailing from a family of spirit mediums. Takakura is obsessed with the occult—aliens, cryptids, and such. Both stubbornly agree to visit locations where the other believes supernatural experiences have occurred. \n\n\nSo, naturally, both of them are correct.\n\n\nWhat ensues is Yukinobu Tatsu's Dandadan, an energetic and action-filled manga with a surprising amount of heart. It seems incredibly well-suited for an anime adaptation, and even more, it's being produced by Science Saru.\n\n\n\n\nDandadan Takes Off\n\n\nScience Saru has quickly become a familiar name in animation, thanks to some incredible feature and series work. The studio, helmed by Masaaki Yuasa and Eunyoung Choi, was behind films like The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl and Inu-Oh, as well as series like Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, Devilman Crybaby, and the recent Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.\n\n\nLook at those series, and you see a particular knack for comedy, monsters, and surrealism that seems like a perfect fit for Dandadan. Fuuga Yamashiro is taking the director's chair on this series.\n\n\nThis series has been one I've absolutely adored reading through the backlogs of, as it manages to balance out emotional story beats with good laughs and action. Add in some stellar monsters and character design as the stakes escalate, and this could be hit for 2024. Considering the year we've already had in anime, it's a good time to be following it all.\n\nThe post Out-of-this-world manga Dandadan is getting an anime adaptation in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I own around 60, which isn’t as impressive as some of my other libraries, but considering I never actively tried to find Atari 2600 games, it says something.\n\n\nA major issue with this, however, is that every model of the 2600 uses an RF output, and modern TVs hate it.

Those interested in living out the life of an Assassin in London during the Industrial Revolution can do so at the Syndicate giveaway page. As long as you claim your free copy before December 6, you will be able to play even after the promotion ends. Unfortunately, it looks like the promotion is only available on PC via the Ubisoft Connect launcher.\n\n\n\n\nAt the time Assassin's Creed Syndicate was released, I was very much feeling the AC franchise burnout. I purchased Syndicate but never actually got around to playing it for more than just a few minutes. However, a little over a year ago I had some free time and played through the whole game and was very pleasantly surprised. In fact, I think Syndicate may be one of the best Assassin's Creed titles in the franchise.\n\n\nSyndicate was the last classic Assassin experience in the franchise before it started exploring more open-world narratives in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. The series recently returned to its roots with Mirage, but I'd still argue that Syndicate was overall the most polished assassin simulator we've gotten so far.\n\n\n\nThe post Very underrated Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is free on PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

All you have to do is go to the game in your library, open the Properties window, and select public-beta-test from the Betas tab. There are a few troubleshooting notes for anyone who has an issue finding the option. If you'd rather go back to the normal version during the test period, you'll be able to switch by selecting 'None' in the Betas tab. \n\n\nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in January 2018, followed by a release on Nintendo Switch that September.

According to the blog post, Season of the Wish which begins tomorrow will serve as the major content loop until The Final Shape releases in June.\n\n\n\n\nNew content planned for April\n\n\nThis equates to a roughly four-month delay, which while isn't the longest amount of time, sets Destiny 2 up for running with the same content loop for half a year which is a pretty long time. In an effort to break down the repetitiveness, Bungie plans to release a new content update in April titled Destiny 2: Into the Light. The two-month-long content update will prepare players for their journey into the Traveler.\n\n\nDestiny 2 Game Director Joe Blackburn also posted a video update on YouTube in which he broke down the content players can expect between now and the release of The Finale Shape.\n\n\nAs someone who hasn't played Destiny 2 in a while, I was genuinely interested in returning with The Final Shape. It seemed like a great opportunity to jump back on board with the newly added system to play through specific important story missions to get caught up on things. However, with the layoffs and now hefty delay, I have to admit I find the interest waning. \n\n\nFor those who are actively playing, is the updated content window for Season of the Wish too long?

Long-time fans of the franchise will be happy to see Generation I and Generation II characters as adorable plushies. Some of the other Pokémon that have been featured as Squishmallows are Snorlax, Togepi, Piplup and various versions of Pikachu.\n\n\nClefairy is a Fairy type Pokémon introduced in the first generation of Pokémon in 1996 ('98 for North America). Teddiursa is a Normal type Pokémon introduced to the franchise in Generation II, through Pokémon Gold and Silver. \n\n\nSomething fans may not know about Clefairy is that it’s an extraterrestrial Pokémon, meaning that it isn’t from Earth. The bubbly pink Pokemon is best known for being cute, among many other creatures in the franchise. Teddiursa, on the other hand, is very down to earth.

          "description": "By now, much of the indie horror scene is aware of Lethal Company, the small co-op hit that's currently taking the genre by storm. While it's hard to say how long this popularity will last, the game is not only staying at the top of the Steam charts, but has smashed its player peak again.\n\n\nAs of right now, Lethal Weapon has hit 184,015 players over the last 24 hours. The chart over on SteamDB shows the trajectory the game's currently experiencing, and it's entirely possible that it could just keep going. We could easily see it break through the 200,000 mark.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also still the top non-Deck game on Steam right now, having not budged since the last time we checked. Okay, it's only been a week, but seeing as the likes of Modern Warfare 3, Counter-Strike 2, and Baldur's Gate 3 are starting to drop, it's a hell of an achievement for an independent game.\n\n\nFor those who have yet to play it...\n\n\nCompared to such games as Phasmophobia, Lethal Company is something that should be right up the alley of horror co-op fans. That includes me, but sadly, I haven't got round to playing it yet. And I should, as it's extremely cheap to buy. I can't speak for other nations, but here in the UK, it's £8.50. I know some pubs that charge more for a pint than that.\n\n\nThe game's all about scavenging and collecting scrap for a company called...well...the Company. According to developer Zeekerss, you can \"use the cash you earn to travel to new moons with higher risks and rewards--or you can buy fancy suits and decorations for your ship.\"\n\n\nThe Steam reviews have also been pretty glowing, with it showing as \"Overwhelmingly Positive.\" User Cheiph describes it as a \"morbid, yet derpy masterpiece.\" I think it's high time I pull the finger out and finally see what all the fuss is over in Lethal Company.\n\nThe post Lethal Company smashes player record, retains top spot on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rumors and speculations have led many to believe that the release of the Silent Hill 2 remake is imminent. However, we're all still dreaming, and developer Bloober Team is asking that people chill out for a little bit longer.\n\n\nIn a statement posted to the studio's Twitter, Bloober has said it's \"diligently working to ensure the Silent Hill 2 remake attains the highest quality.\" Work is also said to be \"progressing smoothly,\" and the team understands that fans are waiting patiently for any updates.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in the meantime, the developer is kindly asking for \"a bit more patience\" from the fan base. The statement ends by assuring people that as and when publisher Konami does share information, the \"wait will be worthwhile.\"\n\n\nCommence thumb-twiddling\n\n\nUnderstandably, fans are keen to know what's happening with the much-anticipated remake. Silent Hill 2 is generally regarded as one of the most influential survival horror games of all time. Of course, with that comes a small amount of uncertainty and maybe a little pessimism.\n\n\nDespite their visual quality, Bloober Team games have been criticized in the past. Most notably, 2021's The Medium drew notes of disapproval for its depictions of mental health. That's not to say the game wasn't good, but some felt its representation of mental issues was lacking somewhat.\n\n\nAs a result, a few may be a little wary about how Bloober will handle Silent Hill 2, particularly in terms of its psychological themes. In any case, the studio is going to have to put a lot of effort in to keep new and old fans happy.\n\nThe post Bloober Team is asking for ‘a bit more patience’ re: Silent Hill 2 news appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the holiday season, a few games get Easter eggs. Better Than Life took to Twitter to reveal that the Christmas theme is returning to Kayak VR: Mirage, and it also gave an update regarding new content. \n\n\nFor the holiday season, Kings Canyon is spruced up with snowy mountains and flying sleighs. It's a minor change but it's a good way to get you into the festive season. The team also visited Reddit to address when new content is coming. \n\n\n\n\nBetter Than Life claims that development has been a hard process that took a toll on the three-person team. Consequently, they couldn't keep working at the same pace they had previously been. The team writes: \"this year has not been as productive as we would have liked it to be.\" If you're looking for more content, don't despair just yet, as it is still on the way, though it may take some time. \n\n\nPart of the delay is coming from the team porting the game to Unreal 5. This is being done to include \"visual improvements like nanite that really make a difference.\" It's also necessary for the sake of future-proofing. \n\n\nI previously discussed the current state of PS VR2, and Kayak VR: Mirage is one of the games that came up. Although it's a great game, I did point out that it gets boring quite quickly. With new content, I'll have a reason to revisit the visually beautiful VR title. \n\n\nIf you're looking for more games that feature holiday season Easter eggs, keep an eye on Death Stranding which typically has Sam Bridges in a Santa hat, or GTA: Online which usually has Los Santos snowy during December.\n\nThe post Christmas theme returns to Kayak VR: Mirage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "My Hero Ultra Rumble recently got a Season 2, just after its launch in September of this year. Bandai Namco dropped Season 2 of the MHA brawler on November 24, featuring one fiery addition to the roster in Endeavor.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most anticipated changes that Season 2 will feature is a new playable character. Fiery and fierce hero Endeavor has been added to the playable lineup. Endeavor is featured in the Plus Ultra Roll banner, while the vein-wielding hero Ibara is headed to the Character Tickets section.\n\n\nAlongside the Flame Hero, players are getting a new “Duo”, or two-player team, option where 12 teams of 2 can go head to head in battle. You can also spice up your fighters' looks in game with new costumes being added to My Hero Ultra Rumble Season 2.\n\n\nMy Hero Ultra Rumble is a fighting title based on the popular superhero manga-turned-anime My Hero Academia. This battle royale based fighter features matches between teams of players, made up of characters from MHA. In the series, characters are able to use “quirks” or supernatural abilities that make them a bit out of the ordinary, in combat and in everyday life.\n\n\nMy Hero Ultra Rumble only features an online mode, meaning that there is no offline option for the game at this time. The free-to-play fighter is available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe post My Hero Ultra Rumble Season 2 brings Endeavor to the fight appeared first on Destructoid.",

Until then, you can get your SH on by downloading this mod for Resident Evil 4, which brings Konami's world into Capcom's.\n\n\nNexus Mods user AmanoSomething has imported some of the outfits from the original Silent Hill game into the remake of RE4. According to the images and the mod description, you can now dress Leon Kennedy up as Harry Mason.\n\n\nImage via AmanoSomething/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nThere's also a costume for Ada Wong that makes her look like police officer Cybil Bennett, two costumes for Ashley (Lisa Garland and Alessa Gillespie), and Luis can now dress up as Dr. Michael Kaufmann. Even Lord Saddler gets the Silent Hill treatment with a Dahlia Gillespie recolor.\n\n\nTwo worlds combine\n\n\nWe still have no idea when Konami plans to release Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2. The Steam page still has it down as \"coming soon\" and while many weren't thinking it would be out in time for Halloween, a lot of us were assuming 2023 would be a potential release window.\n\n\nHowever, with December just around the corner and the game nowhere in sight yet, you'd be forgiven for assuming you won't find it under the Christmas tree this year.\n\n\nWhile Silent Hill: Ascension has been something of a letdown for many, seeing SH2 making a comeback will keep fans going. However, given that the original 2001 release has gone down as one of the greatest survival horror games of all time, doing a successful remake of it is a pretty tall order.\n\nThe post Resident Evil 4 meets Silent Hill in this custom mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'll be honest, Lethal Company can be a pretty scary experience. The last thing I think I'd want is to see my head turned like a screw in virtual reality. But if that sounds just peachy, you may be interested in a Lethal Company VR mod.\n\n\nThe mod is currently in development, but there's been enough done for a short video demonstration. Twitter/X user Flat2VR shared some footage of the current build of the mod, which is under development by \"DaXcess / rodabafilms.\" At first blush, it looks about as typical as you can get for VR. Looking around corners and up stairwells is as effortless as moving your own head. It's the kind of freedom is something I'd find pretty welcome in a game where giant Bunker Spiders lurk in dark places. And that's pretty much everywhere.\n\n\nImage via Flat2VR\n\n\nLethal Company VR mod currently doesn't have a release window as of yet\n\n\nWith Lethal Company only about a month old, a VR mod for it will still likely take a bit of time. Still, the footage shared by Flat2VR is looking solid. As an occasional VR player myself, there isn't much that stands out to me as a problem. Of course, we don't see any examples of dealing with enemies or leaping over ledges. Many VR games also allow you to set head height and teleportation or blink movement to help with nausea, all of which may be in the works. Either way, having played Phasmophobia via VR in the past, all I can say is that it'll easily make Lethal Company all the scarier. As if that was ever needed.\n\n\nLethal Company is a horror game at its heart, and quite difficult as well.

A post from Twitter user Gabe Follower shows a brief clip from it, with a comment saying that it didn't take long for the community to work out how to play it.\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, a video from the YouTube channel ilovethevopo not only showed gameplay footage from this Left 4 Dead prototype, but made it available for download.\n\n\nThe basic pieces are all there\n\n\nAs you can see, it looks and plays like Counter-Strike, but with the addition of \"zombies\" as the player moves around the map. In Gabe Follower's clip, when the player places the bomb down on the target, we hear the familiar Left 4 Dead zombie howl before they're set upon.\n\n\nDuring development, L4D was intended as a versus game, but some feedback from Gabe Newell and others at Valve soon saw it change into what we know today. Of course, versus mode is still there, but its four player co-operative mode was what made it stand out.\n\n\nThe game turned 15 recently and is still held aloft as one of history's greatest zombie shoot-em-ups. While the likes of Back 4 Blood attempted to revive the dormant series by offering a spiritual successor, in the end it couldn't quite match up to what Left 4 Dead fans were hoping for. \n\nThe post Valve leaks Left 4 Dead prototype via a Counter-Strike update appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s the exciting and slightly frightening premise behind Task Force Admiral Vol. 1: American Carrier Battles, an upcoming naval RTS from famed sim publisher Microprose. \n\n\nIt plunges you into the heart of the post-Pearl Harbour Pacific theatre as a U.S. Fleet Commander, up against a formidable Japanese naval force. Switch from a top-down perspective to a full 3D view and watch each meticulously researched unit take to the air as you lead your carrier group to victory. \n\n\nOr not, because while battles are ripped right out of history, Task Force Admiral Vol. 1’s AI will give you a run for your money. Pause the action if you need thinking time but if, in your folly, you’ve left your own carrier exposed, you’ll have a frantic, fearful rush to defend it before you meet a watery demise. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are definite shades of MicroProse’s own Carrier Command, one of many reasons we’re hyped for this game. Developer Drydock Dreams Game’s infectious passion is another; Task Force Admiral vol.1 exists because they were sick of waiting for someone else to make it. \nIf you’ve the slightest interest in naval combat or WWII history this absolutely needs to be on your radar. \n\n\nAdd Task Force Admiral vol.1: American Carrier Battles to your Steam Wishlist now.\n\n\n\nThe post Task Force Admiral Vol. 1: American Carrier Battles is shaping up to be a naval wargamer’s dream. appeared first on Destructoid.",

These options aren't available solely for aesthetic reasons, as the gear you throw on will affect your bird's performance in Chocobo races. \n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with IGN, director Naoki Hamaguchi explained a bit more about what you can expect from Chocobos in FF7 Rebirth. There's no Chocobo breeding this time around, though there's still plenty to do with the birds. Hamaguchi revealed that you'll get to enjoy an \"enhanced new Chocobo capturing feature\" to acquire the birds that you can then use for traversal. \n\n\nHe also spoke about the Chocobo races, highlighting that there will be several different tracks and varied courses available. Hence, you'll be able to spend hours just racing the birds. Though all Final Fantasy numbered titles are mostly self-contained, some recurring elements are present in several games, including Chocobos. They have been depicted in different ways, though they're always adorable. \n\n\nYou'll get to enjoy the big birds once again when Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches on February 29, 2024, on PS5. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will let you customize your Chocobo appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "An arcade fighting classic of the '90s is about to return to game centers in Japan. Sega announced an updated version of Virtua Fighter 3tb, which is set to debut on November 28. \n\n\nThe new arcade iteration is, appropriately enough, titled Virtua Fighter 3tb Online (via Gematsu). On top of updated balancing and new skills, the meat of this version is the addition of online battles. \n\n\nThanks to Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown's technology, 3tb Online lets players take on others throughout Japan. Players can also put their names and records on display and edit and view them on the official website with the use of Aime cards. \n\n\n\n\nWhat is Virtua Fighter 3tb?\n\n\nVirtua Fighter fans in Japan got their first crack at Virtua Fighter 3tb when it made its arcade debut back in September 1997, a little over a year after Virtua Fighter 3 launched. Like the Online addition to the new version, the tb in the title is pretty straightforward. It refers to the three-on-three team battle mode that served as the arcade update's default state. \n\n\nA flashback to those halcyon arcade days serves as the introduction to the new trailer. The preview also showcases the aforementioned Aime card compatibility before rolling into some of the soundtrack options and flashing through the playable roster, from Akira to Jeffry McWild. \n\n\nThe whole thing looks like a treat for fans of the earlier entries in Sega's long-running series, but for now, it's a Japan-only delight. There is currently no announcement as to whether Virtua Fighter 3tb will make its way outside of Japan or to home consoles. \n\nThe post Virtua Fighter 3tb Online brings the fight back to arcades appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There will almost certainly never be an end to the sheer number of things Doom can be ported to, but earrings are a new one. We've already reached the point where Doom was running inside Doom in some weird Inception-style melding (is that a dated reference?). Now, someone has managed to combine the iconic FPS with fashion.\n\n\nStreamer, \"self-taught dev,\" and Twitter user Alina has posted a short clip of herself wearing a pair of Game Boy-inspired earrings. Only these earrings can be seen playing a dinky version of id Software's classic shooter, Doom.\n\n\n\n\nThis came about not long after Alina posted a tweet about how said earrings can actually be programmed to play Tetris on them. Soon after, user @zKassaiAudio set things in motion by predicting that someone would run Doom on the earrings, which is exactly what happened.\n\n\nCan I get a pair?\n\n\nLooking at some additional Twitter/X posts, Alina says she's using the Thumby keychain. This is a tiny gaming device from a company called TinyCircuits, which has been designed after the Nintendo Game Boy.\n\n\nGiven that the Thumby is programmable, it's feasible for anyone with coding skills to put a micro version of Doom on there. As for the earrings, they'll need to be bought separately. It might seem like a gimmick, but it'll give you something to play when your phone's out of signal.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, well, Doom officially turns 30 years old next month. That's longer than some people reading this have been alive. It begs the question of how id (and the fans) will be celebrating its legacy. Doom fashion accessories seem like a good start.\n\nThe post You can now play classic Doom…on some earrings appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, Valve not only released a documentary about the iconic FPS, but also sent out a pretty significant update to celebrate. While the Half-Life patch brought with it some bug fixes, there was one that it didn't manage to iron out. Until now, that is.\n\n\nIn a short clip uploaded to Twitter/X by user @VinciusMedeiro6, another update that rolled out recently has fixed an issue with the Blast Pit chapter of the game. Anyone who's familiar with Half-Life will be familiar with this section, and the bug in question concerns an unlucky scientist.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Gordon Freeman steps into a control room, a giant, tentacled monster crashes through a window and grabs a panicked, lab coat-wearing NPC. Unfortunately, perhaps due to limitations at the time, the boffin is dragged off by the monster, but the off animation makes it seem like he's floating in midair.\n\n\nArgh! A flying scientist!\n\n\nThis little immersion-breaking hiccup has been part and parcel of Half-Life for the past 25 years. Even the big anniversary update didn't fix it. But now, it seems Valve saw fit to finally give this small (but wholly iconic) cutscene some additional care.\n\n\nYou can see the result in the clip posted above. For a comparison, @VinciusMedeiro6 also uploaded the original. This way, you can really see the difference this little tweak has made to what must have been a terrifying ordeal for the bespectacled scientist.\n\n\nSince turning a quarter of a century old, Half-Life has enjoyed something of a resurgence, reaching its highest-ever player peak, even without fixing this bug. It sort of cements just how significant the release was (and still is), both in the FPS genre and in gaming in general.\n\nThe post A Half-Life bug that went unchecked for a quarter of a century finally gets fixed appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.\nThe film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). \nFive Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. \nFNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME. Just passed SPLIT. thanks to Emma Tammi, Scott Cawthon, cast & the New Orleans crew, the Henson team, & our partners @universalpics & @peacock. @jhutch1992, @matthewlillard, @Piperrubios, @elizethdlail\nNovember 27, 2023\n\n\nFirst announced in 2015 (roughly a year after the first game’s release), Five Nights At Freddy’s stars Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games series) with actors such as Elizabeth Lail and Matthew Lillard in supporting roles. The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us. \nFor more on Blumhouse, read about how the production company is creating a video game development and publishing studio. \nDid you watch Five Nights At Freddy’s?

A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles.

          "description": "It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.\nIt all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.\nIn free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…",

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?\nAnd that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.\nHere's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.\n  \nKazooie (4/10)\nfrom Banjo Kazooie\nKazooie doesn't look activel…",

As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. \nHowever, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best.

And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. \nThe Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. \n\"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2,\" Epic writes in a blog post. \"Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET.\"\nWhile waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite. \nAre you hopping into Fortnite's Big Bang event next month?

Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too. \nAre you going to pick up Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.",

The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however).

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
