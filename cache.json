Microsoft has been making shock moves such as launching the process to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and Sony recently hoovered up Halo and Destiny creators Bungie for $3.6 billion. There's plenty of speculation that major moves like this will continue, and some fans are cheerleading from the sidelines.\n\nSoapbox: Don't Cheer For Corporate Takeovers - It's Not A Game\n\nThere's been lots of chatter around which studios and companies could be well placed for potential takeovers, and PlatinumGames has certainly been mentioned. So far the major moves of Microsoft and Sony have focused on US-based companies, with business culture and legal factors making similar moves in Japan less prominent to date (though mergers between Japanese companies have happened, with famous examples like Square Enix and Bandai Namco).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We've tried whenever possible in the past to retrospectively right this wrong, and today, we're looking to shed a little light on Kharon's Crypt - Even Death May Die, an utterly fantastic retro-style adventure that looks like a gothic, Dark Souls-inspired take on Zelda but has plenty of unique ideas of its own.\nFirst up, those visuals. The team behind the game has clearly opted for a Game Boy Color look for this one; while we doubt a real GBC could achieve some of the fancier visual effects, it's still brilliantly authentic. The Zelda vibe is clear to see, too – from the way the dungeons are rendered to the map screen and visually-similar inventory management, it really does feel like you're playing a dark, sinister take on Nintendo's famous series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Time for new hits to take the lead.\nIn its Q3 financial results at the start of February Nintendo confirmed that it was increasing its forecast for software sales over the year from 200 million to 220 million units. While the runaway early success of Pokémon Legends: Arceus is certainly a factor in that, 'evergreen' older titles are still contributing many millions of sales each year, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the prime example (to the point it now has a new two year DLC roll-out on the way).\nAsked about the trend in an investor Q & A, however, company President Shuntaro Furukawa highlighted the impressive ongoing sales of 'evergreen' games but made it clear that this likely won't be sustainable in the coming years for the Switch. This'll be a natural evolution as the system's generation enters its latter years; with less 'new' owners picking up the system there'll be an equivalent drop in those picking up the highly rated and essential older titles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Under Siege.\nKoei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series has followed much the same rhythm of releases since way back in the early noughties, with each mainline entry in the franchise since 2003's Dynasty Warriors 4 followed by both an Xtreme and Empires spin-off, the latter of which adds a little bit of strategic tinkering to the usual Musou mix. It's nothing particularly complex, for sure, but as fans of this genre we always look forward to the arrival of a new Empires variant as it gives these hack-and-slash action-fests a little more in the way of depth and replayability.\nDynasty Warriors 9: Empires is the very first Empires game to hit Switch, and only the second Dynasty Warriors proper to arrive on Nintendo's console, following on from 2018's thoroughly decent Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. We've been excited to get our hands on this one, then, eager to jump into some all-conquering action, cutting swathes through screenfuls of enemies whilst expanding our empire across the length and breadth of China.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Way too obvious.\nNot content with finally getting seminal Build engine classic Blood back on digital storefronts (Switch port, please!), as well as the first two Turoks, Doom 64, Quake and Shadow Man, Nightdive Studios have finally got Ancient Egyptian FPS Powerslave (known in the UK as Exhumed) out of its sarcophagus and re-released it as the perfectly-named Powerslave Exhumed, finally giving modern gamers a chance to enjoy this tremendous little gem of a game.\nUnusually, this is one boomer shooter from that’s best-known for its home console editions rather than the almost entirely different PC title. Home computer folks had to put up with a much less interesting, far more linear take on the game. Annoyingly, though, while both the Saturn (1996) and PlayStation (1997) versions offered a far superior title, they each had something to offer in their varying level designs.

          "description": "Total War: Warhammer 3 is an extremely hard game to review in isolation. It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.\r\n\n\r\nWhile it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.\nRead more",

While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9.

Yeah\", with that final \"yeah\" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.\nThe game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions.

Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.\nIn the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.\nRead more",

It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.\nPerhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.\nRead more",

No, probably not.\nWe discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus!

It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Thus began America's Army, a series of tactical first-person shooters funded and released for free by the Army as a recruitment tool. But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds. Official servers will shut down in May, though offline bits and privately owned servers will remain playable.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. \nFor example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.\nRead more",

          "description": "Death's Door is a great little game. I've been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there's only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)\nReader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.\nRead more",

It's tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you'd think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.\nThat's right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad.

Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.\nRead more",

Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.\r\n\n\r\nThe first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.\r\n\n \nRead more",

After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.\nA streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of \"best of\" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.\nRead more",

This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it's the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game's textures and models with high-def versions, they've tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.\nRead more",

Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. \nUsing 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. \nUpdate 2/14: The following superstars have been confirmed: Dakota Kai, Elias, Io Shirai, Jinder Mahal, Lacey Evans, Mandy Rose, Mansoor, Pete Dunne, and Roddy Piper. \nThe confirmed roster so far: \nAJ Styles\nDakota Kai\nKane\nSami Zayn\nNote: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.\nWWE 2K22 launches March 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Uncharted arrives in theaters on February 18, but if you’d rather read the cinematic adaptation instead, a novelization of the film releases tomorrow. And if you’d rather listen to your books based on blockbuster films based on triple-A video games, Variety reports that the audiobook version has an added dose of authenticity since it’ll be narrated by the original Nathan Drake himself, Nolan North. \nUncharted: The Official Movie Novelization goes on sale on February 15 and puts the exploits of Tom Holland's Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's Victor “Sully” Sullivan from screen to page. The book is written by sci-fi and horror author S.D. Perry, who previously penned a series of books based on Resident Evil, Alien, Star Trek, and other properties. North, who brought Nathan Drake to life throughout the Uncharted video game series, will lend his talent to the film’s younger spin on the hero. Per Variety, North says he won’t be imitating Holland’s performance one-to-one, saying “I kind of just did me. I tried to young him up a little bit.” North also provides his spins on Walhberg’s Sully as well as its other characters including Antonio Banderas' villain, Moncada.  \nNow that we're a week away from the film premiere, you can whet your appetite by watching Uncharted's airplane scene in its entirety here. You can also read about how the movie's director has his sights on Jak & Daxter for his next project here. Lastly, be sure to check out our new season of our Video Gameography podcast which provides a deep dive into the making and storytelling of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. \n[Source: Variety]",

Most trailers have been about specific things within the sequel, such as salvage contracts and challenges, or new looks at gameplay running on different PlayStation consoles. Today’s trailer, however, is the most cinematic look we’ve received of Forbidden West yet and you can watch it below: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer, it shows Aloy’s journey across the Forbidden West. It starts in somewhat familiar territory before we see Aloy encounter some vicious dinosaur machines. We then get a new look at swimming mechanics in Forbidden West as well as a glimpse at a fight against one of the game’s new Elephant machines. Throughout the entire journey, Aloy narrates what is her biggest hunt – unknown to us at the moment – that takes her to the Forbidden West. \nIt’s a great trailer and certainly one worth watching if you’re excited about this sequel. After watching it, watch this “Meet the Cast” of Horizon Forbidden West trailer and then read about how Guerrilla Games is taking Aloy to new places in Horizon Forbidden West. Check out this story about how Horizon Zero Dawn has surpassed 20 million copies sold, just a week before the release of Horizon Forbidden West, after that. \nAre you excited for Horizon Forbidden West?

Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline entries in Naughty Dog's blockbuster action series, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  \nDeveloped by Naughty Dog, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console. Released on November 19, 2007, Uncharted brought Naughty Dog into a bold new era of \"mature\" game development. In this week's episode, we talk about Naughty Dog's history developing titles like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, how the studio was largely unprepared for the challenges of Uncharted's development. We also talk about how Naughty Dog almost designed a game similar to BioShock, how Johnny Knoxville served as inspiration for Nathan Drake, and how Gears of War's release changed Uncharted's design for the better. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and ex-Game Informer editor and host of the CrossFade podcast Matt Helgeson (@MattHelgeson) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's video game debut.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "The first Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion of 2022 is finally ready to launch, and as such, we're here to crack open a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. The expansion includes more 170 cards, including 4 Pokémon VStar cards, 20 Pokémon V, and 3 Pokémon VMax cards. In addition, Brilliant Stars features 30 Trainer Gallery cards with special art, more than 20 Trainer cards, and a new Special Energy card.\nWe were sent a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. When I opened up all the packs and sorted through my pulls, I was pleased with the generational spread. While Kanto and Galar Pokémon continue to be well-represented, I noticed more Sinnoh monsters this time around. With Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl hitting just last year, and Legends: Arceus launching last month, this feels like a smart move.\nMy favorite cards this time around happen to fall into the Gen I category. While it's true I hold Gen I in the highest regard (thanks mostly to nostalgia), I like to think that these cards are my favorites not because of that nostalgia, but instead due to the classic-facing designs of these full-art cards. The clean art of the Pikachu V and Raichu V cards immediately caught my eye, and I always consider it a great day when I can pull a Charizard. Of course, having just put a ton of hours into Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it was cool to also pull the titular Pocket Monster from these packs. I also really like some of the Trainer cards included in this expansion, which is not something I can say about every set.\nYou can see the more than 20 cards I deemed my favorites in the gallery below.\nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars launches on February 25.

Nostalgia for games like that helps them a lot in many cases, but that only gets you so far – at the end of the day, you do actually need to create a great game when attempting to dig back into the treasure chest that is 8-bit and 16-bit action-adventure gameplay. I'm happy to report that Berzerk Studio's Infernax, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on February 14, has been a blast so far. \nWhile I've not completed the game just yet, there's plenty within that I want to keep a secret for yourself to view in the full game. However, if you've not heard of Infernax or are looking for more information about it, we have you covered with the first 15 minutes of the game (and if you're anything like me, these first 15 minutes will sell you on the game quite well). \nIn this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc, Ben Reeves, and Marcus Stewart talk and walk you through the first 15 minutes of Infernax.

          "description": "Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has expectedly led to back-and-forth discourse about the likelihood of exclusivity. In response, Head of Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed that popular titles like Call of Duty would remain multiplatform. However, at the end of that same statement, Spencer briefly voiced Microsoft's interest \"in taking similar steps to support Nintendo's successful platform.\" While this leaves room for interpretation, a recent CNBC interview doubles down on Spencer's final remarks meaning Microsoft might bring Call of Duty to Switch. \nIt is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on \"violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws,\" specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.\n\nAccording to a Eurogamer report, Microsoft's President Brad Smith told CNBC, \"We'd like to bring [Call of Duty] to Nintendo devices. We'd like to bring the other popular titles that Activision Blizzard has, and ensure that they continue to be available on PlayStation, [and] that they become available on Nintendo.\" Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that future or current Call of Duty games will be developed with the Switch in mind. Still, Spencer and Smith's words might indicate a future where Call of Duty is readily available on every platform. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nWould you dive right in if Call of Duty was ported to Switch?

If you already have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion membership, you’ll get instant access to the Booster Course Pass when the first wave is available in a few months. You can also pre-order it for $25.\nWe loved Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as much as its dedicated fandom. Brian Shea concluded his review by saying: \n“Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is primarily a re-release of an acclaimed game from three years ago, but by adding new content and addressing the biggest complaint of the original, this version is unquestionably the best way to experience Nintendo's great racer.

That compilation disc included five rudimentary sports titles and showed players the capabilities of the Wii's then-groundbreaking motion controls. It was an immediate smash hit, attracting demographics that extended far beyond Nintendo's typical gaming audience. However, while the Nintendo Switch has now outsold the wildly popular Wii and it has its fair share of wide-reaching smash hits like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the console/handheld hybrid hasn't had another transcendent game experience like the original Wii Sports. Now, with the aptly named Nintendo Switch Sports, fans of Wii Sports can relive past glories.\nNintendo Switch Sports gathers six sports and lets you control them using the motion controls of the Switch Joy-Cons. Tennis, bowling, and chambara (swordplay) all return to the Sports series, while this iteration adds soccer, volleyball, and badminton. If you buy the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports, you also receive a Leg Strap accessory that allows your Joy-Con to track your leg, which can be used in soccer's Shootout Mode.\nYou can play in-person with family and friends like the original Wii Sports or play online in ranked matchmaking or against friends on your Nintendo Switch Online list. Two free updates were also announced for Nintendo Switch Sports. The first one, coming this summer, adds the ability to use the Leg Strap peripheral for the main game of soccer. This fall, another free update will add golf to the collection of sports you can play.\nNintendo Switch Sports arrives on Switch on April 29. If you'd like to check it out before then, Nintendo is hosting a special online play test from February 18 to 20, where Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can play bowling, chambara, and tennis.",

Nintendo announced the SNES classic Earthbound is finally making its way to Switch, and its NES prequel dubbed Earthbound Beginnings will be joining it.\nEarthbound will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online SNES collection, being added to the service for no additional cost. Likewise, Earthbound Beginnings will become a new part of the Switch's NES collection. \nFor those unfamiliar with Earthbound, it's a 1994 JRPG that follows a small-town boy named Ness who is tasked by a time-traveling bee to save the world from an alien invasion. Along his travels across the globe, he meets plenty of strange characters and forms a party with three other very capable children. In Japan, it's known as Mother 2, although it's the first of the series that made its way stateside.\nEarthbound Beginnings is the original Mother title that didn't see release outside of Japan for 16 years. The 1989 JRPG was localized and released on Wii U in 2015. Like Earthbound, you play as a seemingly normal kid named Ninten with psychic powers who goes on a strange adventure. This is the second time Earthbound Beginnings has been made available, skipping release on 3DS and the NES Classic.\nHopefully, the release of these absolute classics will open the door for Mother 3 to see the light of day outside of Japan in some way.

This dastardly option makes it so that taking a single hit means instant death. Rookie Mode, on the other hand, increases the amount of health Samus' replenishes when picking up restorative items. The update goes live later today (with the free demo getting updated to include it), so you can download it soon if Dread is kicking your butt or not making you sweat enough. \nNintendo also announced that a Boss Rush mode, where you battle bosses continually one after another, will arrive via a second update sometime in April. \nFor more on Metroid Dread, check out our review. Does either mode appeal to you? Let us know in the comments!",

The 1994 Super Famicom game was developed by Square and has never been officially released outside of Japan, making this a welcomed development for JRPG aficionados.\nLive A Live is getting an Octopath Traveler-style facelift, sporting the same HD-2D art direction. The game stars eight heroes and is told through eight scenarios set during different time periods such as prehistory, imperial China, the Wild West, the distant future, and more. You tackle these stories in any order, and each sports a unique gameplay hook, such as stealth or telepathy. Live A Live launches for Switch on July 22.\nClick here to watch embedded media",

Players can experience the game all the way until the end of chapter 3 during this demo. Probably even more relevant, progress from this demo is going to carry over into the full release!\nSo if you want to try out some classes and see how they perform in battle or flit around with different story strategies as to what nation you're trying to help or hinder, this is the time. Or you could just try to get a super overpowered class composition and be ready for launch. You do you, ya know? Oh, and for those that haven't played, this is a good chance to see what the game is all about!",
