          "description": "Sleep well.\nIn 2017, Bedtime Digital Games released Figment, a cute and dreamlike action puzzle game that aimed to be a little more ambitious and expansive than their debut release, Back to Bed. We enjoyed it, and evidently plenty of other people did, too, as the studio has now brought us Figment 2: Creed Valley. Though Figment 2 feels like more of the same, it nonetheless offers up an enjoyable and engaging puzzle experience that we feel is worth your time, although perhaps less so on Switch.\nFigment 2 borrows from the playbook of Pixar’s Inside Out by placing you in a fictionalized world within an ordinary person’s mind, where various abstract concepts like compassion or opinions are represented by tangible objects and characters. The narrative primarily follows Dusty, the embodiment of the mind’s courage, and his bird friend, Piper, as they work to fix the moral compass of a father struggling to balance his family’s emotional needs with his own sense of what he should be prioritizing as a provider. Dusty and Piper must fend off evil Nightmares that threaten to upset the balance of this man’s mind, all while trying to make their way through the whimsical and sprawling land of the eponymous Creed Valley.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.\nIn 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.\nRead more",

They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. \nOverall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing. \nRead more",

Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).\nFigment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.\nRead more",

An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It's from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.\nRead more",

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake.

          "description": "As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.\nLast week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.\nRead more",

I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. \nIn the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. \"Arrow to the knee\" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, \"Get a hold of yourself you buffoon\".\nI got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the lead-up to the original Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, the team at Ninja Theory released 30 development diaries, delving deep into every aspect of the game: the art inspirations, the myths they were remixing, and more. It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Secondly, you should know that Immortal Empires is, as far as Total War: Warhammer goes, the game mode.

          "description": "A new Half-Life mod adds raytracing to Valve's venerable first-person shooter, a shiny slap of 2023 lighting technology in a 1998 game. I normally think such anachronistic upgrades look awful but this one works for me. Rather than just slam fancy modern tech into an old game, the mod wants to change the whole look. And it succeeds in a surprising way: by making the rest of Half-Life look older.\nRead more",

I'm not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it'll be ready in 2024. Hopefully. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that's basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that's true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.\nRead more",

That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you. \r\n\n \nRead more",

V datovém centru se do dvou sálů vejde přes 200 serverových racků, každý s příkonem až do 15 kW. Designem jsme cílili především na umístnění serverů, které si už nějakou dobu sami vyvíjíme a sestavujeme. Další inovací bude využití přímého freecoolingu pro chlazení serverů. Díky velké podzemní nádrži využijeme v létě k chlazení dešťovou vodu. Celkově tedy v maximální míře chladíme přímým venkovním vzduchem prohnaným přes filtry a případně upraveným na požadovanou vlhkost v limitních stavech. To nám dovolí zcela vynechat strojové chlazení,“ říká Vlastimil Pečínka, technický ředitel ve společnosti Seznam.cz.",

A key element why Kingdom Hearts resonates with so many people is not just the non-stop action; but the passion behind the cast's motivations.\nCharacters like Sora and Roxas aren't afraid to express their emotions: to cry, to scream, to love, to smile. And many of the legendary series characters are more intriguing than the average RPG cast, and it's refreshing to see heroes, (or in some rare cases, villains), that we are able to relate to.\nWarning: There are spoilers for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Kingdom Hearts 3: Remind in this list.\n[caption id=\"attachment_367229\" align=\"alig…",

          "description": "Show me your (new) moves\nThese streets never sleep. Or at least, the Streets of Rage never do. Streets of Rage 4 just got a massive free update, adding a custom survival mode, new co-op moves, character balancing, and more.\nCo-developers DotEmu, Lizardcube, and Guard Crush Games released the new update on Friday. In it, the crew says, are over 300 improvements to 2020's Streets of Rage 4. I've looked at the list, and it's massive, including character balancing changes across the cast of this beat 'em up.\nOne of the big bullet points is the new custom survival mode. This will let players tweak their survival mode experience to their liking, with slides and boxes for starting level, healing, weapons, hazards, enemy scaling, and more. You can get a glimpse of the options in this new trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBCJUijhdM\nAnother big one is a new co-op attack, where you can pick up and throw your partner for a special strike. It's like a tag-team wrestling attack, only their fists are on fire. The update is live now for all Streets of Rage 4 owners.\nFists of fury\nIf you don't happen to own Streets of Rage 4 yet, this weekend may be a good time to address that. There's currently a sale across the Steam store, PlayStation Store, and Nintendo eShop. The Mr. X Nightmare DLC is also discounted too, and there's a bundle on Steam.\nBasically, there's a lot of good reasons to play Streets of Rage 4. The most important one, though, is that it's a very, very good game. I have some fond memories running through this, both solo and co-op, and it's great to see this franchise revival still getting updates years later. Though there have been many other brawlers and beat 'em ups since, I always enjoy an excuse to jump back into Streets of Rage.\nThe post Streets of Rage 4 gets free update with custom survival mode and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get ready\nIf someone told me they were creating a new OutRun with 3D graphics, I’d be extremely skeptical. OutRun was not merely a raster racer through and through, it’s the God-empress of raster racers. I would think that adding some depth to that would hurt the appeal. Not so, because OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast is about as faithful as I could imagine.\nTo be clear, OutRun 2006 is sort of the sequel to the sequel. OutRun 2 was released in arcades in 2003, and followed up with a port to Xbox in 2004. Afterwards, OutRun SP was released in 2004 as an upgrade to OutRun 2. OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast is a console (and PSP) combination of the two titles. It is the ultimate version, and I have no idea why it hasn’t been ported since. Probably the Ferrari license. It’s always licensing.\n[caption id…",

Square Enix is one of the few monolithic publishers that doesn’t shy away from mid-budget releases, but Paranormasight seems like such a small project that it’s surprising to see it outside of the indie sphere.\nIt's a visual novel.

Arcades, bars, clubs, laundries, restaurants, theaters, corner stores, and gyms. If there was a five-foot footprint empty, then it had a pinball machine plonked on it.\nThere have been thousands of machines produced since the 1930s, from coin-operated bagatelle tables, through to the delightful electromagnetic (EM) machines of the '50s-'70s, these would give way to the Solid State (SS) machines of the '80s, pinball's golden renaissance in …",

Alongside a detailed look at an upcoming Bowser-centric set, Lego also teased that Donkey Kong will be making his Lego Super Mario debut this summer.\nAt the close of the stream, we get a good look at the Lego Donkey Kong build, which has a little spot for the Lego Super Mario figure to sit in. It's an interesting configuration, considering I don't remember Mario ever riding on Donkey Kong's back? Maybe I'm forgetting some weird outtake of the 1986 animation or something.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L8qJUwZ94A\nWe didn't get any more indication of what Lego Donkey Kong's set may entail. I'm personally hoping for some sort of chaotic mine cart course, and tons of little Lego bananas to scatter around.\nBowser's new brick castle\nToday's spotlight also featured a good look at the Dry Bowser castle set, which is currently aimed for release on August 1 with a $109.99 price tag. I do like the Dry version of Bowser, but I love all the little details here. A bony Piranha Plant, the chain links and giant Bowser visage, and yes, even the Toad trapped in a cage.\n[caption id=\"attachment_368255\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Lego[/caption]\nThe Lego Super Mario crossover has really taken off in the past few years, with tons of sets coming out of the partnership between Nintendo and Lego. Ranging from these playsets designed like game levels to the enormous, gorgeous Question Block set, it's pretty cool seeing the notorious plumber reimagined in brick form.\nAnd if that doesn't satisfy your Mario craving, there's at least a feature film arriving soon to handle that too. The latest and final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie premiered yesterday, strangely one day prior to March 10.\nThe post Donkey Kong is joining the Lego Super Mario lineup this summer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Names become Numbers\nAs part of yesterday's Nacon Connect live stream, the French publisher released a new trailer for its affecting and intense-looking release, War Hospital, which is currently in development for PC and consoles.\nDeveloped by indie outfit Brave Lamb Studios, War Hospital is a harsh management simulator that will afford the player the unenviable task of attempting to build, run, and maintain makeshift medical facilities in the throes of World War One. As a British combat medic on the French frontline, with an almost hopeless situation at hand, it is the player's task to ensure that wounded soldiers are able to receive the care needed to keep them alive, standing, and ultimately, returning to the fight.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unLUFJFvOt0&ab_channel=Nacon\nUnderstaffed and undersupplied, massively difficult matters of efficiency and pragmatism will need to be tackled in order to ensure maximum survivability rate for a constant influx of patients. Research and develop new fields of medicine and healing, build extended wards and theaters within earshot of battle, and, when the war gets a little too close for comfort, be prepared to venture into the field in a desperate search for resources, and face the consequences of desperate, necessary actions.\nWhile War Hospital certainly doesn't look to have the jolly, low-stakes nature of similar titles such as Theme Hospital and Two Point Hospital, the trailer above showcases a meticulously designed and stylishly presented example of the hospital sim genre. While certainly not a title for the weak of heart and nerve, War Hospital looks very promising, and worth watching for those willing to tip the ultimate scales of life and death.\nWar Hospital launches later this year on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Survival is a rarely affordable privilege in War Hospital appeared first on Destructoid.",

As of a recent update, the app appears to be leaning a little closer to the \"free\" side of that portmanteau than before.\nThe 3.0.27 update, released as part of an advertising push for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, allows players to play one stage every day for free. You can play that one stage as many times as you'd like during that one-day window, but once that window is over, the stage will be locked again.\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BPTrwu8pn4[/embed]\nStill not fully free\nYou still can't play all of Super Mario Run unless you fork over a few dollars. Only one level will be available per day, and not every level will become available during the event. The event also only runs until May 31, so this isn't a permanent change to the Super Mario Run model. Still, it's the biggest chunk of content that's ever been available for non-paying players.\nNormally, only the first world, the Toad Rally mode, and the Remix 10 mode are available for free in Super Mario Run. All of those offerings are, of course, still available for free in addition to the daily free stages. For the duration of the event, you'll also be able to unlock the rest of the worlds without time-gated restrictions at a discounted rate.

Outlast studio Red Barrels confirms that The Outlast Trials is going into Early Access on May 18, 2023.\nThe Early Access launch will go up on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, though pricing has not been announced as of this writing. While Red Barrels has hosted a closed beta already, this will be the chance for many more players to hop in and try out the new Outlast for themselves.\nYou can check out a new trailer below, which focuses a little less on the gameplay and more on The Outlast Trials' voice actors and their ability to scream. They're pretty darn good at it!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKwMY4ZBJJ0\nRed Barrels has made a name for itself in the horror genre with the Outlast series. They play almost like a found footage-style experience, where you have to sneak and scurry around while terrors hunt for you.\nOutlast together\nThe difference in The Outlast Trials is that it can be a solo or co-op experience. You and up to three other players get \"involuntarily recruited\" by the Murkoff Corporation to test certain trials, and you can opt to tackle them solo or with your friends.\nYou'll still be hiding, running, and fleeing. But special tools will allow you new ways to sneak around or slow down enemies. There's also character customization options for your chosen trial competitor, too.\nMultiplayer survival horror has been pretty popular, as games like Dead By Daylight and Phasmophobia can attest. I'm sure Outlast fans are probably interested in seeing what Red Barrels does with more players in its horror designs.\nReally, it's just nice to have pals to encounter the scares with you. It certainly softens the scares for the fright-averse out there, in my experience.\nThe Outlast Trials hits Early Access on May 18.

Players choose from one of four races — Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Necrons, and Orks — before engaging in long-form combat in order to hold dominion over the titular world of Gladius. Unlike most 4X titles, there are no \"Diplomacy\" mechanics.\nWell, it's not called Compromisehammer 40K, is it now?\nhttps://youtu.be/aMSsNRkvIMQ\nOn release critics praised the title's adaptation of 4X to the Warhammer universe, as well as the game's action, but specialist press noted that the title failed to truly capture the intricate nature of 4X titles, resulting in a release that was both engaging and enjoyable, but fails to break the upper echelon of more dedicated brands such as Age of Wonders, Alpha Centauri, or Civilization. For Warhammer fans, however, Gladius — Relics of War will certainly scratch that strategic 40K itch.\nWarhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 16-23.

And if you finish the Resident Evil 4 demo and think it was a bit too easy, there's a little extra challenge in the secret \"Mad Chainsaw Mode\" difficulty.\nAs players have been cruising through the early RE4 experience, some have been greeted with a special difficulty mode. I first saw it from the folks over at Eurogamer, but it's been steadily making the rounds on social and more too.\nThe \"Mad Chainsaw Mode\" difficulty in the Resident Evil 4 remake demo is a special run. You only get one life, no respawns. Mad Chainsaw Mode will only be applied to that run, and if you want to run it again, you'll have to make new attempts.\nAdditionally, this mode is specifically for …",

Rewind or Die has you playing as a video rental store worker who finds themselves stalked by a slasher. You’ll work your shift on your own as your co-workers flaked out on you. However, as a slave to an uncaring society, you just need to keep your head down while receiving threatening phone calls.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/bQgOrKAvz0M[/embed]\nI think this is exactly my favorite kind of horror game. The core experience of Stay Out of the House was fantastic, but one of its highlights was its prologue, where you work a gas station night shift, just waiting for the shoe to drop. I also commonly thump the drum of Happy’s Humble Burger Farm, where you serve customers at a fast food joint. Casting the player in a relatable experience is just such a great way to draw them into the game world. Plus, like anyone who grew up in the ‘90s, I have a lot of love for video rental places.\nRewind or Die will launch on April 14 on PC. If you’d like a taste of Comp-3 Interactive’s previous work, you can find them on itch.io.\nThe post Lo-fi horror game Rewind or Die is done asking nicely April 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The digital funland will open in June and is a celebration of the veteran studio's legacy of games and franchises.\nVery little has been offered in the way of details, but Capcom Town will feature \"a digital museum and other buildings\" which one would assume will be filled with artwork, marketing materials, write-ups, and trailers from franchises such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and many more. We will likely see areas based on Capcom's arcade roots, hopefully offering nods to titles such as Strider, Side Arms, Gun.Smoke, and maybe even Cadillacs & Dinosaurs... Ok, now I'm just being unrealistic.\nCapcom is genuinely one of the industry greats, and while the past decade has certainly seen the studio stumble on more than one occasion, the developer seems to have been back on track since the 2018 launch of Monster Hunter World, which has led to a string of quality, successful releases. And with Resident Evil 4 and Street Fighter 6 on deck for this year, it looks like Capcom will have plenty to celebrate come its June anniversary.\nCapcom Town will have a grand opening on June 13, 2023.

And in order to get your celebration for the beloved plumber and his amazing adventures off to a grand start, Illumination has received the \"final\" trailer for its upcoming release The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which launches in a little under a month from now.\nThe trailer, (which honestly perhaps shows a little too much for my liking), sees Mario's brother Luigi imprisoned within Bowser's Castle (complete with a great remix of the area's classic theme). Mario teams up with notable heroes such as Princess Peach and Toad in order to rescue Luigi, defeat the mighty monarch's army, and restore peace to the Mushroom Kingdom. The trailer ends with a battle sequence on the Rainbow Road, with Mario bustin' out his finest karting abilities.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdD9geN6erk&ab_channel=UniversalPicturesUK\nLook, I get it. Illumination only has one form of comedy — the collar-tugging, record-scratching, \"oh no he did'n\" deal. Yeah, it's trite, overdone, and cynical. But, despite all that, I can't help but think that this film looks pretty marvelous. From a visual perspective, it's a delight, with authentic sounds and music. I also think some of the jokes over the past few trailers have been pretty funny, and some of the casting, (like Jack Black's Bowser), is paying off. Of course, whether this fun and energy can be maintained over 92 minutes remains to be seen, but from what we've seen so far, I'm feeling very positive.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie launches in North American and European theaters on April 5. Don't forget to check out this ace line of posters released to promote the movie.

The HD remaster will bring it all to more modern consoles with single screens, with upgraded visuals and sound. That includes new music arrangements by Great Ace Attorney composer Yasumasa Kitagawa, which are fully synchronized with the original music. The Ghost Trick remaster will even let you flip between the new and original music at will, too.\nAdd on a new gallery of artwork and music for Ghost Trick, and it does seem like the Phantom Detective is getting the historical treatment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ob83jbeJ4Y\nActivate your ghost powers\nIf you've not seen Ghost Trick before, it follows the soul of Sissel, who wakes up to find he's dead. As he unravels the mysteries surrounding his murder, he has to possess and manipulate objects to alter events.\nIt's a quirky, entertaining story with a fair bit of heart. If you dig this era of writing, especially from the Ace Attorney team, this is absolutely one to keep an eye on.\nPre-orders are live now, and Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective hits PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on June 30.\nThe post Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective comes back to life on June 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

An additional fix improves support for various graphics cards, and eliminates an issue that was rendering some resolutions unselectable. On both platforms, minor tweaks allow guest players to skip cutscenes, so you won't be waiting around for your running buddy along with general stability and framerate improvements.\nCheck out the full patch notes in the tweet below. An Xbox edition of the update will launch \"soon\". Team Ninja notes that it will continue to investigate player feedback on the title, with further updates planned for the coming months.

The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. \n\n\nThe Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. \nYou can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.",

Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.\nYou can see the action unfold for yourself below.\n\n\nDeveloper Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since.

Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. \nIn an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: \n“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”\nSo there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  \nResident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. \nAdditionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer. \nWhat do you think of these new updates? Let us know in the comments!",

Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. \nIn a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a \"deep dive\" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. \n\n\nStarfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. \nStarfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.",

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. \nThe first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.",

Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary \"photo mode\" way we are all now familiar with.\nThis episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill.

Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. \nMore specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. \nCheck out the game in action in the new trailer below: \n\n\n\"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,\" a press release reads. \"Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. \n\nThe Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review.

Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.\nThese updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.\nBoth of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms.

          "description": "Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. \nThe collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. \nCheck out the shoes in the gallery below: \n\nEach of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. \nShoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \n[Source: Techraptor]\nWhat do you think of these Final Fantasy XIV shoes?

However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.\nDiving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn't help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop.

          "description": "Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. \nYesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, \"Get Ready For Battle\" and \"A New Sparking Begins\" appear on screen. \nCheck it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below: \n／\n「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ\n#ドラゴンボール #バトルアワー pic.twitter.com/VMMPWWeSUr\nMarch 5, 2023\nAs you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with \"A New Budokai Tenkaichi\" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  \nThe teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review. \nAre you excited for a new Budokai Tenkaichi game?

          "description": "Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. \nThe official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:\nMatsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. \nPerhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.\nIn recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.",

You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.\nThe Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. \n\n\nThis DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, \n“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”\nThis pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. \nPowerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.",

Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. \nThe guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game's six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. \n\n\nDead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.",

For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. \n\"We were already talking about the second game,\" said Asmussen. \"I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game.\" \nAsmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas \"that we could do beyond that as well.\" \nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat. \n[Source: IGN]\nIs Star Wars Jedi: Survivor a day-one pickup for you?

The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.\nThe special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. \nOther big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.\nAre you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch?

          "description": "Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.\nTelltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.\nWith such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. \n\"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it,\" Ottilie tells IGN. \"You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year. \n[Source: IGN]",
