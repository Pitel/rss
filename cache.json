          "description": "Burning rubber.\nHot Wheels, man. We remember those. In the '90s almost every Saturday morning ad break featured a Hot Wheels commercial braying out superlative adjectives over thrashy rock solos. Invariably, two pearly-toothed, spiky-haired kids would grin as their miniature cars jostled for pole position, giving each other a thumbs-up after a totally tubular crash. All we ever wanted was a simple orange loop — because the loop was the coolest gravity-defying thing ever — but we never got one because the Super Nintendo was a life priority. We did manage to try one once, though, and pinged that car down the straight at full speed, ripping up the lip, only for it to soar off and go clattering across the ground. While you can still spectacularly succumb to gravity in Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, if you blast the accelerator for all its worth you’ll coast that loop through an elating 360 degrees.\nHere, the world of collectible racing cars has been virtually recreated in a splendidly inventive fashion. What’s striking about Unleashed 2 is the creativity that’s been put into its various modes, featuring clever ideas that don't just lean on existing tropes, but dig into the fascinating meta of miniature racing within giant, real-world environments.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Do you hear screaming, or am I having another one of my episodes?\".\nA little less than ten years ago, a port of Borderlands 2 famously launched for Sony’s ailing PS Vita to middling reception. The fact that a then-current game could run at all on a portable was remarkable, but the flat visuals, crashing, and consistently sub 30 FPS performance relegated it to more of a novelty than a version that people would be comfortable playing for hours on end. When Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition was announced for the Switch, there was a lot of discourse that history would be repeating itself here, and this wasn’t helped by the general lack of footage leading up to release. Fortunately, any such fears can now be put to rest. Borderlands 3 runs shockingly well on the Switch, bringing over the full, crazy experience in all its glory for portable play.\nBorderlands 3 picks up about seven years after the events of Borderlands 2 and follows the interstellar adventures of familiar Crimson Raiders like Lilith, Claptrap, and Ellie alongside newcomers like Ava and Lorelei. The gang this time around faces off against the Calypso Twins, a godlike sibling duo who have united the bandit clans of Pandora under a cult called the Children of the Vault. Notably, Tyreen Calypso has the ability to leech power from other creatures, and if she’s allowed to absorb the powers of the ancient beasts residing in the Vaults hidden across each planet, she’ll become virtually unstoppable.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking.

Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.\nRead more",

He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. \nAlas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.\nRead more",

It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. \"Lets you play your own Star Trek story\" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.\nRead more",

We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.\nRaise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.\nBut up front it tells you \"There are no wrong choices, only your choices\" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about \"tracing different pathways\" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ara: History Untold's headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. \r\n\n\r\nThis has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  \r\n\n\nTotal War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?\r\n\n\r\nWith the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a \"mixed reality\" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees.

You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.\nClick the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, \"underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool\". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a \"rat god\".\nRead more",

          "description": "“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”\r\n\n\r\nOhlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to \"overstaffing\". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.\r\n\n\r\n\"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,\" reads an official FAQ from the group. \"This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for \"Axis Football 2022\" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.\nAxis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.\nThe result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

However, if you want access to Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. \nThe RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.  \nRead more",

          "description": "At this year’s EVE Fanfest, the annual convention celebrating the 20-year-old space MMO, Icelandic developers CCP announced a new game: EVE Vanguard. A shooter set in their gunmetal grey sci-fi universe, Vanguard puts you into the shoes of mercenaries, dropping onto planets to retrieve equipment from wrecked ships, battling it out with AI-controlled pirates and other squads of human players. It’s Escape from Tarkov by way of the galaxy of New Eden.\r\n\n\r\nIf you’ve followed CCP, you may get a sense of de ja vu. This isn’t the first time the developers have tried to make a shooter happen in EVE Online: it’s the fourth. It’s just they've only gotten one out the door before. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When it comes to video game sales, there are very few titles that operate on the same stratosphere as Minecraft. The timeless sandbox game has shown its dominance yet again with an announcement from Mojang revealing that it has sold 300 million copies, helping it retain its position as one of the bestselling games of all time. \n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came during the Minecraft Live event held on October 15. Helen Chiang, who is the head of Mojang Studios, stated that the milestone was something \"no one could have dreamed of when we were all placing our first blocks.\" She also showed appreciation for the community, stating that it \"has built Minecraft into what it is today and what it will become in the future.\" \n\n\nMojang shared some interesting stats on Minecraft's official site. Between September 2023 and October 2023 alone, on average per day, there have been 15 million skeletons slayed, 8.8 million pickaxes crafted, and 6.7 million diamonds discovered. \n\n\nImage via Mojang.\n\n\nMinecraft's success story\n\n\nIt's been a long road for Minecraft to reach the heights it has. The game was birthed in 2009 by Notch and it gained a large following of avid fans that allowed the game to grow so popular that it was purchased, along with Mojang, by Microsoft for an amazing $2.5 billion in 2014. \n\n\nSince then, Minecraft has only grown thanks to a steady stream of new content, including the recent Trails and Tales update. There have also been numerous spin-offs released such as Minecraft Legends which launched in April this year. \n\n\nFans have plenty to look forward to. As the Minecraft Live event revealed, the armadillo is the winner of the 2023 Mob Vote. Minecraft is also turning 15 in 2024, and there is plenty in store to celebrate. \n\nThe post Minecraft has sold 300 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the imminent release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Sony has released the launch trailer, and it highlights the rise of a darker Peter. \n\n\nThe trailer showcases a number of huge sequences that are coming in the game, but be warned that it could also be considered pretty significant story spoilers for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. \n\n\n\n\nPeter & Miles team up against classic foes in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 launch trailer\n\n\nIn the trailer, Miles goes to Peter to ask for help. The trailer implies that Miles is in over his head fighting the Sandman. Fans of the original game may remember Sandman was teased via a backpack collectible that contained a vial of sand that Peter wasn’t sure if it actually contained Sandman or just some inert sand.\n\n\nBut the highlight of the trailer is the showcase of Venom and the symbiote-infected Peter, including a Peter in darker clothes and a rude demeanor towards MJ that hearkens back to Spider-Man 3. \n\n\nThe trailer also reveals Norman calling for Oscorp enforcers to “get the symbiote off of him!,” though the camera does not reveal who the him is. While it has been confirmed it won’t be Eddie Brock, and the first game teased it would be Harry Osborn, the actual identity of the game’s Venom has been kept a closely guarded secret. \n\n\nThe trailer does showcase more of the black suit, including a knock-down fight between Spider-Man and Lizard. There's also a tense battle between Miles and Mr. Negative, which would mark the first time Miles has been one-on-one with the man responsible for his father’s death. \n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2 releases October 20 for the PlayStation 5. You’ve still got plenty of time to pre-order that digital deluxe edition and get all those sweet costumes. \n\nThe post Peter Parker puts a little dirt in your eyes in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 launch trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

An immaculate and widely acclaimed aircraft simulator with the sort of pedigree that almost no other modern gaming franchise could compare with, and one that's due for a comprehensive 2024 update to make it even better. But that's not even close to the full story, as Parallel 42's wacky Juice Goose third-party DLC can attest to. Indeed, it would appear that some enterprising devs have been working in the background to redefine what Microsoft Flight Sim can and cannot do.\n\n\nSetting aside the wildly entertaining idea that Microsoft Flight Simulator might unofficially be turning into something along the lines of Forza Horizon, with the whole world being its playable area, the Juice Goose is supposedly a rather high-quality offering.

          "description": "Vincent is coming out of his coffin. Announced at the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth voice cast panel at New York Comic-Con, the voice actor for the gun-toting ex-Turk has been officially confirmed: Matt Mercer. This comes after fans claimed the prolific voice actor was the character when he appeared in the latest State of Play.\n\n\n\n\nDisturbing Vincent Valentine's slumber\n\n\nAs host, Matt Mercer brings up his background work in FFVII Remake after introducing the cast. He then puts the rumors to bed (or coffin, in this case) by saying that he will take on the role of Vincent Valentine in the sequel. Vincent, in Final Fantasy VII, is a former Turk who joins Cloud and his crew on their escapades as revenge on Hojo. He also was the protagonist in Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus, voiced by VA legend Steve Blum.\n\n\nBeing in the industry for many years, Matt Mercer is no stranger to big-ticket roles. His parts in Persona 5 (Yusuke), Fire Emblem (Chrom), and Overwatch (Cole Cassidy) were heavily praised. He also hosts the popular Dungeons & Dragons show, Critical Role. Most recently, he played the main villain Ganondorf in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Without a doubt, Matt is the perfect actor to take over Vincent Valentine. I, for one, can't wait to see him in all his glory.\n\n\nWhile fans are likely to be excited by the announcement of Vincent, a fan-favorite character, it is worth noting Square Enix already confirmed he will not be a playable party member during an exclusive interview with Game Informer. \n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth releases on February 29, 2024, for PlayStation 5. \n\nThe post Matt Mercer confirmed as Vincent Valentine in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The first Mortal Kombat 1 DLC characters have finally been showcased in a brand-new trailer. \n\n\nWhile series creator Ed Boon had coyly stated they wouldn't be showing an Omni-Man gameplay trailer at New York Comic-Con, that didn't stop them from dropping the trailer online. \n\n\n\n\nThe trailer reveals Omni-Man, voiced by J.K. Simmons, confronting Liu Kang. Liu threatens Omni-Man to kick things off, promising that while Omni-Man has destroyed worlds, he has erased whole timelines. \n\n\nThat doesn't seem to phase Omni-Man, though, who gladly spends the trailer beating the absolute snot out of Liu Kang and Scorpion. \n\n\nOmni-Man's release coincides with the return of Invincible to Amazon Prime Video, as well as the 20th anniversary of the Invincible comic. In the original story, Omni-Man is presented as a Superman pastiche whose son develops superpowers, taking the name Invincible. However, Omni-Man reveals he is actually on Earth to conquer it and hopes to do so with his son at his side. \n\n\nImage via NetherRealm Studios\n\n\nThere are, in fact, multiple nods to the comic included, especially his two fatalities, which reference him holding Invincible up to an oncoming train and Omni-Man's crushing of Red Rush's skull when he murdered Invincible's version of the Justice League. \n\n\nIn addition to Omni-Man, the trailer reveals the first DLC Kameo, Tremor. Originally debuting in the spin-off title Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, Tremor is now best known for his incredible redesign in Mortal Kombat X. \n\n\nOmni-Man is slated for a November 2023 release. Future Mortal Kombat 1 DLC for the game includes The Boys' Homelander, Peacemaker, Quan-Chi, Ermac, and Takeda. Mortal Kombat 1 is available right now. We gave it an 8/10, so it's pretty safe to say you should check it out. \n\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 reveals Omni-Man, Tremor in eye-popping new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Curiously, even though the game does have its fair share of gameplay-related problems, the problems that have been pushed into the spotlight are far more technical in nature. Namely, Lords of the Fallen runs exceedingly poorly. For some people, that is. Though some have managed to resolve the Unreal Engine 5 title's shoddy performance via driver updates, this is seemingly not a universal solution, meaning that the developer Hexworks has a long road ahead of it. The really curious bit, though, is that Lords of the Fallen seems to run just fine on the Steam Deck, of all things.\n\n\nIndeed, as the aptly named YouTuber Deck Wizard has shown, Valve's low-spec gaming PC seems to be more than capable of running Lord…",

The Van Gogh Museum, which recently held a Pokemon collab that got a bit hectic, announced it will no longer distribute its Pikachu promo card at the physical exhibit starting October 14. If you want the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat collaboration card, you'll have to shop online for a qualifying purchase. \n\n\nAs spotted by PokeJungle, the Van Gogh Museum explained it's no longer offering the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat promo card in person thanks to \"a small group of individuals\" it says \"created an undesirable situation.\" Without the chaos around the card giveaway, the museum believes fans can visit the Pokemon exhibit in a safe, enjoyable experience.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid via Pokemon Center Store\n\n\nHowever, the Pokemon Center will have the Pikachu card available later for online shoppers in the USA, Canada, and the UK, but no date was given. It will also go to various retailers in the Netherlands sometime next year. \n\n\nThe Museum also notes it's still selling merchandise at the exhibit; it's just the Van Gogh Pikachu dropping from its offerings. Those items are up in its online store, too. Restocks happen weekly, so don't panic if the Van Gogh Museum's online store hits you with an \"out of stock\" notice. \n\n\nCan't Catch a Break\n\n\nWhen the Pokemon exhibit was announced late September, many were in love with the concept. I mean, who doesn't want to see a Post-Impressionist painting of Snorlax? As always, there were people who saw it as a means to make a quick buck. So, when the event happened, droves of people flooded the Amsterdam museum to get their hands on merch, causing quite a stir. This led to the Van Gogh Museum pausing sales and an apology from the Pokemon Company.\n\n\nThe exhibit is still around, so if you do want to go as a real fan, tickets are still available.

Rumors swirled about who might take up the Italian plumber's big shoes after longtime voice Charles Martinet announced his departure from the role. Well, it's now confirmed that Mario, as well as Luigi, will be played by voice actor Kevin Afghani in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It's unknown if he will play the role in future titles.\n\n\n\n\nThis news comes a week before the highly-anticipated release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which will now mark Kevin's first appearance as the beloved icon. Nintendo themselves, as reported by The Verge, confirmed his role in an email sent out to them. The reveal of Mario and Luigi's new voice lines up with Doug Bowser (not that Bowser) saying the actor would be revealed towards release. It also comes a day after data-miners, according to Kotaku, managed to find the cast list through demos available at various Target locations.\n\n\nIn terms of Kevin Afghani's work, he hasn't done too much. His biggest role on IMDb lists Arnold in Genshin Impact. He's also done some YouTube skits for the video-game-based animation channel MASHED. It's a very impressive feat for someone to become the next face of Mario early in their career. I can speak for a lot of people when I say that we can't wait to see what Kevin can do and wish him the best. \n\n\nSuper Mario Bros.

Shortly thereafter, another user named Jay dueted Kaya with a melodica rendition of the theme’s recognizable melody line. From there, a particularly delectable brand of chaos began to take root as various users added their own videos to the chain, either providing sound effects or recreating the downright odd behavior of NPCs in the hit Nintendo 64 adventure.\n\n\nIt was one thing for user marce_chiriboga to provide the chickens and horse sound effects that sound as if they were ripped straight from the game, but it was another thing entirely when user Megs added their version of the infamous Master Craftsman and when user Tim Settineri contributed their take on the Beggar character — you know, the character who keeps patting their legs and raising their arms to the sky in an endless loop? There’s even a user who added a very, very slow-moving windmill.\n\n\nI often find that the internet has inspired the worst in humanity to bubble up to the surface. But, then I see the internet collaborating on this silly, but creative, duet chain and I am led to believe — as long as things like this continue to exist, maybe we’re gonna be alright.

During this time, he'll be reporting to Xbox CEO Phil Spencer to facilitate the company's integration into the Xbox family of first-party studios. \n\n\nImage via Activision Blizzard.\n\n\nNew days for Activision Blizzard\n\n\nIn Kotick's email, he expresses a positive attitude toward the acquisition, claiming it will allow Activision Blizzard to \"deliver more fun, more joy, and more connection to more players than ever before.\" He also mentions several of the industry-defining franchises that have come from the company, including Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.\n\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Activision Blizzard also released a public statement revealing how, as Xbox's team, it'll continue its mission to \"deliver the world’s most epic interactive entertainment experiences to more people, more platforms, and across more worlds than ever before.\" \n\n\nKotick's career as Activision Blizzard CEO has been an eventful one filled with plenty of successes, including the acquisition of Candy Crush developer King in 2015. However, he has also been the subject of controversy, and there have been reports that he was aware of instances of sexual assault in the workplace. \n\n\nWe already have an idea of what will come from the acquisition, as Activision Blizzard announced that we can expect more of its games to hit Game Pass next year. \n\nThe post Bobby Kotick stepping down as Activision Blizzard CEO following acquisition appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After being announced in July 2022 and delayed in August 2023, it looks like the planned remake of Lollipop Chainsaw is switching gears. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda announced as much on Twitter, saying they've \"changed the game design of RePOP from remake to remaster.\" Without sharing any details, Yasuda added that this decision was based on \"requests.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe recent delay of Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was put in place to provide \"the best possible quality experience.\" Originally planned as a remake and set for sometime in 2023, Dragami Games then changed that window to summer 2024. The original game by Grasshopper Manufacture served as a collaboration between Suda 51 and James Gunn. It launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 back in 2012.\n\n\nScreenshot via Dragami Games\n\n\nOh, Juliet\n\n\nSo, why exactly is this changing from a remake to a remaster? Dragami Games made a point of addressing concerns over changes in the past. Shortly after the announcement, Yasuda reassured fans, saying they don't plan on changing the story or aesthetics in the remake. That included pushing back against \"baseless assumptions\" that the team wanted to change protagonist Juliet's design. Then there was the whole question about censorship, which Yasuda said would be addressed in negotiations with platform holders.\n\n\nBasically, the more fans asked, the more Yasuda attempted to assuage their fears, noting that they plan to keep everything as close to the original as possible. Now they're taking things one step further with the move from remake to remaster. The only remaining sticking points are all those licensed songs. Yasuda previously said they were unable to include 16 of those songs. We'll have to see what else is planned for the remaster as further details are divulged. \n\nThe post Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP changes from remake to remaster due to ‘requests’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "To craft Cyberpunk 2077's immersive world, plenty of voice actors were necessary. CD Projekt Red ran into a problem when Miłogost Reczek, a Polish performer who did the Polish voice acting for Viktor Vektor, passed away in 2021. As revealed by Bloomberg, the studio overcame this setback with the help of artificial intelligence. \n\n\nIn a statement to Bloomberg, the studio explained that when developing the Polish language release of the Phantom Liberty DLC, it considered a few options regarding Vektor's voice. The studio mulled over replacing Reczek and re-recording his lines in the base game, but as CD Projekt Red localization director Mikołaj Szwed states, this idea was rejected in favor of AI which would keep Reczek's \"performance in the game and pay tribute to his wonderful performance as Viktor Vektor.\"\n\n\nImage via CD Projekt RED\n\n\nHow AI recreated Miłogost Reczek's voice in Cyberpunk 2077\n\n\nTo recreate Reczek's voice, CD Projekt Red first hired a new voice actor to record all the necessary lines for Phantom Liberty. Following this, a Ukraine-based voice-cloning software called Respeecher created an algorithm to alter the dialog to sound like Reczek. The use of AI in Phantom Liberty was done with permission from the Reczek family. According to Szwed, Reczek's sons were very supportive.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time Respeecher has been used in major AAA games. When developing God of War Ragnarok, Santa Monica had to use the software to keep Sunny Suljic's voice consistent throughout the development process. Suljic (born 2005) is the voice behind Atreus, and his changing voice was the consequence of a long development cycle extending across his growth spurt. \n\n\nThough AI can be exceptionally useful in game development, it does come with the possibility that it could permanently replace human voice actors. This has been a concern for SAG-AFTRA, which also represents performers in the gaming industry. \n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 used AI to replace deceased voice actor appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s mostly because the desert environment and assortment of vehicles remind me of my beloved Metal Max. The latest trailer shows off a bit more of the vehicles, with their combat being shown off in particular. I mean, we've seen this trailer before and even heard previews, but I just like tank combat.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the voices, they sure are speaking English. I kind of hate voiceovers in trailers because when they’re devoid of most of their context, it just feels off. Bandai Namco provided a list of who’s playing what role, and I had to look all of them up. Risa Mei is doing Beelzebub, John Lipow is on Rao (the ranger-looking guy), Owen Thomas is Thief, and Keith Silverstein is Lucifer. It’s an experienced cast, but no massive celebrities from other media, which is honestly preferable.\n\n\nSand Land is set in an expansive wasteland that has overtaken the planet in the wake of war and environmental disasters. Beelzebub joins a crew that seeks to find a source of water in the sun-blasted environment. It’s based on a 2000 serial comic from Weekly Shōnen Jump by Akira Toriyama. I’m just here for the tanks and vehicular exploration.\n\n\nThe release date for Sand Land release date is still to be announced, but it’s set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5.\n\nThe post Updated Sand Land story trailer shows off the English dub and vehicular combat appeared first on Destructoid.",

Diablo 4 will be heading to Steam with the upcoming Season 2, Season of Blood. The second season releases on October 17 on all platforms, and will be the first time D4 is playable on Steam. The Store Page for the game on Steam has already been updated to indicate its verification.\n\n\n\n\nThis is honestly a pretty big move. The other Blizzard game that recently came to Steam, Overwatch 2, is Playable on Steam Deck but not Verified. One of the many issues players have with OW2 on Steam is its poor performance on Steam Deck.\n\n\nThe decision to make Diablo 4 Steam Deck Verified is a good one because the gameplay fits pretty naturally on a handheld device like the Steam Deck. The verification indicates that Valve has tested D4 on the device and can verify that it is fully functional and works great with the built-in controls and display.\n\n\nA note on the verification page points out that the singleplayer gameplay will still require an active internet connection.\n\n\nDiablo 4 comes to Steam and Steam Deck on October 17 with the launch of Season 2.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Steam launch will be Steam Deck Verified appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, we now know it has initially sold better in its first week than the likes of Watch Dogs: Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Immortals: Fenyx Rising.\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nSome of the stats celebrated the occasion are kind of fun, too. So far, players have spent 479 collective years parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad. Assassins also took 60 million Leaps of Faith. Then there's the most important, we've pet 1.2 million street cats.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is a stroll away from the massive open-world formula of recent titles like Valhalla and Odyssey. It's in a smaller space in Baghdad with a focus on the core stealth gameplay. Perhaps this approach appeals to lapsed fans of the series. It is also at a cheaper price point of $49.99.\n\n\n\"For the most part, Mirage achieves its goal of returning to its assassin ways,\" says our review. \"But in some ways, it also shows me why Ubisoft made the decision to take the franchise in a new direction in the first place.\"\n\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Mirage is the “biggest new gen launch” for Ubisoft yet appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it appears as though redundancies may be felt in the IT, HR, marketing, customer service, and usability departments.\n\n\nImage via Team17.\n\n\nDevelopers are said to have contacted Eurogamer with concerns that upcoming games published by Team17 may be in jeopardy. At the time of writing, the studio has not issued an official statement, nor publically given a reason behind the restructure.\n\n\nA bad time to be part of a development team\n\n\nThis seems to be just one more example of a wider issue in the current gaming industry. Publishers and studios have been restructuring departments and teams, which has unfortunately led to staff members being let go.\n\n\nRecently, it was reported that Naughty Dog had also been hit with layoffs, as had The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us studio Telltale Games. Epic Games has also cut 16% of its workforce recently, impacting around 830 employees in total.\n\n\nIt's not just game developers, either. Streaming service Twitch has also been experiencing layoffs, making it feel like anyone who works in gaming in any capacity isn't safe.\n\n\nHopefully, Team17 will issue a statement about the reported layoffs, but right now feels like a shaky time to be involved in the video game industry.\n\nThe post Worms developer Team17 set to lay off a third of its staff appeared first on Destructoid.",

These days, it's mainly through games that I get my scares, which is why I was quite excited when Steam Next Fest rolled around again.\n\n\nScouring the horror section has been a delight, and while there have been some that haven't stood out, I want to give a shoutout to Nayuta Studio's Hollow Cocoon. This tasty jam of an indie horror title has a lot of potential, appealing to those who like a bit of Japanese folklore to spread on their gaming toast like some sort of macabre marmalade (that is definitely not a thing).\n\n\n\n\nHollow Cocoon has all the hallmarks of an immersive horror experience.

Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. \n\"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani,\" Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.\nAfghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. \nIncredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!\nOctober 13, 2023\nAfghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.\nSuper Mario Bros.

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nFinale - Waking the Dragons\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday.

Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. \nThank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/KnL2YxGION\nOctober 11, 2023\nAlongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: \n479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad\n60 million Leaps of Faith\n1.2 million street cats pet\n\"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception,\" Ubisoft's statement reads. \"We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment.\" \n\n\nWe had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review.

It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. \nIn 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim.

Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.\n\"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,\" the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. \"There are four separate cover panels,\" it says, \"with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.\" This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.\nThe slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. \nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY.

The headsets have not been without their growing pains, but the path from Rift to Quest has been generally smooth, and the iterations have always added worthy improvements. Meta Quest 3 continues along that path to deliver what is, by a large margin, my favorite VR headset, but it doesn’t fix all the problems the medium continues to face.\nComfortability And Visuals\nWearing Meta Quest 3 is reasonably comfortable.

          "description": "Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started.

All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. \nCheck out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below: \nWelcome to…LEGO Animal Crossing!#AnimalCrossing #LEGO #Nintendo pic.twitter.com/un3R7QwlRC\nOctober 5, 2023\nThis Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now. \nAre you going to be picking up any of these Animal Crossing Legos when they release? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. \nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game. \nDo you like Red Dead Redemption or Red Dead Redemption II more? Let us know in the comments below!",

After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. \nIf you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more. \nYou can read Game Informer's Mirag…",

It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. \nToday, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is \"driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take\" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters',\" a press release reads. \"Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
