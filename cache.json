We’ve seen plenty of sliding-tile puzzlers over the years, but Furniture & Mattress’ adventure is defined by its framing. It’s not an RPG, but it absolutely feels like one in many different ways. You have to use weapons to defeat certain monsters blocking your path. There’s a whole coming-of-age story about leaving home and growing up. There are even boss battles.\nIt’s as if puzzle designer Nico Recabarren (developer on Ethereal) built a completely new Rubix Cube, artist David Hellman (Braid) painted that Rubix Cube, and writer Nick Suttner (Carto) sketched out a world of fun and adventure around it, with everything taking place on a bunch of interconnected square grids. We’ve been enamoured since its reveal during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and going hands-on with the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we can’t wait to cause chaos by moving tiles around.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Just waiting on that call from Nintendo.\nIn a move that very few of us saw coming, PlayStation's Horizon series is heading to Nintendo Switch (albeit in the slightly more family-friendly, LEGO Horizon Adventures form). Is this a crossover episode? Are we witnessing the start of a bold new partnership between Sony and the Big N? Does this mean PlayStation IP will start leaking into the likes of Super Smash Bros.? We'd have to assume 'no' for that last one, but that's not to say that the devs of this latest LEGO adventure wouldn't be up for it.\nIn a new feature from Kotaku, Guerrilla Games' franchise development lead producer Tim Symons (who previously spent a decade at Nintendo of Europe as a Product Development Manager amongst other roles) was asked whether Horizon on Switch might lead to a Smash collaboration at some point down the line.

          "description": "Portable monsters for the kids (and kids at heart).\nWhen Capcom released Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin on Nintendo Switch back in 2021, there may have been some that said, \"Wait, there was a first game?\" It's worth remembering that the original outing of Monster Hunter Stories came towards the end of the 3DS era; in fact, it was released after the Switch had launched in 2017. It'd be understandable, then, if it was missed by plenty of gamers in a way that its sequel — on the current and dominant Nintendo system — was not.\nNow we have Monster Hunter Stories on Switch to right that wrong, and to ensure that Nintendo fans have both tales readily available. It's welcome, too; though these kid-friendly RPG outings for the series don't push the boundaries of the genre or even add much to the IP's impressive global reach, they are a pleasant introduction to a franchise that is traditionally rather challenging. This first entry comes with some enhancements, too, but it also feels unabashedly like the 3DS original, which isn't always a good thing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I must now hang my head and await the executioner's ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero's ambience and layouts owe something to From's work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.\nRead more",

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.\nRead more",

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

The first of these will confront you right at the beginning, offering two paths: 'Take her hand' or 'Don't take her hand.' This choice is not to be taken lightly, as it will shape your entire experience in SMT V: Vengeance. We're here to guide you toward the most beneficial outcome.\n\n\nSMT V: Vengeance take the hand decision guide\n\n\nWhen you reach out to the body in the early cutscenes of SMT V: Vengeance, a voice will tell you that this girl is not ready to exist quite yet. You'll choose to either reach out to her or ignore it. Grab the girl's hand to experience the new storyline, Canon of Vengeance. On the other hand, don't grab the girl's hand if you wish to check out SMT V's original narrative, Canon of Creation. Newcomers may be inclined to take this route to see what events transpired in the original version. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlthough Canon of Vengeance could be seen as the 'evil route,' it's the only way to access the brand-new story. This pathway may involve more morally ambiguous choices and darker themes. It'll still follow a similar route to the original but with a few twists and turns. Vengeance's new character will also join your party frequently, resulting in exclusive dialogue and cutscenes. She's honestly a pretty good ally to have and can make battles much more accessible.\n\n\nEven if you're a beginner, you can still take the hand if you so desire. Like most SMT entries, Vengeance is a standalone experience, meaning you can enjoy the new content without feeling lost or overwhelmed by the game's lore or previous entries. Of course, it's entirely up to you to make the final decision. Plus, the game allows you to revert your choice at this point if you happen to change your mind. \n\nThe post Should you take the hand or not in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance? appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll encounter these tests a few times, primarily when asking a Demon to join your crew. However, the side quest, In Pursuit of Knowledge, takes this a step further by asking a series of difficult questions. Here's how to complete In Pursuit of Knowledge in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.\n\n\nAll answers to In Pursuit of Knowledge quest in SMT V: Vengeance\n\n\nIn Pursuit of Knowledge's quest start can be found above the Jouin U. Medical Research Lab in Azabu. Speak to the Jouin Student to begin the test. Then, select the following prompts to get the correct answers in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's In Pursuit of Knowledge mission:\n\n\n\nThe demon Onmoraki is a monstrous bird with a human face. What is its original form?\n\nHuman corpse\n\n\n\n\nAmongst the hierarchy of demons, what is the name of the evil spirit from which the word \"demon\" originates?\n\nCacodaemon\n\n\n\n\nWhat should you do to remove the omelet-loving spirit Aitvaras from your home?\n\nLight a candle\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you pick the wrong answers in the In Pursuit of Knowledge quest, the Jouin Student will send you away until you've chosen the correct one. No matter what, players will earn the same rewards, regardless if they've picked the wrong selections.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCompleting the In Pursuit of Knowledge in SMT V: Vengeance earns you the Treacherous Order Periapt. This allows two demons of the Dark to utilize a Law alignment, offering the Magatsuhi Skill. The Treacherous Order Periapt provides a large amount of MP to all allies and a '1 Press Turn' icon to your next turn.

This item is used to attract insects to your location for three minutes. To unlock the Honey Lure recipe, you’ll need to reach at least level 7 in Bug Catching and the recipe costs 2,000 Gold.

And thanks to one modder, Larxian, Final Fantasy may have a little more to explore in Kingdom Hearts as they've dropped Sora right into the Final Fantasy 15 city, Insomnia, with their in-development mod. \n\n\nSora uses his flowmotion abilities all over Insomnia\n\n\nInsomnia is the crown city of Final Fantasy 15, in which Noctis lived throughout his childhood and he returns to later in life. In this mod, we can play as Sora swinging on the architecture of the city and zooming from place to place in an instant. It's reminiscent of Noctis maneuvering his way around the skyscraper in the initial Final Fantasy Versus XIII reveal trailer...just less gory, a little more Disney. \n\n\n\n\nLarxian began to share details on social media about the mod project in March 2023. They have since added NPCs to the city and even included a Moogle Shop. The modder tracks their progress on X, and you can follow along by searching for #InsomniaMod. While there's no ETA just yet, it looks like they've made plenty of headway in bringing Insomnia to life. \n\n\nThis Kingdom Hearts 3 mod might be the beginning of what's to come\n\n\nEver since the Kingdom Hearts 3 secret movie, many fans have speculated on the parallels between the Versus XIII marketing and the secret movie. It's all thanks to Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura's history as the director of the Versus XIII project before it transitioned to Final Fantasy 15. One of the last shots of the Kingdom Hearts 3 Re: Mind secret movie is influenced by the scene in which Noctis is sitting at the back of a limousine car, looking out towards the window. Yozora is doing the exact same motion. \n\n\n\n\nPerhaps in Kingdom Hearts 4, we'll see Quadratum's version of Insomnia and the skyscraper, like those we see in this mod. \n\nThe post Sora explores Final Fantasy 15 city in Kingdom Hearts 3 mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since then, other games named on that list have been released or announced, suggesting the accuracy of it.\n\n\nThe Reddit thread is part of revelations around the prolific leaker of information about Sega and Atlus, Midori. News about their identity raised discussion over the accuracy of their previous leaks, with the thread singling out reports that Visions of Mana is being delayed on PS4. A comment questioning the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster was brought up by another user, and noted newshound Jason Schreier stepped in to say, “Hi. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is real and happening.”\n\n\nThis news is not arriving from Square Enix, so it shouldn’t be taken as official confirmation. However, the Reddit account is verified as belonging to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, and he is a generally reliable source.\n\n\nA remaster of 1997’s Final Fantasy Tactics wouldn’t be all that surprising, as Tactics Ogre just received a similar treatment in 2022, and the two games are cut from the same cloth. A suggested remake of Final Fantasy IX was also part of the Geforce Now leak, which is a much more difficult-to-believe possibility, but given the accuracy of the list so far, anything could happen.\n\nThe post Rumored Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is reportedly ‘real and happening’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now ININ has come through with a date, opening the umbrella for a smooth glide to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox consoles on July 11, 2024.\n\n\nWith that lovely news comes an appropriately bubbly release date trailer, showing some footage of the port and promising \"many quality-of-life enhancements.\" Please, enjoy another pre-release peek at Bub and Bob in their stout little human forms and prep for the arrival of the Rainbow Islands sequel below.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what those enhancements are, the updated port has added in the usual retro bells and whistles, namely the inclusion of save states and the ability to rewind gameplay. There are also shaders and filters that aim to recreate the experience of playing on a CRT screen. Beyond that, the hook here is very much the ability to play and own a relatively obscure entry in Taito's storied series.\n\n\nThere's no mention of including the other versions — which spanned Atari ST, Amiga, Game Boy, and NES — so it looks like we're just getting the PC Engine/Turbografx-16 version of Parasol Stars. That's fine and dandy, especially considering the fact that it's priced at a cool $9.99.

Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before.

The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. \nA PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). \nHere’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:\nSea of Thieves\nMadden NFL 24\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III\nHelldivers 2\nNBA 2K24\nMLB The Show 24\nStellar Blade\nFallout 4\nWho’s Your Daddy?!\nTom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege\nGrounded\nAnother Crab’s Treasure\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2\nNHL 24\nKiller Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game\nRise of the Ronin\nAssassin’s Creed Mirage\nWWE 2K24\nElden Ring\nFor more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch.

The 48-minute presentation sits down with the game’s developers and performers to shed new light on Max Caulfield’s return to the franchise and her new powers while showing off extended gameplay. \nThe story seemingly unfolds a few years after the events of Life is Strange.

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. \nThe update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. \n\n\nTo start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. \nThis upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. \nAre you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!",

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. \nFor the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. \n“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,\" said Linke. \"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.

Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation's blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.\n\n\nIt opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention.

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. \nThe 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. \n\n\nIf you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. \n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number. \nClair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is \"33\" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these \"Expeditioners\" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.\n\n\nThe game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and sports slick-looking turn-based action.

          "description": "The long-lost reboot of Perfect Dark made its grand return during today's Xbox Games Showcase. First announced in 2020 at The Game Awards, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic. \nThe over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.\n\n\nPerfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. It is coming to Xbox Series X/S, but it still has no release window.",

          "description": "Fable will launch sometime next year, developer Playground Games has revealed. It did so during today's Xbox Games Showcase with a new trailer that features quick snippets of gameplay starring our heroine. \nIn the trailer, we see our hero waltzing through a large medieval town while a narrator discusses an old threat returning to the world. Our hero wants to save Albion, and to do so, she needs to enlist the help of Humphry, who is the one narrarating the trailer. \nWhile there appears to be gameplay in the trailer, there's no U.I. and no combat – it's mostly just our hero protagonist walking and running through various fantastical locations. We do see some glimpses of combat, but it looks cinematic so it's hard to tell if it's actual combat gameplay. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Fable gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"What does it mean to be a hero,\" the trailer's description reads. \"Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion's very existence.\" \nMicrosoft revealed Fable was coming back in 2020, with a reveal trailer from Forza Horizon developer Playground Games. We then got our next look at the game with a more narrative-focused trailer starring Richard Ayoade last year, and today's new trailer is our first look at the game since then. \nFable launches on Xbox Series X/S (and presumably PC) in 2025. \nWhat do think of this new trailer? Let us know in the comments below!",

What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint's introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could've been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie's relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
