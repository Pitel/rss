Released back in 2000 for the N64, Rare's first-person shooter depicted a world set in the year 2023 during which two alien races - the Maians and the Skedar - are locked in an interstellar war. On Earth, two rival corporations known as The Carrington Institute and dataDyne are both in league with the Maians and the Skedar respectively. Joanna Dark, the game's protagonist, carries out multiple missions including the elimination of a clone of the President, and the destruction of the Skedar leader on the alien homeworld.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's only the start of January, but we already know that we're going to be playing the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fire Emblem Engage, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Pikmin 4 within the next 12 months, and that's all while being fully aware that Nintendo likely has a boatload of other surprises up its sleeve. Phew!\nWe are, however, a sentimental bunch here at Nintendo Life, and we love our 3DS consoles. The problem, though, is that most people have understandably moved on and are now taking their Switches out and about on their travels. What the Switch lacks, however, is the excellent StreetPass feature from the 3DS, and we reckon its about time we start getting those sweet dopamine hits from the green StreetPass notification light once again.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.\r\n\n\r\nPossibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.\r\n\n\r\nYou guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those. \r\n \nRead more",

This brought a broad mandate to cover indie games and PC Game Pass and to do, like, whatever else I think might be fun or good. It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not. I'm still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I'm quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too.

This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time. \nRead more",

There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.\nOut of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!\nRead more",

I feel so honored - and I’m pretty happy with how the GOTY 2022 Calendar turned out, as most of my top choices made it into the roster. However, great games are sure to fall by the wayside in any year - which is why we have our Selection Boxes of honorable mentions this year, right? For my picks I've swept up three quite different games, but I think they come together to give a very Rachel vibe.\nRead more",

In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites!

No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, \"Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!\". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like \"Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?\" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).\nBecause we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!\n Read more",

Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, \"I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!\" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point.

          "description": "December always feels like a good month for VR gaming. Perhaps it's because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I'm likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you're giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I'll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.\r\n\n\r\nFirst though, it's time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol' shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I'd probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.\nRead more",

          "description": "I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that's a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it's oh so satisfying.\nWe've written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven't played enough to give you a big wot I think. It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.\nYaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.\nRead more",

Some of the affected characters will include Widowmaker, who will turn enemies to stone, Junker Queen, who will call lightning down during her ultimate to do devastating damage, and Roadhog, who will turn into a giant cyclops.\nBlizzard released a trailer as part of the event's announcement, which revealed a good number of details about what we can expect from Battle for Olympus. Players will be able to earn \"divine rewards,\" and while they don't specify what that entails, it's likely to be the usual roundup of voice lines, sprays, victory poses, and hopefully the skins that we can see in the trailer, because they look sick as hell.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbI57nJsAkU\nThe epic free-for-all battles will take place on what I consider the best arcade map: Château Guillard. But the fun doesn't stop there, because after the event is over, whichever hero has secured the most eliminations throughout the event will get a marble statue of their likeness added to the control map Ilios. Looks like our favorite heroes have a chance at immortality.\nWhile Overwatch 2 hasn't exactly been my favorite game as of late, I am a sucker for Greek mythology. I'm not alone here, and Blizzard knows exactly what they're doing in getting some more players back into the game. It looks like the game's second Season is gonna be chock full of events, because even before Battle for Olympus concludes, we'll be into the Lunar New Year event that runs from January 17-February 6 this year.\n[Featured Image via Blizzard Entertainment]\nThe post Become a god in the Overwatch 2 Battle for Olympus limited time event appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get a closer look at the Lands Between\nFor super fans, buying an art book can be one of the most gratifying pieces of merch you can collect, whether it's for their favorite show, film, or of course, game. I'm someone who really loves to see how the sausage gets made, and having a book I can flip through from time to time and get a peek at the artistic process behind one of my favorite things is weirdly important to me. If you're a fan of Elden Ring and feel the same way, you're in for a treat, because FromSoftware has opened the pre-orders for the game's two-volume art book.\nAs the best books usually are, these volumes are both oversized hardbacks at 8.25\" x 11.75\". There's plenty of content for FromSoft to show off, because the first volume is 432 pages, and the second is 384 pages long. The former will feature art of the game's opening cinematic, as well as key art, concept art, and development design documents focused on the Lands Between, its dungeons, characters, and armor designs. The latter volume will highlight the game's enemies, items, and weapons.\n[caption id=\"attachment_356578\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via FromSoftware[/caption]\nIt's looking like Amazon is the only place to pre-order the books in the western regions as of now, but there's a chance that they'll be available from other retailers once we're closer to the July 25, 2023 release date. As of now the books are also both listed for $59.99 a pop, so they'll be an investment for sure.\nFor a game as big and beautiful as Elden Ring, it would be a real shame for any of the development work to go unnoticed, because the team clearly worked hard to bring its world to life. Like I said, I love art books on principle, but I truly can't think of a property that's more deserving of one.\n[Featured Image via FromSoftware]\nThe post Official Elden Ring art books are now listed for pre-order appeared first on Destructoid.",

I used to play with a team every night in college, and I got so close with those guys, I even went to one of their weddings. It was a huge part of my life for a long time, and then it just... wasn't. The game started to change, my life got busier, and I simply moved on to other things. Every few months I would log back in for a match or two to reminisce, but I had to admit to myself that the best of my Overwatch career was behind me.\nThen, of course, there was the announcement of Overwatch 2.

Skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve will be available for purchase in the Fall Guys store in collaboration with Skybound Games, so don't be surprised if you see some new super-friends soaring through your matches soon. Of course, Fall Guys is a family friendly game, so we won't be seeing quite as much blood and gore as we're used to from these characters.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1610290021478580227\nAmazon Prime's acclaimed animated series Invincible is based on a comic series of the same name, written by Walking Dead comic author Robert Kirkman. Season one was a massive success when it dropped in 2021, even spawning a series of popular memes, and while we know another season is supposed to drop sometime this year, it's anyone's guess as to when we can expect it. Some fans are hoping that this Fall Guys collab means we'll be getting an update soon, and I'm certainly in that boat myself.\nFall Guys has also seen a resurgence since it went free-to-play last year, and rightfully so. I returned to the game recently after not having touched it since 2020, and it's probably even more fun than I remember due to all the new stages and content that they've added. My backlog has been keeping me plenty busy as of late, but Fall Guys is one of those games I know I'll be coming back to when my schedule clears up a bit. Certainly as a fan of the Invincible series, it'll be worth logging on to see if I can't secure some of these new skins.\n[Featured Image via Amazon]\nThe post Invincible crashes its way into Fall Guys with some new skins appeared first on Destructoid.",

This latest retread will launch on unannounced platforms later in 2023.\nFirst released on PC and PS3 way back in 2010, The Devil's Playhouse was the third of Telltale Games' Sam & Max adventures, and sees the Freelance Police investigate a series of strange phenomena linked to the powerful psychic machinations of the mysterious \"Toys of Power\". The original release of The Devil's Playhouse sported a fresh new game engine, and allowed the player to take direct control of both Sam and Max independently — allowing for a shakeup of the title's puzzle elements and adding an extra emphasis on synergy and teamwork between the two characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYPuWAQvRyw&ab_channel=Skunkape\nWhile Skunkape Games has not offered any official information on the new title, we can likely expect The Devil's Playhouse Remastered to feature updated character models and environmental textures, tauter controls, and slicker U.I. integration. If we're lucky, we might also see the new release include additional artwork, voicework, and music, as was the case for both Save the World Remastered and Beyond Time and Space Remastered. We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information — including platforms and a release date — is forthcoming.\nSam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered is currently in development at Skunkape Games.\nThe post Sam & Max: The Devil’s Playhouse Remastered hits the road in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whoa\nPocket Card Jockey remains one of my all-time favorite games for the Nintendo 3DS. I absolutely adore that little mash-up of solitaire and horse racing. In fact, it's one of just two games that I still play with some regularity on my New Nintendo 2DS XL (the other being Fantasy Life). That'll change later this month when Pocket Card Jockey comes to Apple Arcade. Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! revives the Game Freak classic for iOS devices as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game will feature races rendered in 3D along with the classic gameplay that made it so addictive.\nYou might remember Game Freak had ported the original Pocket Card Jockey to Android not long after the game launched for 3DS, but that version was never localized outside of Japan. While this version of the game is different than the Android port, it is yet another long-lost mobile title that has been rescued for the Apple Arcade service. You might remember PlatinumGames' World of Demons disappeared from app stores after its original soft release only to pop up as an Apple Arcade exclusive many months later. The same thing happened with Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls.\nWhile the Apple Arcade release calendar isn't as exciting as it once was, it is comforting to know that Apple is sticking with the service and bringing fun new titles like Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! to subscribers. Ride On! is one of a few games announced for a January release, with the others being Episode XOXO from Pocket Gems, the jigsaw puzzler Illustrated, and physics puzzler Squiggle Drop.\nThe post Pocket Card Jockey rides onto Apple Arcade later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Let us make a journey to the cave of monsters...\nAs the year closes out, the retro enthusiasts over at Hamster Corp have one more offering for 2022, bolstering the Arcade Archives range with nothing less than one of the most iconic video games of all time: Taito's Bubble Bobble.\nReleased to the freshly rejuvenated arcade scene in 1986, Bubble Bobble practically needs no introduction. This single-screen platformer sees one or two players step into the scaly suits of bubble-blowing dinosaurs Bub and Bob, as they descend through 100 levels of monsters and mayhem on a quest to rescue their abducted sweethearts. Facing off against a plethora of strange and instantly recognizable villains — including the notorious Baron Von Blubba — Bubble Bobble provided aracde goers one helluva challenge, and remains a fun and compelling experience decades down the line.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber AL82 Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTR0xqRCfUk&ab_channel=AL82RetrogamingLongplays\nThanks to its super-cute characters, colorful world, and instantly recognizable theme tune, Bubble Bobble would become one of the most financially successful arcade games of its day, leading to a series of home ports, various sequels and spin-offs, and a place in the annals of game history. Bub and Bob would go on to continue their adventures in 1987's Rainbow Islands, and would make a notable comeback with the block-busting smash hit series Puzzle Bobble. This is not to speak of a multitude of remakes, remasters, and rereleases, or Bub and Bob's frequent cameo appearances in many of Taito's other hits.\nBubble Bobble is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Arcade Archives closes out 2022 with the iconic Bubble Bobble appeared first on Destructoid.",

These include Paramount Pictures' hugely successful sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sega's major PC and console release Sonic Frontiers, retro compilation Sonic Origins, and the recent Netflix animated series Sonic Prime. And that's not to mention the launch of the new Sonic LEGO line, which debuted almost one year ago to the day.\nRiding high off of new interest in the iconic Sega mascot, Iizuka notes that Sonic Team is far from done with the series, and hopes to continue this wave of new multimedia endeavors well into 2023 and beyond. As good as 2022 has been for Sonic and pals, it looks like the coming year intend to build upon the series new and veteran fanbase.\n\"We are preparing a second wave to keep the fans happy and maintain that momentum going into 2023,\" notes Iizuka. \"We already announced additional content for Sonic Frontiers, but there is a lot more outside of that, so please look forward to it.\"\nSonic Frontiers and Sonic Origins are available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

          "description": "'We need 1 more week to ensure quality'\nAlthough folks on the majority of Stardew Valley platforms have been enjoying update 1.5 for quite a while now, the mobile edition still needs one final push. That was supposed to come by the end of the year, but a new tweet from developer Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has some insight into the final, final deadline for the patch.\nHere's the full context from the tweet:\n\"MOBILE: The porting team and I have been working extremely hard this past week on the 1.5 update. We're so close. We could probably release right now. But we need 1 more week to ensure quality. I accept full responsibility for not hitting the end of year target.\"\n\nAs far as I'm concerned: no worries! Stardew Valley has earned so much good will at this point, that folks can wait a bit more for an update. It helps that the game is also on basically every platform under the sun, so there are options available.\nThat said, it's admirable to see Barone taking responsibility, even if it's not needed. This whole saga has been a masterclass on transparency and communication; and how developers can opt to treat their fans in an era of nonsense, especially given how Stardew basically gives everything out for free.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1608709035318206465\nThe post Long-waited Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile update is ‘close,’ but needs one more week appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. \nThe first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …",

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nHow do you want to see the Metal Gear Solid series return?

The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. \n\n\nFormally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023.

But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.\nWith the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6.

          "description": "It’s the end of May, and I’m watching the credits roll in Elden Ring. After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.\nElden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind. I stopped eating Red Lobster because it caused me to suffer terrible flashbacks of getting relentless…",

PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be \"announced soon.\" You can read the full blog post here.\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.\nThis is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...",

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon.

As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. \nThe full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen. \nWhile the basis of the FTC’s lawsuit is …",

Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.\nWith Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing. Read more...",

They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.\nBut even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right.

Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. \nThe series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.\nNieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023.

The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.\nGolf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. \nYou can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.\n\n\nGolf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it \"a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,\" awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.\nSports Story is available now for Switch.",

Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.\nThe blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.\n\"I was fascinated by real time 3D graphics that many had been waiting for, and created and presented plans for all kinds of video games, not ju…",

As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll \"share more details once we get closer to the release.\" \n\n\nWhile many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game's director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era. \nAre you going to replay God of War Ragnarök using this New Game Plus mode next year?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nEpisode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle\nEpisode 2- When Doves Cry\nEpisode 3 - Bible.\nEpisode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair\n\n\nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
