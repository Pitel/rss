          "description": "A magnificent seven?\nUnless you’re a Neo Geo diehard, Visco isn't as recognisable as Namco, Konami, Capcom, or the other big hitters they used to roll with in the early '90s arcade scene. And, although the company made strong impressions with the likes of Vasara, the majority of its work was for SNK’s Neo Geo hardware, as represented by the seven games in this collection.\nPublisher PixelHeart, who acquired a license to at least part of Visco’s library, has been mining the company’s back catalogue with real vigour recently. It has published Ganryu 2 and Andro Dunos 2, both from independent developers, as well as releasing various ports, reproductions, and even a branded bartop arcade machine. This VISCO Collection, jointly published with QUByte Interactive, is either a culmination of sorts, or another brick in the wall; but, while there are a few unfortunate omissions in the library, it remains a solid and well-represented lineup.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Reset Switch.\nSwitch, eh? You think it's had its final bookend game and then another all-timer comes along to extend the library. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looked like the perfect finale for an extraordinary console that kicked off with Breath of the Wild, but then Nintendo goes and puts out the best 2D Mario in 30 years with Super Mario Wonder. And between those and continuing on into 2024 you've got fantastic games like Pikmin 4, and (hopefully) the upcoming WarioWare: Move It! and Super Mario RPG extending the bookshelf even further. It's a heck of a console with an extraordinary library that Just. Keeps. Going.\nWe love it, but we're also well aware that it's not perfect, and as we begin sliding into the closing months of 2023, we at Team Nintendo Life have been pondering what lessons the fabled 'Switch 2' really needs to learn from its long-lived predecessor. The six-and-a-half years we've spent with our Switches has given us ample time to discover all the wrinkles that we hope to see ironed out in future hardware, and below we look at things we believe are essential fixes, as well as a wishlist of non-essentials we'd sure like to see.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, after years of full-price legacy editions, the Switch finally has a good version of the yearly football (or soccer, if you want) game under its belt — albeit with a new name slapped on the cover. Now, the latest edition of the beautiful game has been given a beautiful update, so let's take a look at what's involved, shall we?\nTitle update 4 looks to tackle a number of issues that arose shortly after the game launched including the one bug that saw the ball uncannily sticking to the dribbler's calf allowing it to be literally run into the goal — freaky.

This one follows Detective Pikachu and Tim as they attempt to track down the latter's missing flan — a crime that we can all agree, is completely unacceptable.

Hang on, that doesn't sound right...\nIn a move that surely has the Ninjaphone ringing off the hook in Nintendo Lawyer HQ, the latest release from American rapper Asianae, 'Motion', samples Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. theme.

          "description": "Knot the best port.\nGordian Quest, like many games of its ilk, is bogged down by dense, cumbersome menus and volumes of small text. But unlike a lot of other games in the strategy and deckbuilding genre, it's much easier to wrap your mind around and isn't mired in frustratingly long tutorials and steep learning curves. Weaving tabletop inspirations into deckbuilding gameplay creates a fun, replayable game that lacks teeth, but provided enough satisfaction to keep us engaged, even if its myriad of meddlesome menus made it a struggle.\nThe game is presumably named after the Gordian Knot, a mythical knot so difficult to untie it became a proto-Arthurian, sword-in-the-stone-type legend used to anoint Alexander the Great as the Chosen One / God-King / Emperor over the Macedonian Empire after he, as the legend has it, sliced it atwain. If that's the case, it's ironic that this game's menus are so difficult to navigate that they too require some divine sense of inspiration to be able to cut through. This may sound like hyperbole, but doing something as simple as equipping a weapon felt like a Sisyphean task, even when its menus were clearly legible.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After decades of neglect, however, Switch owners can now rejoice, as we’re not only getting one, but five games from Hideo Kojima’s Magnum Opus (plus a couple of fun non-canon extras thrown in for good measure). The question, however, is whether this compilation - dubbed Master Collection Vol. 1 - is actually worth owning.\nThe good news is that, yes, this is more or less a strong representation of Metal Gear’s history from 1987 to 2004, encompassing everything from the original MSX2 release of Metal Gear to the critically acclaimed prologue, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. For newcomers especially, the collection is a convenient way to experience a significant chunk of the Metal Gear saga, but there are admittedly several drawbacks that dull the shine on what could (and should) have been an easy slam dunk for Konami.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. \r\n\n\r\nSo why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. \nAlan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet. \nRead more",

          "description": "At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map \"powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline\".\nI've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.\nRead more",

Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm.

Following last year's excellent Brutalist Jam map pack, Quake mappers have reunited to release another free load of levels inspired by Brutalism and concrete. The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I'd recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.\nRead more",

By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” \r\n\n\r\n\r\nPétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.\nThe game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.\nRead more",

It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. \nThe goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little.

This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami's stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It's this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it's a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they're fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?\r\n\n \nRead more",

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will \"absolutely\" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will \"probably\" retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?\nI couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself.

This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.\r\n\n\r\nI'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.\r\n \nRead more",

But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.\nThat's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error.

          "description": "It's been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game's mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that \"it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn't great.\" Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... \"feature-complete\" and \"into the polishing phase\", meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.\r\n\n\r\nCloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through \"OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson\" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.\nI didn't love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it's sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.\nEven though it's a bloody roguelike. Godddd.\nRead more",

I've read a few sci-fi novels in my time, and have come to the conclusion that tunnelling into other dimensions is seldom a wise move, but there's no turning back at the threshold when you're nurturing a mighty galactic empire, I guess. Find a trailer below in which some poor science ship pilot gets his brain fried by a crackling window of purple impossibility.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  \nIt's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as \"initial piano concepts\" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It's so, so, so good. \nRead more",

          "description": "Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. \nIt's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).\nRead more",

In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in \"revenge\" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA.

The amount of comfort I got from playing Alpha Centauri throughout, though, was a surprise.\nIt's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's \"send a colony ship into space\" ending could have asked \"what if lasers and aliens\", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?\nRead more",

In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.\nThis being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.\nRead more",

The free cooking game Little Chef disagreed, and dubbed my dish 'Eggy Mess'. Everyone's a critic. But it's fun to puzzle out potential recipes, dragging ingredients into the pot, brushing my cursor against little physics-simulated spoons and plant fronds, and discovering what fresh horror I've concocted.

          "description": "Immersive sims like Dishonored or System Shock can be very fulfilling, but they are also oddly stressful. After all, the flipside of the genre mantra of solving problems through imaginative application of the tools is that when you achieve a boring solution, that's all your fault. Did you miss the final jump while trying for a complex, third-storey infiltration in Deathloop, resulting in a sadly non-immersive firefight in the courtyard below? Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint? Shame on you! Don't you know how much imsims cost to develop? Go back to Open-Ended Systems School and retake that course in The Power of Choice. Also, consider playing Mosa Lina instead. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's an ultraportable 13-inch machine with high-end specs, a 1200p (1920x1200) 120Hz touchscreen and a detchable keyboard. Plug in Asus' discrete GPU (or any other eGPU solution), and you're left with an extremely powerful gaming machine - then unplug and you've got a thin and light laptop for getting work done or consuming media on the go. Nice. \nAnyway, this laptop retailed for $1300 when it first debuted last year, but now it's down to $700 at Woot in the US. That's a substantial savings and a good deal for a 13-inch laptop with a Core i5 12500H CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD. \nRead more",

The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status (\"This is my hole! It was made for me!\"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go \"Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito.\"\nThis isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.\nRead more",

          "description": "Occasionally, I'll try a \"weird controller\" challenge: I mean, playing things with a DDR mat is just a fun idea. But have you ever considered beating Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom bosses with an ocarina? \n\n\nReddit user gvmimi just did it. And for multiple fights, too!\n\nI beat the Wind Temple Boss with my Ocarina as a controller\nbyu/gvmimi intearsofthekingdom\n\n\nHere they are fighting the Wind Temple boss. And the Water Temple boss. And astonishingly, the Lightning Temple boss. Their goal is to beat the whole game with said Ocarina controller, which subs for a traditional control method for the Switch.\n\n\nHow are they doing it? As gvmimi notes: \"I have a program on my computer that allows me to map different musical notes/frequencies to different inputs.\" They also pointed out that they've cleared Breath of the Wild with an Ocarina, so their determination is now tenfold.\n\n\nZelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be talked about for years\n\n\nWhen I first experienced Tears of the Kingdom in complete isolation during the review period, I knew it was going to be big when it came to showing off emergent gameplay online (bold claim, I know!). There are just so many divergent puzzle solutions that it's a blast to see how someone else handled a problem. In fact, I specifically sought out other people who also cleared a lot of puzzles by throwing a bunch of stuff in a pile until it built a giant contraption. It was straight out of that scene in Home Alone 2 where Marv builds a little structure to help him and Harry get out of the basement of Uncle Rob and Aunt Georgette's townhouse.\n\n\nWhere was I? Oh, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a fun game to both play and watch: which is becoming a rarity as many other AAA games rely on old open world tropes.\n\nThe post A brave soul is beating Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom bosses with an Ocarina controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hyperstrange and Mekworx have announced that the second episode of the Early Access FPS Supplice has been released into the wild.\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar with it, Supplice is a new FPS built-in GZDoom. Kind of like Selaco but not quite as flashy and also available now. It’s being constructed by prominent Doom modders. I have the early access, but I’ve not made it much further than the second mission. That’s not a condemnation. I just got distracted and haven’t gone back. I guess you could interpret that as a condemnation of my attention span.\n\n\nThe new episode boasts five new missions, some new monsters to drill into, and “new environmental interactions. Whenever someone uses that word, I immediately think of flushing the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D. When Mekworx uses it, they mean sucking monsters out of airlocks. Those are two similar concepts, but one is much deadlier.\n\n\nSupplice follows Zorah Null as she shows up for her first day on a terraforming job to instead find monsters. It’s worth noting that, unlike Doom, Supplice has more of a narrative, complete with voice acting. Like many retro-inspired shooters, the idea is to blend old and modern design. The fact that it uses an old engine just makes it more convincing.\n\n\nSupplice is available in Early Access for PC already. The new episode is available now.\n\nThe post Supplice supplements itself with second episode appeared first on Destructoid.",

The highlight of the new season is the electrifying new Legend: Conduit. \n\n\nFor the first time ever, Cross Progression has also been added to Apex. Following the seasons electrical theme, the Storm Point map has also been energized and overhauled.\n\n\n\n\nElectrifying new Legend: Conduit\n\n\nA new support Legend, Conduit, makes her way to Apex Legends in Season 19. Her passive ability \"Savior's Speed\" gives her a burst of speed specifically when running towards allies outside of her Tactical range. This syncs up with her Tactical \"Radiant Transfer\" This ability causes Conduit to send out a surge of energy to a teammate, generating temporary shields to the ally and herself. Her ultimate \"Energy Barricade\" allows her to deploy an array of shield-jamming devices that damage and slow enemies in its range. With this arsenal, Conduit has a versatile kit allowing her to cut off enemy rotations.\n\n\nImage via Respawn Entertainment\n\n\nEnergized Storm Point & Cross Progression\n\n\nRevamps to the Storm Point map have reduced its size while amping up the intensity, leading to players getting into more fights quicker. Players can also explore Wattston's Town Takeover - Pylon and engage in fights at ZEUS Station. Following with the theme of Apex Legends: Ignite, the map is electrified.\n\n\nWith the implementation of Cross Progression, players can now brag about their collected cosmetics, badges, and achievements across all platforms and accounts. This means you can unlock a cosmetic on PC, then jump on your Xbox and still have that cosmetic.\n\n\nI've been out of the Apex Legends loop for a while now but this seems like a great time to jump in. Cross Progression is huge and caters to casual players like me who might want to jump in here and there on different platforms.\n\n\nApex Legends: Ignite goes live on all platforms on October 31.\n\nThe post Apex Legends Season 19 brings new Legend, Cross Progression, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can jump into the randomly generated action in just a couple weeks, on November 8.\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on Twitter, the official Risk of Rain account showcased a new character, the Pilot, designed to be a crowd-control prioritized combatant. Armed with a standard Clusterfire attack and a secondary attack called Target Acquired, players can make quick work of any enemies that cross their path. \n\n\nBut, they also look to be rather agile, which lets them put space between themselves and enemies. The Pilot also has a utility ability called Rapid Deployment, which makes good use of their parachute. \n\n\nRisk of Rain Returns is introducing The Pilot, in addition to another new survivor, The Drifter. The Drifter looks to be more of an up-close-and-personal melee fighter, using their sleeping bag and other everyday items as instruments of blunt force trauma. \n\n\nIn addition to Risk of Rain Returns’ release date, developer Hopoo Games also announced a celebration of the series’ community called The Festival of Gup, also set to occur live on Gearbox’s Twitch on November 8 at 10:30 a.m. PST / 12:30 p.m. CST / 1:30 p.m. EST. \n\n\nRisk of Rain Returns will be available for PC and Nintendo Switch on November 8.\n\nThe post Risk of Rain Returns returns on November 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It was recently brought to people's attention that the Master Collection of Metal Gear Solid was near unplayable on Steam Deck. Fortunately, Valve has been quick off the mark, and a fix is rolling out.\n\n\nAccording to a recent Twitter/X post from Pierre-Loup Grifais – coder for Valve – a hotifx has been deployed.  This should tend to the crashing issues people have been having with both Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.\n\n\n\n\nAs is often the case when it comes to the Steam Deck, the problem appeared to be related to compatibility issues with the device's operating system. This new patch – sent out literally moments ago – addresses issues with Proton, the Linux-based software the Deck is built around.\n\n\nWhat was the problem?\n\n\nIn a recent report/video from GamingOnLinux, the recent release of the first three Metal Gear Solid entries were shown to be not suited for the Deck. While MGS runs fine, it seems to maintain its old-school 4:3 aspect ratio, and the game is locked at 30fps. This may not be an issue for some, but others may take exception to the sizeable black borders and lower framerate.\n\n\nHowever, at least it was running on the device. The same could not be said for the second and third games, neither of which would play at all. Both Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater were crashing to the Steam Library, meaning they couldn't be played at all.\n\n\nGiven the popularity of the classic Metal Gear Solid games, it's not surprising Valve was pretty quick to act. Hopefully, MGS2 and MGS3 should run now, as the update's purpose is to \"address a blocking crash in cutscenes.\" At the time of writing, a fix for the missing audio in cutscenes is still being worked on.\n\nThe post Metal Gear Solid collection is messy on Steam Deck, but Valve is rolling out fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "League of Legends publisher Riot Games debuted another in-universe music group called Heartsteel, and their debut single \"Paranoia\" dropped earlier this week on October 23. Alongside the single, several new skins are being added to the MOBA. \n\n\n\n\nDespite the boy band being completely new to the LoL world, several members of Heartsteel may sound familiar. A few of Heartsteel's members are voiced by popular artists in real life; Kyan is voiced by Cal Scruby, K’Sante is voiced by Tobi Lou, Sett is voiced by Øzi, and Ezreal is voiced by Byun Baekhyun.\n\n\nHeartsteel-inspired skins make a debut \n\n\nPlayers of League of Legends will not only have a chance to enjoy Heartsteel’s music, but will also be able to mimic the looks of their favorite members with new skins for each member of Heartsteel in-game. Although each member will recieve their own skin, only Kayn and Yone will get different tiers of skins. Kayn is set to recieve a skin with a Legendary status while Yone is set to get a Prestige skin, in addition to their originals. \n\n\nFans can catch a glimpse of the new skins in Heartsteel's 'Paranoia' music video. Alongside the music video, an official skins trailer from Riot Games has also been released. The 'Paranoia' skins will be available to players on November 8.\n\n\n\n\nRiot Games has been debuting in-universe music groups for a while now. Some of their most popular groups were virtual K-pop group K/DA (2018) and hip hop group True Damage (2019). The in-universe music group approach that Riot Games has been taking is seeing a lot of success. K/DA blew many away with their debut single \"POP/STARS\" in 2018, which truly kicked off the League of Legends band legacy. \n\n\nHeartsteel is set to make a similarly large impact on the League of Legends universe through exciting music, entertaining visuals, and taking on the title of Riot’s first in-game boy band.\n\nThe post Heartsteel is the latest League pop crossover, with a new single and skins appeared first on Destructoid.",

While there's no release date for it just yet, the developer has at least tried to explain why it's taking so long.\n\n\nIn a post on the Payday website, Starbreeze Studios has issued yet another apology, acknowledging that it's been a bit quiet recently. However, the message \"lifts the curtain\" a little to give some insight into what the developer is working on.\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out the reasons behind the patch being delayed are \"long and complicated.\" As it transpires, the team has discovered \"critical errors\" which has lead to a \"significant risk to player progression being wiped\" if the problems aren't addressed.\n\n\nThere's light at the end of the tunnel\n\n\nFear not, though, as the update \"has been sent off and is currently going through a testing and certification process.\" Keep an ear out for further details as it sounds like the patch could be ready to launch soon. We just don't know when yet.\n\n\nUpon release, Payday 3 was met with largely negative feedback. For starters, unreliable matchmaking was causing headaches for many players. On top of that, the game requires a constant internet connection, even when playing solo. That alone was a thorn in many people's sides.\n\n\nWhile the patch has been delayed a couple of times already, many will be hopeful Starbreeze will be able to resolve the issues and get it sent out. The studio may also be considering an offline mode.\n\nThe post Reasons behind the Payday 3 update delay are “long and complicated” appeared first on Destructoid.",

As of right now, the studio is temporarily discounting quite a healthy selection of its releases.\n\n\nWe all know that Capcom has a myriad of choices, especially when it comes to horror, so it'll be quite unfortunate if you can't find at least one franchise that'll suit you.\n\n\n\n\nFor example: Resident Evil 4 Remake is currently 30% off (and comes as a special double pack featuring the Separate Ways DLC). Want more Resident Evil? How about Village for 60% off? Even the weaker entries (you know the ones) are discounted.\n\n\nYou can also get all the mainline Dead Rising games in a special Halloween Pack. Or maybe you have all the games mentioned above but want some DLC. Those are in the sale as well.\n\n\nThis devil...he may cry...\n\n\nOf course, if horror is not your thing, there are other things in the Capcom sale. The Monster Hunter and Street Fighter series are included in the discounts as well. As is Marvel vs. Capcom. \n\n\nHell, even Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is 34% off. You can check out everything that's currently on sale either by going to the developer's website or just heading straight to Steam. It looks like the event will be going on until November 7, so you've got a bit of time to decide.\n\nThe post A bunch of Capcom games are on sale in time for Halloween appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bungie is, according to the latest information, bound to rework how Shaders work with 2024's The Final Shape DLC.\n\n\nIt's an unexpected reveal that's come from a fairly unassuming source: a recent livestream posted by Destiny 2 streamer Datto. Players have been asking for a better way to preview, filter, and group shaders for the longest time now, with threads explaining these cosmetics popping up every so often. \n\n\nThe crux of the issue, really, comes from the fact that even though the Shaders' icons only show four colours and textures at a time, they actually hold way more of them, which can lead to situations where one picks a mostly grey shader, only for it to apply …",

The simplified action from developer Nao Games will be available on the Nintendo eShop for $14.99. Pre-order and you'll get 10 percent off. Beyond its roguelite stylings, the main hooks for Ninja or Die are its speed and one-button controls. As detailed way back when we first took a look at it, you jump to where you point and slash through foes. \n\n\nYou can see a very brief sample in Marvelous Europe's announcement.\n\n\n\n\nNinja nonsense\n\n\nThe story of Ninja or Die has you taking on the role of a pickpocket who becomes a deadly, lightning-fast ninja. The cataclysm that caused this change also turned the ramen seller into a samurai and the maiko into a lethal geisha. Now everyone finds themselves trapped in a chaotic loop. That's where the roguelite aspects come into play. Death can be overcome with the help of permanent upgrades and stat boosts at your village. \n\n\nWith its focus on replayability, Ninja or Die might end up being a solid fit for Switch. It's a tough entry in the sub-genre that lives up to its speedy claims. We'll see how repeat runs pan out on Nintendo's console when the ninja world unfolds before us very soon. \n\nThe post Ninja or Die brings simplified roguelite action to Switch on November 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will arrive for PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS on November 9, 2023.\n\n\nBerzerk Recharged is an updated version of the classic 1980 arcade game by Alan McNeil. It’s maybe not as well-remembered as titles like Pac-Man or Space Invaders, but Berzerk is pretty great in its own right. The 2600 port is among my favorite games on the system, even though I’m not a huge fan of that era of games. There’s just something about the feel of Berzerk that gets my endorphins pumping.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t think you’ve ever heard of the game, it was referenced in Futurama’s season one episode, \"Fear of a Bot Planet.\" Two robots quote the game, saying, “Get the humanoid. Get the Intruder.”\n\n\nAs part of Sneakybox’s Recharged line of games, Berzerk Recharged will be updated with new visuals, leaderboards, and power-ups, and progression. Most importantly, I feel, is the addition of a twin-stick control scheme. 1975’s Gunfight was the first game to use the control scheme, while it would later be popularized by 1982’s Robotron 2084. I really started digging it after I played 1990’s Smash T.V., which was a spiritual successor to Robotron. I’m getting off-track here, but twin-stick is a great control scheme and should definitely benefit Berzerk’s formula.\n\n\nBerzerk Recharged will release for PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS on November 9, 2023. Also, as a reminder, Berzerk Enhanced Edition will launch on Atari 2600 on November 17th alongside the Atari 2600+.\n\nThe post Atari has announced Berzerk Recharged will be released on November 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bram Stoker published his iconic novel Dracula in 1897. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBram's great-grandnephew Dacre Stoker created the StokerVerse label alongside his partner Chris McAuley. The duo aims to publish games, comics, and novels under the StokerVerse banner. Each of these is inspired by the works of Bram Stoker. \n\n\nBecause Dark Reign sports the StokerVerse license, it's able to take a deep dive into the world of the 1897 novel. Players will take on the role of the story's protagonist, Jonathan Harker, as he attempts to escape the vampire's castle. The upcoming Game Boy Color Metroidvania title even features a never-before-seen prologue to the original book that's pulled from Bram Stoker's personal notes. \n\n\nIncube8 Games promises a \"unique blend of storytelling, exploration, and action\" within Dracula: Dark Reign. All of which is based on Stoker's source material from many, many years ago. \n\n\nDracula: Dark Reign makes its physical Game Boy Color cartridge debut in 2024 for $59.99. A future Digital Edition is also planned that will be playable via PC or Mac emulators. A demo is available for players to try out on the Dracula: Dark Reign demo page. \n\nThe post A Castlevania-style Bram Stoker’s Dracula game is coming to Game Boy Color appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Publisher Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic revealed today that the upcoming medieval strategy title Manor Lords has a release date. Players will be able to don the mantle of Medieval Lord as they oversee their own medieval manor on April 26. Manor Lords will also launch as a Day One title on Game Pass for PC.\n\n\n\n\nYes, mi'lord?\n\n\nManor Lords features a unique playstyle, allowing players to manage the city-building of their manor while also fighting off threats such as bandits and rival lords. As a lord, players will exploit the local resources to build up their castle and surrounding kingdom. As you expand your settlement you will establish trade routes and master your surroundings as you seek to meet the demands of your people.\n\n\nIn terms of combat, Manor Leads features a real-time tactical combat system where you rally your working population in your manor as militia to join you on the battlefield. As your military is also your workforce, each death on the battlefield can result in a labor shortage once the war is over.\n\n\nIt was also revealed that Manor Lords will eventually make its way to consoles as well, at which time it will also be a Day One on Xbox title.\n\n\nI've had my eye on Manor Lords since it was revealed. There was a demo during a Steam Next Fest months ago and I know a lot of people enjoyed it. Even though I didn't get a chance to play it, the bits I saw looked like quite an experience. It looks like things have been even further optimized as well. It's always cool when you get to build things and then also go down in first person and explore.\n\n\nManor Lords releases on April 26 on PC and as a Day One on Game Pass title.\n\nThe post Manor Lords releases in April and is Day One on Game Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over 200 microgames are on the menu for WarioWare: Move It!, and a new trailer is here to show how to control those forms.\n\n\nNintendo shared a three-minute overview of the next entry in the speedy series. This one offers up a better idea of all the poses you'll need to contort your body into through each game. There's shaking, dancing, punching, wiggling, and plenty of nose-picking throughout. The new footage from Nintendo's latest trailer shows off both singleplayer and local multiplayer modes. \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to highlighting forms, the trailer previews Museum Mode, which lets you choose from microgames and practice at different speeds. Party mode lets two to four players compete against one another in five different games. There are the bizarro rules of Galactic Conquest and the order-following Listen to the Doctor. Medusa March has you crawling a dungeon while avoiding the stone-cold stare of Medusa herself. Go the Distance puts you through a microgame gauntlet with your dukes up. Finally, you can test your guessing game skills in The Who's in Control show, which requires four players. \n\n\nScreenshot via Nintendo YouTube\n\n\nWah, Wah, Yeah!\n\n\nLike previous WarioWare games, there's a Story Mode that lets you play through stages featuring different characters. All the stages put the spotlight on their own forms to keep you on your toes. It looks as ridiculous as ever, even if some of it will no doubt depend on how many friends you can wrangle together for local multiplayer. WarioWare: Move It! hits Nintendo Switch around the world on November 3, 2023. \n\nThe post WarioWare: Move It! busts all the moves in Party Mode and minigame overview appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No More Robots has announced that Cheesemaker’s ghostly bathhouse game, Spirittea is set to release on November 13 for Switch, Xbox (on GamePass), and PC. Alongside the announcement is an 8-minute in-depth look at the game.\n\n\nSpirittea is a management quest game (think Stardew Valley) inspired by Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away. You play as a writer, trying to get some peace to pen your next novel. Drinking from the wrong teapot causes the spirit realm to fold over into reality. You’re given the keys to a bathhouse, where you then scrub down spirits and help them relax.\n\n\n\n\nCheesemaker describes Spirittea as a “life sim, management game, and detective game all in one.” Essentially, that means you help the townsfolk exorcise the ghosts that are bothering them, which you then try to accommodate within your bathhouse. The bathhouse can be upgraded, which is necessary to attract some of the spirits. Beyond that is a life simulator with four seasons that affect what quests you can accomplish.\n\n\nThis might be exactly what I need right now. Management games tend to be my go-to for relaxation. I can definitely dig the Mother 3-style art, though it’s a bit jarring when a character portrait comes up, and they’re much more realistically drawn. Nonetheless, the Spirited Away influence is obvious, and that’s something I can totally dig. I think I’ll probably play this one.\n\n\nSpirittea is coming to Switch, Xbox, and PC on November 13, 2023. There’s a demo available for it right now.\n\nThe post Ghost scrubbing simulator Spirittea arrives on November 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

To add to that, not only has Bethesda's newest release been played by more than 11 million people so far, it's also been a major achievement for Game Pass.\n\n\nThat's according to a recent Microsoft earnings call, which took place on October 24. Among a bunch of other wins for the tech giant, Starfield has done wonders for the Xbox subscription service. According to the transcript (or you could listen to the whole audio if you prefer), the deep space adventure set a new record for the \"most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever.\"\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 11 million people that have taken to the stars, almost half of them played the game on PC. The transcript goes on to say that Starfield's launch has \"benefited Xbox content and services.\"\n\n\nThe rich get richer\n\n\nIn gaming overall, Microsoft has said that revenue has \"increased 9% and 8% in constant currency\" with a \"better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass.\" No prizes for guessing which game is pretty much responsible for this uptick (no, not Redfall. Why would you say that?).\n\n\nThe hype behind Starfield was pretty immense for what felt like a long time. Given that it's Bethesda's first game since Microsoft bought the company in 2021, Xbox put its muscle behind the space-faring RPG.\n\n\nMany of us might be losing a bit of interest in the game now, but the revenue and player count show just how popular Skyrim-in-space has been. But will it last as long as The Elder Scrolls 5? Only time will tell (I say no).\n\nThe post More than 11 million people have played Starfield, Microsoft says appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. \n\n\nVersion 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue.

The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.\nAt the time, \"The Avenger Initiative\" felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. \nA new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.\nThe open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. \n\n\nPlayers will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. \nThe open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.",

In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.\nWhile what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the \"first in-engine look.\" Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a \"pre-alpha footage\" tag.\nCheck out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. \nRevealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. \nHere are a few screenshots from today's showing: \n\nFor more Metal Gear, check out Game Informer's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 PlayStation 5 New Gameplay Today. \nAre you excited for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater?

A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.\nThe Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.\nNonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.",

This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs.

Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.\n\n\nDark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. \nStar Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

          "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 last week and it's already Sony's fastest-selling first-party game ever. However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game's main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare. \nIn response to a tweet by Dantes61680 pointing out the incorrect flag, Insomniac's director of community and marketing James Stevenson wrote, \"Fix is coming for that.\" As for when, that remains unclear – a post-launch patch for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has not yet been released but presumably, when the …",

An Important Dated Message Brought to You By Your Friends at @PrimeVideo. pic.twitter.com/yyaFynVjAK\nOctober 23, 2023\nAs is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios' own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.\nOver the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO's The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year.

The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.\nThis feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless. \n\n\nWe’ve enjoyed our time with Peter and Miles, and you can read our thoughts by checking out our Spider-Man 2 review here.

The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.\nThe collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.\nWe had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.\nAs for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. \nCheck out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. \nBuying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. \nFor more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.\nAre you jumping into Ghostrunner 2 next week?

Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. \nSpeaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.\nCheck out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paradox Rift arrives on store shelves on November 3.

The two main collectibles come in the form of 10 Flower Coins and Wonder Seeds. Each main stage has three 10 Flower Coins for you to collect, while each main stage features at least two Wonder Seeds for you to grab. While the Wonder Seeds are tied to each exit a stage has, you also get one for collecting a Wonder Flower and completing the corresponding Wonder Effect. \nBelow, you'll see the locations of every single 10 Flower Coin (we'll just call them Flower Coins from here on out) and Wonder Seed.

It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.\nOne Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Stevenson said, \"No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1.\"\nNo - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1\nOctober 17, 2023\nAfter someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. \nSomeone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it \"should be before end of year.\"\nShould be before end of year\nOctober 18, 2023\nSo if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch.

It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.\nFor a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game \"inspiring\".\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. \nIt was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney.
