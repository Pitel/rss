          "description": "A different kind of 'game card'.\nIf you have ever read up on the history of Nintendo, you know that before it went into the video game business, the company began life by making cards and other novelties. The hanafuda and playing cards which Nintendo produced from its formation in 1889 took a back seat following the popularity of toys like the Ultra Hand in the 1960s, and the company would soon move into electronic games and, ultimately, arcade and video games.\nBut this is not to say that the company left cards behind completely. Nintendo-branded Japanese Menko cards were released in Japan in the early 1980s and collector Ben Gilmore has a sizeable colletion of these lesser-known Nintendo-branded cards. This milk cap/Pog-like tabletop game is older than Nintendo itself, and there are Nintendo Menkos with Mario designs that date from the plumber's pre-NES arcade days.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Zion investigates.\nThe start of this week saw the closure of the 3DS and Wii U eShops, a sad time for all of us, many of whom spent last weekend feeling a little sentimental about all of the brilliant games that we would be losing as we attempted to download as many titles as possible (not speaking from personal experience, of course). But what does this closure mean for the 3DS' other features? Just three months into what we declared \"the year of 3DS StreetPass,\" could the feature really be dying just as we were getting started?\nThis is the precise question that our lovely video producer, Zion, attempted to answer this week. As many of you may be aware, Zion has been making a public push for the return of StreetPass ever since the start of 2023 — we even held a StreetPass event at this year's PAX West. Aside from providing an update on how this journey has been going so far, the latest video explains the reality of Streetpass in 2023, how the eShop closure has affected the feature, and what its future might look like.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It brings a world of flying cars and corrupt mega-corporations to life with vibrant pixel graphics and rotoscope animation. At its best moments, Lunark is an effective love letter to the cinematic platformer, a genre of gaming that doesn’t get much attention these days. Occasionally, though, it serves to remind us how far game design has come.\nLoading up Lunark is just like entering a time machine. Everything in the game, from the music to the plot to the overall aesthetic, is inspired by the cinematic platformer genre. Unlike Mario, who can turn in mid-air to make physically impossible jumps look easy, our hero Leo’s movements are grounded in some aspect of reality. He’s got momentum and weight to him as he traverses the caverns, factories, and prisons he finds himself exploring.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?\nWired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.\nHis time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”\n Read more",

I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. \nLuckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.\nRead more",

I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.\nI suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?\nRead more",

Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”\r\n \nRead more",

This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.\r\n\n\r\n Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating.

It’s out now, it’s free, and it’s only about ten minutes long.\nRead more",

          "description": "Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.\nPlaying with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.\nRead more",

My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.\nSo yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.\nRead more",

          "description": "A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.\nSo what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.\nRead more",

There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. \nIt was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website.

          "description": "There’s always been something quaintly practical about the name Command & Conquer. Sure, there’s a touch of Julius Caesar’s ‘veni, vidi, vici’ in there. But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.\r\n\nBack then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.\nRead more",

In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it's definitely the latter. The free demo is out now, and throws you into the first couple of puzzles for the game as Alex, whose last memory is of being at home in her apartment. Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company. It was enough to staple this game right into the middle of my disorganised Charlie Day conspiracy board of games I'm interested in, I'll tell you that much.\nRead more",

          "description": "As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. \"You want him to get attacked,\" game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.\nIn truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.\nRead more",

My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure.

You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.\nThere are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One).

But he wasn't quite sure what. \"I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'\" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. \"Okay!?\" Humble says incredulously. \"I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it.\"\nSo began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. \"I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,\" says Humble. \"Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.\" And what was standing in the way of that freedom?

It's perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.\nRead more",

It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed.

Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.\nFrom playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.\n Read more",

          "description": "We've had our eyes on Goodbye Volcano High since it appeared in Sony's State Of Play back in February and the demo at PAX East is one of the first times that the devs have placed a game preview in the hands of eager players. I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP's teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you're interested to know what I thought:\nGoodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It's part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.\nI had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won't have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.\n Read more",

          "description": "It's almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that's exactly what we've done at PAX East. There's a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we've chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.\nEverything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West's multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it's nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.\nSome of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.\n Read more",

          "description": "“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we've only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”\r\n\n\r\nEvery so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes. The whole thing is kind of metal, to be honest.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The bug, which is present in all versions of Resident Evil 4, can be activated in Chapter 12 of the survival horror adventure.\n\"Please be aware of a rare but critical progress bug. This issue will only occur under very specific circumstances, as detailed below,\" warned Capcom in a message posted to Twitter.\n\"A cutscene will play at the beginning of Chapter 12, after which the player will receive a key item. Please refrain from attacking with the knife until the notification for obtaining this item is displayed in the upper right of the screen. After obtaining this key item, it will appear in the Key Items & Treasures menu in the attaché case. If it has not appeared, please reload saved data from before the start of Chapter 12.”\n\"We're working on a fix and apologize for any inconvenience.\"\nLaunching on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on March 24, Resident Evil 4 has seen immediate success, shifting over three million copies in its first two days of release and immediately becoming the fast-selling of the three semi-recent Resident Evil remakes. The opening of the Japanese stock market this morning saw Capcom shares hit their highest price ever, kicking off what is set to be an incredible year for the long-time developer/publisher.\nThe post Capcom warn fans of ‘critical’ Resident Evil 4 Chapter 12 bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Do you think Niven got royalties?\nThis week's Arcade Archives entry is a particularly curious case, as publisher Hamster has reached right back into the dawning days of the coin-op era to present us with Namco's Navarone — Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased way back in 1980 — the same year that Namco would blow the whole scene wide open with its seminal release, Pac-Man — Navarone is a single-screen shmup that tasks the player with circling a battlefield, blasting away at gun encampments and debris in an effort to destroy the central base located at the center of the screen. It is similar, in a fashion, to titles like Atari's Centipede, although it offers more in the way of return fire, as well as movement across three sides of the game screen.\nCheck out the exceptionally old-school action below, courtesy of Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa_k2xFH69g&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming\nBeautifully, the title attempts to sell the title as an adaptation of sorts to J. Lee Thompson's legendary 1961 movie The Guns of Navarone, itself an adaptation of Alistair MacLean's 1957 novel. One can only assume that this was not, however, an officially licensed Columbia Pictures product, which may go some way to explaining why Navarone would not receive a release outside of Japan. Besides, once Pac-Man Fever gripped the planet, the lo-fi thrills of Navarone would quickly fade into the background.\nNavarone is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s 1980 shooter Navarone joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

The xenomorphs have been tackled in shooters, Pac-Man-style mazes, and of course, raw horror. With Aliens: Dark Descent, the player takes command of a crack squad of commandos, heading into derelict depths of space that may or may not be crawling with the multi-mouthed creepy crawlies.\nThe question, really, was whether a narrow focus on just a squad of units, with individual talents and a high risk of immediate doom, could incorporate the tension and fear one might look for in an Aliens game. The answer is yes, it is extremely tense, and has some really cool ways of conveying the omnipresent fear of the xenomorphs. But it's a little complicated.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/wa…",

It’s a formula that has been utilized many times, and frequently the changes are very small. Most of the time, you maneuver your spaceship, unicorn, or spaceship with boxing gloves around on an automatically scrolling background until a much larger boss shows up.\nI can’t say that Axelay is much different. The formula could be described as a close companion to Life Force or Abadox where it alternates between vertical and horizontal scrolling stages. Its weapon system is a little lackluster.

Focusing on quick speed and chunky polygonal graphics, it tries to recapture the yesteryear of arcade racing. Despite its retro focus, the developers have tried to put in some more realistic features into it, including how the suspension works and the track design.\nhttps://youtu.be/_Jz4K2Q_fMM\nIt’s also the sequel to 2020’s Formula Retro Racing. It uses the same art style while trying to expand the game in every way, offering more tracks, polish, and even a VR mode. The developers have said they plan on expanding and improving the game over at least the next three months.\nI played a bit of Formula Retro Racing: World Tour, and it’s maybe not for me. I like retro racers, but I normally think back to San Francisco Rush. It leans a little more into simulation design than I prefer. I’d rather have dinosaurs and UFOs on the track, or failing that, let me drive a school bus. That said, it does feel like a relatively tight experience, and there’s a lot more content here than there was in the original 2020 title.\nFormula Retro Racing: World Tour is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S for $19.99.\nThe post Formula Retro Racing: World Tour parallel parks on PC, Switch, and Xbox today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, a brand new Sonic game, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, is available for free on Steam.\nA new mystery visual novel from Sega and the Sonic social crew, this is emphatically not a Sonic Team production. It is, however, a (head)canon title. You can find the Steam page right here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC8sIhr-z5I\nThe Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is set aboard the Mirage Express, where tragedy has struck in the midst of Amy Rose's birthday celebration. A murder mystery party with Sonic as the victim does seem like it's turning partially foul though, and it's up to you, the player, to get to the bottom of things.\nThe adventure is set up in a classic point-and-click style, with characters from throughout the Sonic universe showing up for the festivities. It is rated E for Everyone, so it's unclear whether full-on murder is on or off the table. But you know what, I like the energy either way.\n[caption id=\"attachment_371944\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Sega[/caption]\nA good fool\nWe are coming up on the one day a year where many companies try to do some kind of joke or ribbing, to historically mixed results. Ranging from googly eyes and \"Horse Mode\" to fake game announcements, some of my least favorite ones are usually a game idea that makes you go, \"hey wait, don't joke, that's a good idea.\"\nSo in that light, I'm happy to see The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, a Poirot-infused mystery adventure starring the Sonic crew, be an actually real thing. It's a fun surprise. Hopefully this is a good omen for what's yet to be announced over the next 24 hours.

He should, perhaps, be better known for the swaths of interactive fiction he created, including 1983’s Suspended and 1997’s Zork: The Undiscovered Underground.\nMike co-founded Eidetic Studios with Mark Blank (then known as Blank, Berlyn, and Co) but decided to exit the video game industry entirely during the creation of 1999’s Syphon Filter. At the time, he expressed frustration with those at the top of the industry. He always seemed to be someone who stuck to his guns, and that’s commendable.\nHe will be remembered for the incredible work he did in the early days of the industry, and we at Destructoid offer our sincere condolences to his friends and family.\nLead image via MobyGames.\nThe post Bubsy designer Mike Berlyn dies at 73 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even before the remake came around and remixed some of the game's most iconic sections, pretty much everyone had a favorite in mind. With the remake under your belt, what wins out this time around? Or if you haven't played the remake, just sound off anyway!\nThe castle is one of the best action locales ever made\nEven the precipice of the castle sets the tone right away. Everyone involved (including the castle's lord Ramon Salazar) isn't messing around, and these denizens are an immediate step up compared to the enemies that populate the village. They have weaponry, tactics, traps, and some surprises. Taking on a pack of castle Ganados is one of the most thrilling aspects of the game, particularly with some of the new engine and action tweaks in the remake.\nThe castle has it all: variety, creepy unique enemies, indoor and outdoor combat, and Resident Evil style puzzles. The remake takes things even further than the original in several areas (which I won't spoil here), and tweaks most of the Ashley-centric segments for the better. Hopefully, it ends up making a return in the upcoming Mercenaries mode: its ominous theming and dynamic layout will be a blast to play over and over.\nThe other two don't slouch, though\nThe additions to the village zone really set the tone early on, and let me know that this was in fact a remake and not a remaster. Similarly, the island keeps you on your toes and lets you go full action hero without having to babysit Ashley; plus Krauser is always a delight to beat down. I do miss some of the original areas, but the remake (alongside the VR edition) is definitely going to be getting some play in the years ahead.\nRelated: What Engine is the Resident Evil 4 Remake Running On? on PrimaGames\nThe post What’s your favorite area in Resident Evil 4? appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is why today, a little more than two-and-a-half years after it first launched, the game is getting its final content update.\nAs explained in January, Update 2.8 will be the last content patch for Marvel's Avengers before official support ends later this year. The patch unlocks the marketplace, adding nearly all MCU and non-MCU-inspired outfits, nameplates, takedowns, and…",

It's the type of game everyone needs to play for themself to see if they vibe with it. Some people won't, others definitely do, and this bit of news is for the latter group. Today, the developers at poncle announced new paid DLC for the indie darling is coming in about two weeks. Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari includes the new forest map, Lake Foscari, which is home to the Foscari Academy where parents send their kids to be wizards, warriors, and spies. Lake Foscari is described as a \"continent-size forest\" which the developers say will contain multiple biomes, similar to the map from the Legacy of the Moonspell DLC.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iZVpnu5Dmc\nThe DLC will also add eight new characters to Vampire Survivor as well as 13 new weapons and seven new music tracks. If the kazoo in the trailer is giving you PTSD flashbacks to the very worst of the Yoshi franchise, know that it's only for the trailer and not representative of what you'll hear in the new songs.\nAs with the last bit of DLC for the game, Tides of the Foscari will only set players back $1.99 when it releases on April 13, 2023.\nRelated: The 10 best mods for Vampire Survivors on Gamepur\nThe post Vampire Survivors is about to take your butt to school appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not only does the darker tone intrigue me (both in terms of how they can capitalize on it and/or falter with going in that darker direction), but the action-centric gameplay is something I want to experience right now. Well, we're all about to experience it together soon, as XVI is [likely] not getting a patented last-minute Square Enix delay: it actually just went gold.\nThe Final Fantasy XVI release date holds\nhttps://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1641758683129344010\nAs announced on the game's official Twitter account, Final Fantasy XVI has gone gold and will launch as planned on PS5 on June 22, 2023. That's good news! If you're looking forward to Final Fantasy XVI that is.\nSo far, so good: but there are a lot of expectations\nAs a reminder, we had a comprehensive first-hand look at Final Fantasy XVI recently, and our own Eric Van Allen came away impressed. But of course, there are sky-high expectations for this mainline entry, especially given the additional context of the polarized reception to XV, and the high ongoing quality of XIV that has fans on edge. He said it best in his preview:\n\"My main takeaway from playing Final Fantasy XVI is that Square Enix is not making a half-hearted effort at an action-RPG. From the team that’s been assembled to the way combat feels fast and engaging, XVI certainly feels like a fresh and different take from what’s come before it. The ultimate question is whether it can make the action still feel that good across a vast RPG adventure, and if fans both new and old latch onto this.\"\n\nThe post Final Fantasy XVI has gone gold and I can’t wait to see how it compares to the classics appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developers faxdoc, happyquared, sunnydaze, and publisher Playism have confirmed that Rusted Moss will land on PC via Steam on April 12.\nThis twin-stick, side-scrolling shooter has some definite Metroid vibes. With the same sort of grid-based map and world to explore, it feels a bit familiar. But its own unique quality lies in the grappling hook.\nOne of Rusted Moss' core features is a grapple, letting the protagonist Fern hook and swing across the world. That, plus big guns, makes for a pretty fast and active side-scrolling shooter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iteSJWwSaAg\nIt's a full-on twin-stick shooter too, so no limits on what direction you can point. Add in some big, chaotic boss fights, and this feels like a search-action game made for folks who want a little more adrenaline in their secret hunting.\nThe hook brings you back\nI've played the demo for Rusted Moss a few times, at PAX and through events like Steam demo festivals. Heck, the demo for Rusted Moss has stayed live and is playable right now if you head over to the store page.\nEach time, I've really enjoyed the mix of movement and shooting that feels like it's got shades of Titanfall or Spider-Man. It's punishing in a good way, though I definitely recommend tinkering with the grapple options to find the playstyle that suits you best.\nWith April looking a little light compared to the heavy-hitters of May and June, it might be a good time to check out a smaller title like Rusted Moss. The demo's there either way, and if it hooks you in, the full game hits on April 12.\nThe post Grapple-swinging shooter Rusted Moss arrives on Steam in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

Windy Meadow bills itself as a “counterpart” to Roadwarden rather than a sequel or spin-off.\nDid you play Roadwarden? I completely missed it. Looking at it now, I think I’m going to need to make time for it. The publisher calls it as a “slice of life” narrative where you immerse yourself in the goings-on of a small community where decisions matter.\nhttps://youtu.be/P6VRhcTW3k4\nWhat interests me about Windy Meadow is that, although it’s considered a visual novel, “99%” of the text is dialogue. The visuals instead do the heavy lifting of communicating what’s happening. While I understand why developers use static images to communicate their stories since video games are a visual medium, that tends to go unutilized by the genre. So, that’s something I’d like to see experimented with.\nThe publisher says the narrative “seamlessly weaves coziness and melancholy,” which is also how I’d describe eating a sandwich from Arby’s in bed. The story puts you in the footwear of three separate protagonists, with different paths for each.\nSound fantastic. I’m probably going to pick up Roadwarden soon, but if you’re more interested in what you’re hearing here, there’s a demo available starting today.\nWindy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale will release for PC sometime this year.\nThe post Windy Meadow spins off of Roadwarden this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It deserves the comeback\nBack in 2014 I covered a game from Grumpyface Studios called Castle Doombad. I'm already a sucker for projects featuring traps as the core mechanic, but Doombad was sleek, cute, and a blast to play in short bursts or long sessions. Sadly, like many mobile games of that era (particularly under the Adult Swim banner), it was eventually put out to pasture. Given that it's miraculously coming back this year on Steam (self-published by Grumpyface no less), it'll likely have a longer shelf life.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix66i9eYX4M\nIn what is still a fun twist, you're playing the role of the bad guy (Dr. Lord Evilstein). Much like a tower defense game or an action trapper like Deception or Orcs Must Die, your job is to use all sorts of gadgets (mounted on walls, the floor, or the ceiling) and minions to defend your castle. It has a really striking cartoony aesthetic to back it all up, and seeing Dr. Lord Evilstein cradle his fingers as he operates within the confines of his private office will never get old for me.\nHere's what the 2023 version has that the original mobile release didn't:\nRemastered/remade visuals\n35 traps/minions to use\nGamepad/mouse and keyboard support\nNew content\nLive now on Steam in wishlist form, it's set to debut later in 2023. There's also a website with links to the team's Discord channel and Twitter accounts. Even if the new content isn't substantial, I hope a ton of people get to play this clever creation for the first time.\nThe post Underrated trap-based puzzler Castle Doombad is coming back this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area.

Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.\n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft skipping E3? Do you expect the event to still take place?

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nWhile waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nCrash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nAre you interested in Crash Team Rumble?

We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
