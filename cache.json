In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. \"Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op,\" say publishers Devolver.

Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It's got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.\n \nRead more",

Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.\nSadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?\nGranted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...\nRead more",

While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.)

Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. \r\n\n\r\nI am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and \"small interactive moments\" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It's a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.\r\n\r\nInstead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations. I've played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you'll find some thoughts from my time with it below.\n Read more",

The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. \nRead more",

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don't get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.\nRead more",

How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber.

Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of \"free\" and \"vegan\" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.",

Some models are also already available for pre-order ahead of launch day. This is quite nice compared to in the past there was often at times quite a delay between the initial AMD Ryzen mobile announcements and being able to (pre)order any hardware.

Console playtesting will also be launching this Fall to give players a little taste of gameplay and get it ready for its full launch. \n\n\nBased on the trailer, M-Corp has now gone as skaters infiltrate San Vansterdam. The corporation previously had a hold of the city, but their misdeeds have finally caught up to them. Fortunately for the skaters, they can now safely travel around San Vansterdam, showing off a few gnarly tricks. \n\n\n\n\nSign-ups for the console playtest are now available via the Skate. page. It'll give you a chance to see what the studio has been working on, even though it's still in its testing period. Users can then provide any feedback on the game to help shape Skate.'s official launch. \n\n\nPrevious Skate. playtests only centered around PC and mobile versions, including the EA App. Nevertheless, the game will continue to expand with its console iterations. You may also get the chance to participate in other playtests, where Electronic Arts may invite you back for another round. \n\n\nSince Skate. is still in development, there isn't a set release date as right now. However, we do know that it will be available to play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC.

The game will be available to play on Oct. 11, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. \n\n\nIn the trailer, we see plenty of iconic Dragon Ball universe characters, from Piccolo to Frieza. Based on the snippets in the latest debut and the official page, the game will follow along with the franchise's classic storyline. This includes one of the most beloved arcs with Dragon Ball Z's Cell Games saga. We also got a look at Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero pre-order bonuses showcasing exclusive Gogeta and Broly forms. However, one playable character still remains a mystery. \n\n\n\n\nDragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will continue on the fan-favorite Budokai Tenkaichi series. It will carry on the gameplay of past iterations, only this time in the modern gaming age. You can essentially think of Sparking! Zero as the fourth installment of Budokai Tenkaichi. \n\n\nThe last time we saw a BT entry was back in 2007 with Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3. Given that it's now 2024, a new entry has certainly been a long time coming. It will also be very different from its predecessor with its online play, where players can test their skills against other Dragon Ball fans. \n\n\nMark your calendars for Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero's Oct. 11, 2024 debut. It's currently available for pre-orders and offers Standard, Collector's, and Deluxe Editions. \n\nThe post Dragon Ball: Sparking!

Although the TV show has yet to get an official release date, the snippet provides an exciting \"Coming Soon\" teaser.   \n\n\nThe trailer begins with Among Us characters making a delicious pizza until a monster decides to disrupt the peace. This creature seems to be on the hunt for them, similar to all the murderous takedowns the game is known for. \n\n\n\n\nCBS Studios and Innersloth Production are behind the show, featuring a star-studded cast. This includes many notable actors, including Elijah Wood, Patton Oswalt, Ashley Johnson, and Randall Park. I'm a big fan of the entire cast and Among Us, so it'll be exciting to see them blend together in the animated series. \n\n\nIn addition to the Among Us TV show, we also got a look into Innersloth's indie game fund, Outersloth. The funding will help other indie studios, catering to a lineup of several games. For instance, the Summer Game Fest 2024 mentions entries like Shape Shop's Mars First Logistics and Midnight Munchies' One BTN Bosses. \n\n\n\n\nSFG also provided an inside look into a new entry with Project Dosa. It's made by Outerloop Games, the studio behind Thirsty Suitors. While it would've been great to hear about a possible Among Us sequel, the animated series will at least fill that void. \n\n\nWe'll still need to wait on a release date for the Among Us TV show, but hopefully, it will come out sooner rather than later. \n\nThe post Among Us animated series gets a monstrous trailer with star-studded cast appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition to the gameplay, we also got a confirmed release date of Nov. 8, 2024. \n\n\nSlitterhead's gameplay trailer features a plethora of grotesque monsters, from a mantis-looking fiend to a slimy worm. The trailer then moves on to its playable characters, who take the enemies down one by one. In particular, a character can be seen initiating a claw-like attack that brutally slices up the creatures. \n\n\n\n\nOther playable characters are shown in the trailer, but this time with a new slot of weapons. Slitterhead seems to feature a variety of fighters to choose from, each with their own robust power. One character is shown to have a powerful shotgun, while another wields a powerful light machine gun. You can even teleport to other locations to make a quick getaway from the monsters. \n\n\nSlitterhead was first introduced during the Game Awards 2021 with a short teaser. Bokeh Game Studio is behind the project, which was established by Silent Hill's creator, Keiichiro Toyama. So, if you're a Silent Hill fan, you should definitely give this one a try for a brand-new horror experience. \n\n\nBe sure to tune into Slitterhead's release on Nov. 8, 2024.

This is the first we've seen from Phantom Blade Zero since it was revealed at the PlayStation Showcase last year. The action RPG focuses on deep fast-paced combat in a fictious world that meshes Chinese martial arts and Steampunk together.\n\n\n\n\nWith how ambitious Phantom Blade Zero looked in 2023 followed by a year of nothing new, I was starting to get a little worried. However, this gameplay trailer alleviated all my concerns. It looks as though Phantom Blade Zero is pulling in elements of a ton of successful titles including Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Ghost of Tsushima. \n\n\nI know that any trailer can be intentionally designed to look a certain way, but the fluidity of the combat in this gameplay trailer looks absolutely insane. The player quickly weaves in attacks while jumping over attacks and parrying or dodging others. I can't wait to hear more about how some of the more RPG-centric elements work.\n\n\nDeveloper S-Game confirmed that there will be hands-on experiences to play Phantom Blade Zero throughout the year, including at Summer Game Fest 2024, Tokyo Game Show, and Gamescom.\n\n\nPhantom Blade Zero does not yet have a release timeframe but will be released on both PlayStation 5 and PC.\n\nThe post Phantom Blade Zero gameplay looks incredibly fast-paced and exciting appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's also when pre-orders for a physical run of Alan Wake 2 open up, too. \n\n\nIn Alan Wake 2's additional saga, three characters will contend with the Dark Place again in self-contained episodes. According to its PlayStation Blog description, those tales play out with familiar,  but new, faces in a TV show the tortured artist once wrote for, Night Springs.\n\n\n\n\nNotable Remedy/Alan Wake characters include likenesses to Jesse Faden, Rose Marigold, and Shawn Ashmore / Sheriff TImothy Breaker.\n\n\nThe Alan Wake 2 Expansion Pass  —  included in the digital deluxe edition — covers the Night Springs DLC. However, if you're looking to pick it up separately, Night Springs runs $20. If you're ordering the new physical deluxe or collector's editions of Alan Wake 2, those also include the expansion content.\n\n\nTomorrow's big updates also include a free Photo Mode, taking inspiration from Alan's wife, a professional photographer, and adding settings like f-stop, focal length, and other effects you'd find in similar, dedicated modes. But this is Remedy, so of course, I've got loftier expectations for how I want my Alan Wake 2 photography to shape up. \n\n\n(Story Developing)\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 Night Springs DLC launches tomorrow, along with physical edition pre-orders appeared first on Destructoid.",

That remake is Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, but fans weren't excited about their favorite game being completely remade from the ground up.

Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. \nIn Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an \"open-ended world structure\" as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). \n\n\n\"Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat,\" a press release for Possessor(s) reads. \"Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses.\"\nThroughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. \nHere are some Possessor(s) screenshots: \n\nPossessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine's other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year. \nWhat do you think of this Possessor(s) reveal?

Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of Tenjutsu (48h version), which Deepnight released back in 2022.\nDevolver describes the game as a \"fast and fluid rogue-jutsu,\" leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza \"hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City.\" To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them \"you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence.\" \nCheck out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWhile you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. \nHere are some Tenjutsu screenshots: \nThere is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC. \nWhat do you think of Tenjutsu's reveal?

As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car.

After a teaser trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, we finally have our first look at gameplay. Plus, the studio announced Slitterhead launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.\nRevealed in a new trailer during the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Slitterhead's debut gameplay trailer starts in a Chinese city, with a police detective searching through a trashed ally. He finds what appears to be a mangled body in a trash can before the trailer shows more of the neon-lit Chinese metropolis, with shots of (presumably) our playable protagonist jumping from high above to the ground below while using some spectral power that allows them to possess bodies of pedestrians. We also get a look at Slitterhead's monstrous creatures and third-person survival action gameplay, which features both guns and melee combat. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Slitterhead gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Slitterhead is looking quite action-packed, especially compared to Toyama's Silent Hill efforts. However, the lineage is clear. \nSlitterhead has largely remained a mystery since its reveal. We know in 2021, Toyama said he was working on a choice-driven game, and we assume that's Slitterhead. Toyama also told IGN Japan his next project (presumably Slitterhead) would be released in 2023. Obviously, that didn't happen, but now we know it's releasing this November. Outside of that, a behind-the-scenes video diary showed a few clips of Slitterhead, including training room-esque encounters, a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nSlitterhead hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8. \nWhat do you think about this first look at Slitterhead's gameplay?

Public officials have been abducted, including Batman associates Commissioner Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent.

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.\nRight now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:\nMega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge\nMega Man II\nMega Man III\nMega Man IV\nMega Man V\n\n\nFor those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware. \nYou can stay updated on the Nintendo Switch Online’s retro offerings by visiting our complete database of available games.",

Revealed during today's Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. \nIn the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. \"Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.\" It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. \nCheck out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:\n\n\nIn Arena, players find \"Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma's Colisseum. Here, Morgan's clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.\" Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.\nIn the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. \nHere are some Kiborg screenshots: \n\nArena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game's preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. \nThat same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will \"expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates\" for all players at no additional cost. \nHere's a look at the Concord box art: \nAlongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. \nHere's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: \n\"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,\" the blog post reads. \"That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.\" \nThat beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. \nFor more, watch the Concord reveal here. \nHow do you feel about Concord's price point?

The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.\nRed and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. \nA press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. \nWhile we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here.

And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. \n\n\nTo celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an \"Extra Battle\" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. \n\"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,\" a press release reads. \"Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use.

          "description": "The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it's adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. \n“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”\nEven though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be \"quite big\" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.\nHBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” \nFor those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.\n[Source: Deadline]",
