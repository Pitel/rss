Speaking about what Pikmin means to him, Miyamoto confessed that he considers the adorable plant species to be \"Nintendo's most global characters\" and he wants players to have a real sense that the creatures could exist in the everyday world:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Regardless of whether you are a 'dog person' or a 'cat person' (team Nintendo Life seems to be an even 50/50 split), there is no denying a pup's goodness. Regardless of the dog's training, obedience or, indeed, sex, we dog-loving humans throw out the phrase \"what a good boy\" at near enough every pooch we meet.

          "description": "It's a kinda magic.\nThe Might and Magic series is about as ‘old-school RPG’ as it gets—it’s been around since the distant, ancient days of the 1980s. As the series has changed hands a couple of times over the decades, plenty of spin-offs have been generated, with Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes being the one Nintendo fans are likely most aware of. As part of the then-new Ubisoft continuity, this DS project aimed to broaden the fanbase by going with an action puzzler gameplay design that would be generally more approachable and fit comfortably on the humble hardware. Now, a decade on, it has been revived as Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes – Definitive Edition by none other than developer and publisher Dotemu, of Streets of Rage 4 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge fame. Though not much has changed here since its introduction, this Definitive Edition nonetheless shows that this was always a solid and enjoyable puzzler that stands as a welcome addition to the Switch library.\nMight & Magic: Clash of Heroes is set in the magical world of Ashan, taking place in the Ubisoft timeline a few decades before Heroes of Might and Magic V. The story kicks off with you playing as Anwen, a young elf girl who is quickly orphaned when a sudden demon attack plunges her camp into chaos. The demons are after a mythical artifact called the Blade of Binding (no, not that one) which could open a portal to the demon realm and kick off a full-scale war in Ashan if the demons got their hands on it. Thirsty for revenge and desperate to avert the impending conflict, Anwen sets out on a fraught race against time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You could play through the original Pikmin in a swift couple of hours, and even Pikmin 3 didn't pack the longest playtime out there, but we specifically mentioned the \"hefty 30+ hour running time\" in our review, and we were not alone.\nThis makes it all the more impressive that in Nintendo's recent Ask the Developer interview series, Pikmin 4's director, Yuji Kando, confessed to having played through the main story mode \"around 20 times\" in order to iron out any bugs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Take Pikmin, for example: yes, it's hardly the most obvious example since we received Hey! Pikmin in 2017, but it's been over a decade since Pikmin 3 launched on the Wii U. Despite the ongoing rumours and hints regarding what would eventually become Pikmin 4, many of us had simply accepted that maybe, just maybe, the mainline franchise would remain indefinitely dormant\nThankfully, this wasn't the case, and Pikmin 4 is just about ready for its grand debut on the Switch. It's not alone either. For a good while, it was feared that even Metroid would become lost to the Nintendo archives, but with the successful launch of both Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime Remastered on the Switch, you could argue that the franchise has never been healthier.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Its 2004 sequel, Pikmin 2, removed the somewhat divisive time mechanic from its predecessor and added a bunch of dungeons, improving the core experience and giving players a meatier, if somewhat more relaxed experience to dig into.

Now the team have cleared up the situation and are “abandoning” their efforts completely.\r\n\n\r\n“First things first - Nintendo did not send Valve or Dolphin a [DMCA Takedown] notice against our Steam page,” the team clarified in a recent blog post, before adding that “Nintendo has not taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve.” \r\n\n\r\nWhat actually happened was a legal back and forth. Valve’s legal department had contacted Nintendo regarding the emulator’s Steam release. A lawyer representing Nintendo asked Valve to prevent it. And then Valve forwarded that statement to the Dolphin team, “and told us that we had to come to an agreement with Nintendo in order to release it on Steam.”\r\n \nRead more",

I held out hope it would improve, though, as lots of commenters assured me it's fun side would finally surface. \"Just play several more hours and things really open up! Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!\". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.\nBut the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.\nRead more",

          "description": "Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes was one of those Nintendo DS games that I never played at the time but had always heard was very good. Its unusual triple-decker sandwich of strategic, match-three RPG puzzling hasn't really been replicated in the fifteen-odd years since it first came out, unless you count its own HD remaster that came out in 2011. Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love. Because it really is very hard, and I still can't quite decide if I'm having fun or not.\nRead more",

Then again, given the mild horror themes in many of the levels and the general terror the excellent enemy design invokes, you probably shouldn’t be playing it around kids in the first place. As a fan of this sequel’s predecessor, Remnant: From The Ashes, I had my hopes set unreasonably high, and not only has Remnant II completely met my expectations, but it also kept messing around with what I thought I should be expecting. It left me in a constant state of awe. This is a furiously ambitious follow-up and has everything I could have ever wanted.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lisa: The Painful has been described to me as Undertale before Undertale. Or Earthbound after Earthbound (so, uh, Mother 3?). In other words, Lisa was a bit of a cult classic thanks to its freaky world, absurd humour, and brutal consequences. And when I say brutal consequences, I mean your party members can permanently lose limbs or turn into mounds of saggy flesh. How’s that for a debuff? Its Definitive Edition is out now, though, so maybe its \"cult\" status will finally blossom into mainstream appeal. Lisa: Definitive Edition bundles in the original game and its expansion, Lisa The Joyful, as well as new enemies, bosses, stories and endings, and an easier “Painless” mode. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Turns out there’s plenty more, as port developers Nixxes Software have used a  Sony blog post to detail quite a few new tech toys – including Rift Apart’s Microsoft DirectStorage 1.2 support.\nDirectStorage is simultaneously one of the most exciting recent developments in gaming hardware, and one of the most underutilised: it basically adapts your PC’s process for reading data from an SSD or hard drive in a way that can massively reduce game loading times, but has so far only made it to prime time in Forspoken. I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?\nRead more",

          "description": "I never thought I'd hear the words 'roguelite' and 'Minesweeper' together in the same sentence but here we are. Let's! Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. \nYou see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.\nRead more",

I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.\nA big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst.

These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. \nFull Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.\nRead more",

That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance. \nRead more",

All that for £175 - not bad, right? \nTo get this price, you'll need to sign up for Dell's newsletter to get a 5% off code, then use it with another code - TELEGRAPH5MON - at the checkout. That brings this £259 monitor down to £175, complete with a three-year warranty and free delivery. \nRead more",

Which may be why I don't quite know how I feel about Decarnation.\nThere's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common \"what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for\".\nProtagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.\nRead more",

As with its ancestors, you're invading a fictional country with a team of dysfunctional freelance mercenaries, managing their equipment and clashing personalities through a guerrilla war on an open world map whose every sector can host turn-based battles.\nIt challenges the all-smothering XCOM standard of \"two actions per turn\" by restoring the ancient way of the Action Point. Everyone has a dozen or so action points per turn to split between movement, shooting, or miscellaneous contextual actions. Chance to hit is never listed, but accuracy can be bumped by spending extra action points. It innovates too by giving everyone a small pool of free movement, keeping battles moving, and broadening the tactical possibilities. It borrows as much from modern designs and is mostly better for it.\nRead more",

I had a sneak peak at its freshly released Steam demo back in March at GDC, and I came away impressed by both its abstract visuals and fluid, dance-like scraps with its angular enemies. The demo is only 30 minutes or so, so why not give it a go for yourself?\nRead more",

Své schopnosti využíval k pronikání do národních telefonních a mobilních sítí a k poškozování vládních, podnikových a univerzitních počítačových systémů. Vyšetřovatelé ho v té době označili za nejhledanějšího počítačového hackera na světě.",

Meanwhile with Ampere Altra Max and AmpereOne there is no SMT and it's likely Intel's upcoming Sierra Forest will also lack SMT (Hyper Threading) given it's an E-core-only design. But that led to my curiosity over the SMT impact for Bergamo on power and performance when leveraging SMT for the 128-core flagship EPYC 9754. Today's Bergamo benchmarking is looking at SMT on and off for both 1P and 2P server configurations.",

It’s Fruitbus, and it’s here to fill the massive, truck-sized hole in my heart.\nI really need this after the colossal disappointment that was Food Truck Simulator. I’m still not over that. Fruitbus is generally a similar concept, except all your food is vegan, and you serve it to animals. You get to explore an open world in the eponymous food service vehicle and gather ingredients to feed to all the folks.\nhttps://youtu.be/YOK-vXFoDOs\nThe trailer shows off a wide variety of activities, customization, and faces to stuff with food. Listen, this is going to sound really weird, but seeing that you have to pull the parking brake is really exciting to me. It’s the small touches that connect you to a game’s world, and you should never count out the mundane tactile tasks as an effective way to draw you in.\nThat’s about all the information we have here. I mean, really, they had me at parking brake. I don’t want to get my hopes up too much about Fruitbus. However, it looks like it ticks a lot of my extremely specific boxes. I was really excited for Food Truck Simulator, but it failed to deliver. Hopefully, what it really needed was some smoothies and the hungry faces of crowds of furries.\nUnfortunately, I’ll be waiting until 2024 to play Fruitbus. It’s coming to PC and “consoles.”\nThe post Fruitbus is a food truck sim that I need right now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been making tracks\nKonami has announced that their 2020 game, Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban, has passed 4 million units sold. What’s important about that? Well, a few things.\nMomotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban has never been released outside of Japan. That’s not entirely surprising, as Momotaro Dentetsu is a long-running series that started back on the Famicom back in 1988. Back then, it was produced by Hudson Soft, but after Hudson went bust, all its assets were bought out by Konami in 2012. However, in all that time, Momotaro Dentetsu has never been localized. Not one game. It has always stayed in Japan.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392615\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Konami[/caption]\nFurthermore, 4 million sales in Japan is a crazy number. To put this into perspective, Famitsu reported last month that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has a lifetime sales number of 2,208,705. It’s not quite the numbers of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (5,211,237) or Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (5,328,989) and not even close to touching Animal Crossing New Horizons (7,477,507). Still, for a non-first-party Switch exclusive, it’s a rather insane number.\nSo, does this mean we’ll see it over here? Failing that, will the West get the upcoming Momotaro Dentetsu World: Chikyuu wa Kibou de Mawatteru!? It’s not impossible, but I wouldn’t exactly count on it. The Momotaro Dentetsu games are steeped in Japanese culture. They’re in the style of board games, and are largely about traveling Japan’s legendary rail system to buy up as much of it as possible. It’s sort of like Monopoly but for public transportation.\nThe point is, I found this very fascinating, and if you’re reading this paragraph, chances are you’ve fallen victim to my eclectic enthusiasm. You’re welcome or I’m sorry. Take your pick.\nThe post 2020’s Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban has sold over 4 million in Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Why do people still do this??\nIt's unfortunate that the gaming industry is rife with abuse and harassment. Whether it's workplace discrimination or hate speech online, there's no shortage of stories when it comes to toxicity. Sadly, indie developers are not immune to this either, as the project lead for the upcoming fan project Skyblivion says they've recently been receiving death threats.\nIn a post on Twitter, @Rebelzize says that working on the unofficial Oblivion remake has meant \"dealing with stalking, death threads [sic], harassment,\" as well as hacking. An additional tweet goes on to say that the team has \"already sacrificed so much\" and that the project lead is working a full-time job while having to deal with this. At the time of writing, it's unclear why they've been the target of online abuse.\nhttps://twitter.com/Rebelzize/status/1680929214944378880\nAs well as harassment and stalking, some \"bits and bobs\" were lost when the developer's Discord server was hacked. Fortunately, the server and \"all other accounts\" are now back, and it seems as though the upcoming project is still on target for a 2025 release.\nWhat is Skyblivion?\nFor those who don't know, Skyblivion is an unofficial remake of the fourth Elder Scrolls game that's being rebuilt in Skyrim's engine. It's been in the pipeline for several years now, but recent updates from the team show that progress is coming along nicely, and it's looking pretty fabulous so far. The remake is said to be free, but you'll need legitimate copies of Oblivion and Skyrim (duh), as well as the expansion packs.\nIt's frustrating to see that people are still being subjected to online abuse, whether it's the players themselves or studios. There's no clear reason why @Rebelzize would be receiving death threats, but there are plenty of others who are cheering the project on, with the \"good [outweighing] the bad 1,000 to 1.\"\nThe post Elder Scrolls ‘Skyblivion’ fan project dev says they’ve received death threats appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let’s watch, shall we?\nhttps://youtu.be/Vs2piSWfofQ\nWas that really super quiet to you? I had to crank all my volume levers to actually make out what the grim, passionless voice was saying.\nIn any case, I suppose robots fighting a big tank is a type of story. I’m not sure what it tells me about the overarching narrative of Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. I suppose it conveys all the important information: big robots, skate jets, lots of guns. Then there was a person under a tarp, with a big robot creepily watching them.\nWhile I got my start with Armored Core on PS1, I fell off the series with Armored Core 4 on PS3. I played that game a long time ago, but I vividly remember getting screamed at constantly for leaving the combat area. It’s not like there were laser walls or some kind of marker to inform me where the combat area was. I’d just strafe off to the side, and suddenly someone was threatening to cut all my systems.\nStill, I'm interested in playing Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon to make up for the fact that I haven’t played the series since. Hopefully, no one shouts at me in this one. Or, at the very least, I hope someone puts up a sign to tell me where the combat area ends.\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is out on August 25, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Take a peek at Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon’s narrative in this new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The grime from Joel's POV\nIt may have been a huge, bug-ridden let-down when The Last of Us Part 1 released on PC, but a series of patches is aiming to fix the biggest problems. And it's not just Naughty Dog that's tinkering with the remake, either. One modder has been looking to implement a first-person mode for the game, and a recent video shows off this work-in-progress.\nVisual artist and YouTuber Bryan Ortiz (aka Voyagers Revenge) has uploaded some footage from their first-person modification of The Last of Us Part I on PC. Specifically, the video shows the \"brutal combat and new aggressive gameplay.\" Over the course of nearly nine minutes, you'll get to see the crumbled world of Part I from the perspective of Joel, as he fights off both the infected and attacking gangs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFhTdX-3Hvc\nWhen will we get to play it?\nUnfortunately, this mod is not currently available, and is still being worked on by Ortiz. In response to a comment that asked whether this first-person mode will become available, Voyagers Revenge says it's currently unstable. It's also been built for an early version of the game, and is \"crashing the game multiple times.\" However, they did say they'll \"pull some strings soon,\" so it's possible they may look to releasing the mod at some point.\nWhen it came out earlier this year, the PC version of the Last of Us remake was panned due to a laundry list of technical issues. It was a shame, really, as for many PC users, it was the first time they'd had a chance to check out Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed game. However, the updates must be doing the trick, as recent scores on Steam show that Part I is now sitting at \"Very Positive,\" though still \"Mixed\" overall.\nThe post Fan-made The Last of Us Part I First Person Mode video shows off ‘brutal combat’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

They've marketed this one more than any other entry before it, and they're not done yet! Hot off of the My Nintendo shop is a new product: shoe charms. This is in addition to the prior sticker reward.\nNintendo usually provides some stats or info for My Nintendo drops, but not this time! The shoe charms are pretty much as advertised: it's a trio of charms that you can put on footwear to stand out, and the set comes in a baggie with three characters (Red, Yellow, and Blue Pikmin). The charms themselves are rubber and have a small latch on the back. They're a bit like Croc's Jibbitz charms. It'll cost you 500 Platinum Points for the privilege, plus shipping. I got them for my daughter!\nThe other reward is a kitchen towel set for 600 Platinum Points. This one has some info: \"Add a touch of Pikmin decor to your home with this microfiber kitchen towel! Decorated with a pattern of Red Pikmin, Blue Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, and Ice Pikmin along with touches of greenery, this absorbent towel makes for an easy and fun way to carry off minor spills.\" It's 24\" x 18\" and is made of microfiber.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"392683,392684\"]\nNeed Platinum Points?\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "Also, let Capcom know your thoughts on the game\nWhether we like it or love it, the video game industry is in something of a remake enlightenment of some kind. There are, of course, some fantastic remakes and remasters out there, one of which is Resident Evil 4. Not only a great game in its own right but a fantastic reimagining of what many consider to be one of the best horror titles in existence.\nSince the remake was released in March of this year, Capcom's modern take on RE4 has been a rousing success. In fact, according to the developer, the game has now surpassed five million in sales. The press release on the company website says the Resident Evil 4 remake \"provides both fans of the series and newcomers alike with a fresh gameplay experience.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/Id2EaldBaWw\nThis latest milestone comes just shortly after it was announced that the game had sold four million units. To date, the Resident Evil series has sold around 142 million copies worldwide, going back to its first entry in 1996.\nWhat's next?\nResident Evil 4 may be the latest in a list of remakes Capcom is doing, but is it the last? In June, the studio asked what RE fans wanted to see next, and whether anyone was interested in even more remakes. On top of that, a recent shareholder meeting suggested the developer was not necessarily saying no to remaking spin-off Resident Evil games. Then again, they weren't saying yes either, so it's still up in the air.\nOf course, we can't say for certain what's in store. We're pretty confident in saying that RE9 is probably imminent (though we don't have full confirmation on that yet), and it's possible that Capcom may want to do more reimaginings in the future. A lot of fans would probably like to see an official remake of Code Veronica, for example.\nIn the meantime, you can let the developer know what you thought of Resident Evil 4 by taking this questionnaire.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 remake tops five million in sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

Remnant: From the Ashes had a rather modest launch back in 2019, but in the years following acquired somewhat of a cult following. I loved the original, but definitely felt it had room for improvement. Thankfully, Remnant 2 improves on what made Remnant so much fun, while also fixing some of the more glaring flaws.\nOh yeah, and also like the original, Remnant 2 is hard.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392524\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nRemnant 2 (PC [reviewed], PS5, Xbox Series X|S)\n\nAfter creating a characte…",

They've seen the memes, the fanart, and the fanfare from all sorts of creations; with the trend arguably popping off with Solaire of Astora, aka the \"Praise the Sun Guy.\" Well, Elden Ring added a ton of characters to the pile, including the Turtle Pope.\nYep, toy and statue purveyor Youtooz has an officially licensed plushy on the way of a fan-favorite NPC. Youtooz notes that this particular release is 9 inches tall, and is modeled after Miriel, Pastor of Vows, also known as \"the Turtle Pope\" from Elden Ring. It's priced at $29.99, and it'll ship sometime within a window of September 9 through October 9 (for the US and Canada only).\nHere's the full product description:\n\"Miriel, Pastor of Vows arrives at Youtooz to give us all their blessings! At 9 inches tall his large green and brown shell protects the soft, yet incredibly sturdy, scaled brown body that emerges from its safety! His legs and head extend outward with a gentle smile as a white mitre sits atop their head, its gold embellishments shining as brightly as the Erdtee’s light! This plush is packed to the seams with 100% PP cotton and is made of normal minky, sublimated minky and shiny materials, absolutely perfect for cuddling or teaching you the wildest sorceries and incantations!\"\n\nWhile I'm holding off on getting a Turtle Pope of my own, if my daughter was old enough to play Elden Ring and liked it, I couldn't resist.

This completes its growth into a full version that began back in October, 2022.\nQuriocity places you in the role of a leader of a space colony. Humans have developed faster-than-light travel, and it’s time to put roots down on new planets. More than just advancing and building up your space empire, you need to ensure that your colonists are comfortable this far out from humanity’s cradle. Beyond that, new settlers will be arriving on your space paradise, and you’ll need to be ready to accommodate them.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZKFXhdivf64\nThe update that is coming with Quriocity’s release is a hefty one. It includes 5 new maps, seasonal and dynamic weather, and 48 unique campaigns. Considering the complaint that I often see leveled at Quriocity’s current state is a lack of content, this will probably be enough to satisfy that hunger. The developers state that this patch is the result of community feedback.\nI’ve bounced off a fair few space city builders over the years. I’m not sure I have the time to jump into Quriocity right away, but I’ll have it earmarked to check in the future. I always find that games of this very particular sub-genre have a certain sterility to them. I’m sort of seeing that same problem here, but with the addition of foliage and dynamic weather, it might break the mold.\nQuriocity is currently available via Steam Early Access, with the full version dropping on July 25, 2023.\nThe post Full release of space colony builder Quriocity lands July 25th appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is the game that Destructoid’s own Chris “MARCO!” Carter said was “possibly my favorite From Software game yet.” High praise from our Player 1. I think the sale price is worth it just to check out the hunky Blaidd the Half Wolf.\nI’ve got bad news for you, though. None of the Metal Slug games are on sale. Not one.

          "description": "Will it ever happen?\nOlder gamers will recall legendary developer John Romero's immortal words when he was promoting his new game (new for 2000, at least) Daikatana. Sadly (or perhaps not), no one was made to feel like the Doom co-creators \"bitch,\" and his first release after leaving id Software proved to be a flop.\nWas it the worst game launch in history? It's probably up there, but it's largely been clouded by much more contemporary titles like No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/15303b5/john_romero_ama_featuring_doom_guy_life_in_first/\nHowever, according to a recent Reddit AMA, Romero would quite happily see Daikatana make a return at some point. In response to a question about the aged FPS, he said he would \"support a remake.\" Replying to a similar question further down, Romero adds that, if it were to be remade, Daikatana \"could be an exciting game, [more so] than the original.\"\nA Daikatana remake is just a pipe dream, so far\nThis doesn't mean a remake or reboot is on the horizon, as far as we know. Plus, Romero did specify that he wouldn't be involved in such a project, though he would possibly be onboard as a consultant of some kind. We already know that he's working on a new FPS with a major publisher, which he restates in the Reddit thread. Pretty much nothing is known about this project, and the man himself even says he can't say anything about it.\nJohn Romero is something of an icon in the video game industry. While he's been making games since the early 80s, it was 1993's Doom that helped set the scene for the early days of the first-person shooter. These days, he is still active in the gaming world, even making some new maps for Doom. As such, it'll be interesting to see what he's currently working on, and whether Daikatana will ever get a second chance.\nThe post John Romero is not opposed to a Daikatana remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Palia gameplay first look shows off fishing, hunting, gardening, and more\nThe term \"social MMO\" is always a scary one for me. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea. But in practicality, many games have tried but none have quite succeeded in creating a fun social MMO. I've been following Palia since it got announced a couple of years ago. The developer, Singularity 6, is made up of industry veterans from companies like Blizzard, Riot, Zynga, and Sony. With that sort of track record, it seems like this team is well-set to pull off their goal.\nEarlier today Singularity 6 gave the world an official first look at the gameplay in Palia. And while I certainly still have some questions, I can at least say I'm excited to move into Kilima Village and explore the world of Palia.\n[caption id=\"attachment…",

It was a stellar combination of virtual and tabletop mechanics in a gorgeous, distant space setting that drew me in and quickly became a favorite. So when Citizen Sleeper 2 appeared out of the blue, you can imagine how eager I was to hear more about it.\nThe first game follows a rogue, copied consciousness on the run, trying to avoid the hunters of their corporate overlords while attending to a steadily deteriorating body. It's a battle against planned obsolescence, in a cold station on the fringes of space. A place where a \"Sleeper\" like you could find a home, or at least a crossroads towards a new one.

Gunbrella comes to us from Doinksoft, who last developed Gato Roboto (if you don’t count Devolver Bootleg). That was the first game I reviewed for Destructoid, back when I was just a shy-but-plucky freelancer bugging Chris “Maximum Ups” Carter for a chance at the big time. For my first time, I did such an adequate job that I was allowed to do it again. Now here I am.\nI didn’t love Gato Roboto. I didn’t hate it, either, it just didn’t really have enough substance to it. In that review, I said, “It’s hard to recommend Gato Roboto when we live in a world where games like Cave Story and Iconoclasts exist.” Doinksoft must have taken that to heart (if they read it at all) because Gunbrella has many more shades of Cave …",

To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. \nDespite the \"VI\" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or \"Raven\" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. \n\n\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.\nThe five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.\n\n\nThe video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. \nAtlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. \nEnjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nUbisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. \nIn our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. \nFor more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. \nThe Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.\nAre you excited for The Crew Motorfest?

Its announcement was one of the biggest surprises of Summer Game Fest, and after getting to go hands-on with it during SGF’s Play Days event, we came away excited about the blue blur’s latest adventure. \nNow, Sega has released the game's opening animation. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Sonic Superstars features a Sonic CD-esque opening, with its bright blue skies and emerald green plains. After dashing through some enemies, Sonic joins his buddy Tails before teaming up with the rest of the Sonic Superstars playable cast, Knuckles and Amy. Together, the four prepare to take Eggman on before speeding toward the screen. \nThe trailer ends with the news that if you preorder the game, you’ll receive an “exclusive Lego Eggman in-game character skin, acrylic display stand, and reversible cover.” This preorder bonus will go great with the other Lego Sonic Superstars skins coming to the game as DLC. \nSega has yet to reveal a release date for Sonic Superstars but it’s due out sometime this fall on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\nWhile waiting to learn more, read about how Microsoft, at one point, considered acquiring Sega, and then read about why we think Sonic’s latest outing, Sonic Origins Plus, is two steps forward and one step back. \nAre you picking up Sonic Superstars on day one?

As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. \n\n\nHere’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: \nFor the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. \nThese songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.\nStray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023. \nWill you check out Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical next month?

          "description": "The Clock Tower series is a favorite among horror game aficionados, but the first game has never been released outside of Japan. That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.\nFor any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).\nThe actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. \n\n\nWayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. \nClock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.",

Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. \nEnjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nIn 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a \"rising tides raise all ships\" scenario. \nAfter playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. \nRa Ra Boom hits PC early next year.\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024. \nAre you going to check out Ra Ra Boom later this year?

The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. \nThe game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  \n\n\nBanishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.",

The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. \nSecret Base says the beat 'em up features \"seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves.\" Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27.

Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. \nBack in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. \nOur statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS\nJuly 11, 2023\nIt's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is \"ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report,\" likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). \nGame Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. \nWhat do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard?

          "description": "Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. \nTuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. \nCheck out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:\n\n\nTuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.\n“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” \n\nLet Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. \nTuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”",

          "description": "EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.\nEA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.\nEA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.\nWe'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!",

          "description": "EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.\nThe upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”\nCliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. \n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.\nBlack Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones. \nTo keep up with other upcoming superhero games, we've made a list of them for you to check out here.",

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. \nMost of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nCheck it out for yourself: \n\n\nAs you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: \nIn 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year.

In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. \nCheck these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm,\" a press release reads. \"The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery.\" \nElsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. \n\nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023. \nFor more about the game, watch Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 New Gameplay Today and then read our preview thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it.",

And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!",
