Taiji is another one that we'd bundle into this group, a 2D open-world puzzler that arrives on the eShop on 25th February.\nThe game's solo developer, Matthew VanDevander, was very open about its Witness inspiration when it launched on Steam back in 2022, and we can see why. This is a game where you explore a mysterious world, solving a series of grid-based puzzles as you go. Taiji switches The Witness' first-person perspective to a top-down, 2D pixel art, but the answers-hidden-in-plain-sight approach is all still present and correct.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game's creator Venris on YouTube. He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around \"eight to 12 hours a day\", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as \"Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon\". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.\nRead more",

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are \"disappointing someone\". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.\nYou may or may not find all that \"soothing\" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look \"a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman\", which I would translate to \"my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here\".

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an \"I'm Spartacus\"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.\nBefore that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed \"psychogeographic RPG\" from newly formed Longdue.

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Rabbit & Bear Studios, the folks behind Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, just laid out one of their own with dates for three upcoming story expansions.\n\n\nPlayers won't have to wait too long for the updates, each focusing on one of three main characters. It all starts on February 27 with The Chapter of Marisa, a Marisa-centric expansion that spins a yarn about the character's encounter with an enchanted girl. What happens when the pair set out to dig through the secrets of the \"Child of the Rune,\" and what sinister forces are at work behind the scenes?\n\n\nAfter that, we have The Chapter of Seign to look forward to on March 13, tasking Seign with handling an issue within the Galdean empire. The Chapter of Markus closes things out on April 3, as Markus, Carrie, and Nowa investigate the strange realm beyond a newly unlocked teleportation gateway.\n\n\nImage via 505 Games\n\n\nAll three chapters will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. If you fancy continuing your adventure over the next few months, the story expansions will be priced at $7.99 each.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that, according to the latest Kickstarter update, these scenarios are the last parts of the game that Suikoden and Eiyuden Chronicles creator Yoshitaka Murayama worked on directly. The industry veteran passed away on February 6, 2024, after dealing with \"complications with an ongoing illness.\" Maruyama was very enthusiastic about the project, so it will no doubt be worth seeing how his final pieces of input shaped the DLC to come. \n\nThe post Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes sets dates for trio of story expansions appeared first on Destructoid.",

That said, the performance you might get could fall way below your expectations if the game's director, Carrie Patel, is to be believed.\n\n\nAvowed will finally run at 60 fps at launch on Xbox Series X\n\n\nTalking on the MinnMax podcast, Patel said players can play the game on 60fps.\n\n\n\n\"You can get up to 60[fps]\"\n\n\n\n\nThis news will be huge for those who will be playing on the Xbox Series X. Last time, Obsidian made it clear that Avowed will only run at 30fps at launch on the Xbox Series X. This news did disappoint some, as the Series X is the beefier console (compared to Series S).\n\n\n\n\nBack then, the devs claimed that the game had become \"a lot juicier\" in development. This was cited as the main reason behind the limitation on frames per second. Something has definitely changed since, and players will be able to access higher fps, but there's a catch.\n\n\n\n\"You gotta accept a little jank to do something fun and creative, I think.\"\n\n\n\n\nHence, it's safe to assume that running the game at 60fps might be possible, but it might feel unoptimized. That said, it's still better that Series X users will at least have the feature to try and enjoy Avowed with higher fps. Any optimization issues are likely going to be sorted by Obsidian post-launch.\n\n\nThe upcoming title will be released on February 18 after a long delay (it was originally scheduled to launch towards the end of 2024). If you choose to purchase the Premium Edition, you can start your journey on February 13. The game will also be available from day one on the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.\n\nThe post Avowed can run at 60fps at launch on Xbox Series X but developers say expect some “jank” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Most 5-star characters in Genshin Impact are limited, meaning they’re only obtainable during specific event banners. However, a select few are relegated to the standard pool, giving players a chance to pull the character even when they’re not featured. Is Yumemizuki Mizuki fated to be limited or standard?\n\n\nMizuki will be a standard 5-star character\n\n\nHoYoverse confirmed during a version preview that Yumemizuki Mizuki will be added to the standard 5-star character pool. This means her upcoming banner in the first half of Version 5.4 will likely be the only dedicated event banner for Mizuki. After her banner comes to an end, you’ll have a small chance to obtain her on other limited character banners, on the standard banner, or on Chronicled Wish banners.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDoes this mean Mizuki will be bad?\n\n\nThose who were around during the Dehya debacle might be anxious at this news. Standard 5-star characters range from fairly decent (Tighnari, Jean) to outright terrible (Dehya, Qiqi). Being added to the standard pool is a portent of mediocrity. Dehya, the most recent character to make her way to the standard banner, is notorious for being particularly weak.\n\n\nMizuki will likely never reach the power level of Mavuika or Neuvillette, but she doesn’t seem to be bad either. From what we’ve seen so far, Mizuki will have a unique kit, be easy to build, and work with many teammates. If you like Mizuki and want to play a Swirl DPS, then Mizuki will be a perfectly fine pull.\n\n\nThat being said, unless you really like Mizuki, I recommend holding off on her limited event banner. Save your precious Primogems for a character you love, and you might accidentally get Mizuki along the way. Emphasis on “might.” It took me more than two years of playing Genshin Impact to get my first Mona.\n\nThe post Is Yumemizuki Mizuki coming to the standard banner in Genshin Impact? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The outcome of most quests in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will decide how the story evolves, and you'll want to pay strong attention to the points of no return.\n\n\nThe points of no return represent certain stages in the main campaign from where you won't be able to backtrack. In simpler words, any side quests left incomplete till this stage will remain as such, so you must finish them before reaching the stages.\n\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 points of no return explained\n\n\nThe two points of no return are decided by the regions available in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The first point of no return is available in the Trosky region. It's tied with the Necessary Evil quest, which is part of the main storyline.\n\n\nBefore you begin this quest, make sure to complete every side mission available in the Trosky region. Of course, you don't need to complete all of them, but any you leave out will remain like that. Not only will you miss out on the completion rewards, but a part of the lore will also remain out of your access on that particular save.\n\n\nImage via Deep Silver\n\n\nThe second point of no return is part of the Kuttenburg region, and it appears before you start the Oratores quest. Like Necessary Evil, Oratores is part of the main questline as well. Similar to the previous one, you must finish all side quests available at the Kuttenburg region. Any that you leave unfinished will remain so in your playthrough.\n\n\nIf you're focusing entirely on the main campaign, you'll be able to complete the game quicker. However, you'll be losing out on a lot of fun, as the lore really kicks strong after the first few quests. You'll also progress slower as completing the side missions will help you to gain more in-game experience and other valuable resources like Groschen.\n\nThe post All points of no return in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The nice thing about Kuroku's Basket Showdown is that there aren't many styles to choose from. With only four styles currently available, it's pretty easy to get familiar with all of them and pick the one that works for you. That's the other nice thing: No matter which style you get from the gacha, you can always play around it and be a valuable asset to your team.\n\n\nUnfortunately, even though you can learn how to play using each style, some of them are just overall better than others, hence the gacha and the rarity system. Knowing this, here's our Tier list of all Styles in Kuroku's Basket Showdown.\n\n\nKuroku's Basket Showdown Tier List\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAs we said in the beginning, no matter which style you use, you can always be useful to the team as long as you take full adv…",

          "description": "Kuroku's Basket Showdown has a very fun style system, which gives you a few more options during matches. Depending on which style you use, you can get higher jumps, better passes, and even special moves that guarantee shots. Before you know which Styles you should aim for, you need to know what they do. Thus, we've prepared a list of all of them. Here are all the Styles in Kuroku's Basket Showdown.\n\n\nKuroku's Basket Showdown All Styles\n\n\nThere are currently four styles in Kuroku's Basket Showdown. Two rare, one epic, and one legendary. You've guessed it: to get the epic and the legendary one, you'll need to play the gacha. Thankfully, you can earn money to buy gacha spins just by playing the game, and there is even a pity system in place. Here's what each style has:\n\n\nStyle name\nAbilities\n\n\n\nKuroku (Rare)\nMisdirection: Become invulnerable and dash sideways (even through opponent players).\nVanish Drive: Same as Misdirection but you dash forward.\n\n\n\nTepei (Rare)\nHook Shot: Shoot a ball at the hoop from the side. Great if you get cornered by opponents.\nAuto Pass: Aim at a teammate and pass them the ball without fail. Super useful.\n\n\n\nAomino (Epic)\nFormless Shot: Aim at the hoop, and activate an automatic shot that's unblockable while airborne\nBack Spin: Dash forward and Ankle Break any opponent that tries to steal your ball. Similar to Vanish Drive but more powerful.\nAwakening Move: Dribble through other players as you move at a high speed. You stun anyone you pass throught.\n\n\n\nKagame (Legendary)\nJump: Guess what you do here? Jump super high and block/intercept almost any airborne ball.\nDunk: Slam-dunk a ball while in range. Boomshakalaka! \nAwakening Move: Perform an unblockable dunk if another player passes you the ball while you are near the opponent's hoop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all other is to it. If you need a boost in Kuroku's Basket Showdown, check out our Kuroku's Basket Showdown codes.\n\nThe post All Styles Kuroku’s Basket Showdown appeared first on Destructoid.",

Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
