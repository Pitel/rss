The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.\nRead more",

Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work.

I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far.

Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound. \r\n \nRead more",

Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.\nThe simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens.

It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.\nStriking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you're getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.\n \nRead more",

It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka \"Swery\" Suehiro (then again, what is their \"norm\"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.\n\"In the future,\" said Swery, \"I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet).\"\nRead more",

One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe.

The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.\nSchim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.\nRead more",

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server.

Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?\nRead more",

          "description": "Every now and then, something might go wrong in Roblox. For example, server outages can cause certain aspects of the game to not function properly. Other times, Roblox might even be tagging everything you say, so why is that?\n\n\nWhy is Roblox tagging everything I’m saying? \n\n\nIf you’re wondering why Roblox is tagging everything you say into the chat, it can be for three reasons:\n\n\nServer issues\n\n\nIn July of 2024, there was a “partial server disruption” that caused everything said in the game’s chat to be filtered. This means that whatever you type into the game will appear as tags. For example, if you say hello to someone, all you’d see is “#####”.\n\n\nMany players would see this and think that maybe they’re being hacked or their accounts are being monitored for bad activity. Rest assured, that isn’t the case. \n\n\nAlways check the game’s server status to see if there are any problems regarding server hiccups should these persist.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nChat restrictions\n\n\nIf the servers are all good and everything is fine, but you’re still getting this, it might actually be a you thing. If you are typing expletives, offensive or harassing words, or other sensitive material into chat, your messages are going to be filtered out. \n\n\nTry sending a normal message like hello or something normal to see if you’re still being restricted in chat. Otherwise, it might be an age restriction thing.\n\n\nAge restrictions\n\n\nIf you have an account and your age is set to 13 or younger, most chat will be filtered out with tags. This is just to prevent most if not all, potentially inappropriate things and sensitive info from being sent out or seen. \n\n\nIf your account is above the age of 13, more things can be sent and seen, though there will still be some restrictions.\n\nThe post Why is Roblox tagging everything you say?

While you could go through four years of university and extra if you pursue graduate programs, the Golden Diploma gives you an easy way to obtain a degree instantly.\n\n\nWhere to get the Golden Diploma in BitLife\n\n\nBitLife's Golden Diploma is a premium item in the game's marketplace. Its full price is $13.99, with the price dropping during sales. You can access the store by heading into the main menu, selecting BitLife Marketplace, and scrolling down to items until you find the Golden Diploma. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMuch like the Golden Pacifier, the Golden Diploma isn't available as a free item you can unlock through achievements or challenges. If you want to experience it yourself, the marketplace is the only legitimate place to get it.\n\n\nWhat does the Golden Diploma do in BitLife?\n\n\nAfter purchasing the Golden Diploma, you can use it to get a degree for any character who's graduated from secondary school.

You can choose up to two degrees, including those from Law and Medical school.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSince you obtain the degree instantly after selecting it, you won't have to wait four to eight years to complete your course. In other words, you can enter the medical field and get a high-paying job as a family physician, psychologist, or brain surgeon immediately after finishing high school, compared to waiting nearly ten years.

          "description": "Etherlight and Oatmello have their game Dreamsweeper releasing in two days on July 24, 2024. It’s a strange mix of dungeon crawler roguelite and the classic game of murky origins, Minesweeper.\n\n\nIt’s not often that you see Minesweeper bleed into other games. The classic of early Windows computers had you searching a field of blocks while trying to – counter to its name – avoid mines. Your only way of locating the mines is by numerical hints that appear beside cleared blocks that let you know how many mines border on a given square.\n\n\n\n\nI used to be really good at it back when I was younger. I feel a lot of people old enough had a phase where they had it mastered.\n\n\nDreamsweeper lifts the mine-avoidant gameplay and applies it to a dungeon crawler. Each step you take brings with it risks, and a cleared block will show the number of bordering threats. Tussles with enemies is depicted as a rhythm game. You can purchase accessories that will alter the way the game plays.\n\n\nSpeaking of rhythm, Dreamsweeper sports a lo-fi soundtrack, which is supposed to relax you while you advance through procedurally generated dungeons with nothing but arithmetic to help you avoid disaster.\n\n\nDreamsweeper releases on PC July 24, 2022. A Switch version is planned for sometime later.\n\nThe post Dust off your Minesweeper skills for Dreamsweeper appeared first on Destructoid.",

That is to say, you have two characters that you, as a singular player, control at the same time. Like if Adventures of Lolo had you playing as both Lolo and Lala at once.\n\n\nInspired by games like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Crater Song is built with the NES in mind, with a physical cartridge version in the works. If you’re on digital (say NES) controllers, you turn them sideways, using a d-pad for each character. If you don’t mind that I keep coming at you with obscure references, it’s like how the NES version of Smash T.V. handled its dual-stick gameplay.\n\n\n\n\nWhile much of its gameplay shows off avoiding enemies to step on buttons (and sing, apparently), there are also sections of third-person quasi-3D travel that are similar to 3D Worldrunner.\n\n\nCrater Song is set on the same world as Orebody: Binder’s Tale. You play as the twins, Arco and Menuett, who are cursed to attract cosmic horrors, which reminds me of my dating life. It came out in March of this year, but, as part of the physical announcement, they have released a “Definitive Edition” update.\n\n\nIt seems neat. I actually own the NES cartridge version of Orebody: Binder’s Tale, and for some reason, I still haven’t played it. Mostly, I just love the era we’re living in when it comes to homebrew games. Even legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage, Beyond Oasis), is working on a new game for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Old hardware rules. Modernity sucks. Yes, I’m old.\n\n\nCrater Song is out on itch.io. The physical version will be through Premium Edition Games with preorders going up sometime in the near future.\n\nThe post Crater Song is a new game for NES featuring singleplayer co-op appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The hype for Baldur’s Gate 3’s seventh major patch continues to rise, especially with highlights revealing the introduction of new endings, official modding support, and over 1,000 bug fixes across multiple core areas. However, while Larian Studios initially planned to release this patch's Closed Beta on July 22, they've since announced a delay caused by passive dice roll bugs.\n\n\nIn Larian Studios’ latest announcement regarding BG3’s Patch 7 Closed Beta testing, the team revealed that a bug causing passive dice rolls to stop working led to a brief delay in the beta’s release. While no exact revised date was revealed in the announcement, it mentions it’ll launch “later this week”, suggesting that this is a brief delay as they quickly resolve the issue.\n\n\nFortunately, this delay doesn’t seem to impact Patch 7’s release date, as the announcement still mentions September as the public launch time.\n\n\nLarian Studios first mentioned Baldur’s Gate 3’s seventh patch in an April Community Update, where they detailed some of the bug fixes we can expect from this major update. Since then, each one, particularly the latest Community Update 28 Closed Beta announcement, continued revealing more details about it, with features like split screen mode, evil endings, and the official modding toolkit among the massive list of upcoming improvements.\n\n\nAs of now, Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 7 Closed Beta will still be available sometime between July 23 and 27, with no exact time or date currently known. You can sign up for the beta by visiting the game's Steam store page and requesting access to its playtest. \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 7 Closed Beta delayed following dice roll mishaps appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're still actively playing, you're probably familiar with Awakened Raids and their special currency, Bronze Bullions. If you've been hoarding these, I have the perfect place for you to blow some dosh and get some sweet cosmetics.\n\n\nHow to get Bullions (even if you haven't played in a while)\n\n\nBronze Bullions started dropping a while ago as a part of the \"grand finale\" of Dragonflight. One raid per week became \"Awakened,\" offering higher-tier loot and one Bullion per week. If you missed weeks, don't fret - all missed Bullions are added to your drop pool. You can easily get a whole heaping of Bullions just by killing some Awakened 'Looking For Raid' bosses. Doing so will give a chance for a Bullion (it's pretty high, probably 30-40% in my experience) until every possible catch-up drop is exhausted. \n\n\nSee Mirioszin in the Parting Glass for Jigglesworth Sr. and transmog\n\n\nOnce you've got a few Bullions, head over to the Parting Glass and see Mirioszin, who's cheekily hidden away behind all the gear vendors:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it's the end of the expansion, you certainly don't need to be spending a bunch of Bullions on gear, so why don't we get something that will carry over to War Within?

While most of these are easy to source, some may leave you wondering. \n\n\nOne of the five different quest lines featured as part of Wachumeqimeqi Deliveries is through Xeerol Ja, who requests your help to expand the menu of their juice business. This is the quest line which can be completed using either Culinarian or Alchemist, so it’s definitely a good one to do if you’re working your way towards grinding out Orange Crafters’ Scrips. \n\n\nThe second recipe you’ll be asked to make in this quest line in Cherimoya Juice. One of the ingredients, as you’ve likely surmised, is Cherimoya, but it’s not immediately clear how to get it. \n\n\nHow to get Cherimoya in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCherimoya doesn’t appear in the Gathering Log, regardless of the levels of your Gathering classes, because it cannot be gathered. It also cannot be crafted. In that case, your first instinct is likely to be to head to the Marketboard, but as with any ‘rare’ item, the prices there are less than favorable. \n\n\nDon’t part with your Gil too quickly - getting Cherimoya is actually remarkably easy, because it’s sold by a specific vendor in Tuliyollal. It’s not too expensive, and you can buy as many as you like without having to meet any requirements. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nGoplu, located in Bayside Bevy Marketplace at (X:13.1, Y:12.7), sells a variety of items including Grade 8 Dark Matter, Gysahl Greens, and Fishing bait, but they're also the only vendor in FFXIV who sells Cherimoya.\n\n\nAt 986 Gil each, Cherimoya isn’t the cheapest of ingredients, but you only need six of them in order to complete the recipes for Xeerol Ja.

That's why it's crucial to keep track of the game's event schedules, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member. To stay updated, here's the current Pokémon Go Community Day schedule for July 2024.\n\n\nWhen is the next Community Day in Pokémon Go?\n\n\nAccording to the official Pokémon Go page, the next Community Day will be Aug. 31. The featured Pokémon for this event has yet to be revealed. However, some theories have speculated a Popplio-centered launch. Since the other two Sun and Moon starters, Litten and Rowlet, have previously celebrated a Community Day in 2024, it would make sense for Popplio to be the next one up. \n\n\nNo matter what Pokémon gets the spotlight, you can always expect a Shiny variant for this creature. They'll also spawn more frequently in the wilds to give you better chances. \n\n\nBesides the wild counters, trainers can unlock a special attack for the featured Pokémon. We've seen this with Tynamo's latest Community Day, providing a Fast Attack Volt Switch for its evolution. \n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\nA Special Research Story will likely be available before the event. This story unlocks an exclusive mission for the Community Day Pokémon but at the cost of one dollar. Additionally, event bonuses can be earned during the event, including a reduced Stardust cost for trades, Lure Modules extension, and double candy rewards. \n\n\nIt should be noted that Community Days are often limited in time. Generally, these celebrations last for three hours, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time. They also tend to debut on Saturdays or Sundays, so make sure to clear your schedule for the weekend. \n\nThe post Pokémon Go Community Day schedule (July 2024) appeared first on Destructoid.",

During my visit to BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out the game's expansive character creator, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.\nThough BioWare released a big look at Veilguard's prologue via a 20-minute gameplay trailer last month, they haven't released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara. I learned a lot about this character, and knowing I was one of the first outside of the stud…",

However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. \n\n\nSeason 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.\nMultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC.

It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.",

Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.\nPulls ♾️\n@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS\nJuly 22, 2024\nFor the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word \"cyber\" in its name.\nIt's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.\nThe Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.\nhow do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game?

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. \nA cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. \n\n\nHeihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.\nFor more on Tekken 8, check out our review.",

The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. \n“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”\nAfter years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. \nFor our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode.

The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

          "description": "Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \n\n\nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.",

Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.\nFallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations.

          "description": "Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",

Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.\nFor those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. \nAlthough it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:\nPress the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.\nNavigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.\nChoose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds\nSelect the background art you want using the A button.\nYou can read more about the impending Xbox 360 store closure and final updates by visiting this Xbox Wire article.",

          "description": "Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. \nTomb Raider Chapter\nLara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:\nFinesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.\nHardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.\nSpecialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.\n\n\n2v8 Mode\nOn July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. \n\n\nCross-Progression\nCross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. \nToday’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry).

This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. \nDeveloped by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.\n\n\nWe still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. \nThe Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. \nA Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. \n\n\nAs previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. \nTMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. \nAlthough Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. \nTakeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  \n\n\nTakeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review as well as the trailers for previous DLC fighters Homelander, Omni-Man, Ermac, Peacemaker, and Quan-Chi.",

This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. \nThough there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. \nCharizard\n\nGengar\n\nSnorlax\n\nJigglypuff\n\nSole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read about an upcoming Nike x Tekken 8 shoe collaboration.\n[Source: Sole Retriever]\nAre you interested in picking up any of these Crocs?

Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts \"exploding knife!\" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess.

It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating.

That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. \nGhost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…",

Dubbed \"Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist,\" these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. \nThe shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. \nCheck out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. \nSole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. \nThese Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September.
