          "description": "It's more than zero.\nWe don't blame you if you’re intimidated by Falcom’s The Legend of Heroes: Trails series. This massive saga is now up to its twelfth mainline game in Japan, with the West falling behind at an alarming rate. However, one piece of the puzzle has been missing for years – Crossbell. After years of begging, fans are finally getting these “missing” games, starting with The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero. And, it turns out, there’s a reason people have been desperate to see these games get an official English localisation – Trails from Zero makes a pretty strong case for being one of the best entries in the entire series.\nAs with every Trails game, there’s always a caveat when trying to get into the series: Where do you start? The Switch, in particular, doesn’t make this easy, with only Trails of Cold Steel III and IV available on the platform in the West. But Trails from Zero is nowhere near as impenetrable as these future entries, with a plot and cast of characters that feel pretty self-contained. Of course, some characters from the Trails in the Sky games (which are currently only on PSP or PC here) make an appearance, references to past events slip in, and one primary plot thread is resolved from the Liberl arc, so it’s hard to deny that Trails from Zero is at its most rewarding if you’ve played Sky. But it’s much more accessible than the other two Switch offerings in the series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not only has that game and its sequel—Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden—come out since then, but we’ve now received yet another sequel in Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden. As you’d probably expect, this newest entry is largely cut from the same cloth as its predecessors, but with some meaningful nips and tucks here and there that help to give it its own personality.\nThe Beasts of Burden follows the story of a girl named Al’e (by default, you can name her whatever you want) who dreams of one day seeing the stars. Al’e lives in an underground village beset by frequent monster attacks, which are slowly chipping away at their limited supplies and remaining residents. Al’e is quite the capable warrior, but while she’s out fending off yet another monster swarm, another group of monsters manages to sneak into the village and kill everyone there. Grieving the loss of her mother and friends, Al’e is then whisked to the surface by a mysterious boy who seems to want to help. Here, she learns that she holds a special power that allows her to control monsters to do her bidding. Armed with this newfound ability and aided by her new ally, Al’e sets out on a quest for revenge against the ones behind the incident that destroyed her home.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…\nRead more",

I'm still not sure if he's talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog.

Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.\nIndeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time. \nRead more",

Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant.

How the turn tables have turned.\nI'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies.

          "description": "Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. \nIt doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping. \nRead more",

We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you'll be pulling as heroine Frey \"I'm seeing freaking dragons\" Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won't be mega cringe. Alas, we weren't privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you're playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.\nAnd I wasn't being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game's mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it's going to be a real hit when it lands.\nRead more",

          "description": "Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. \"Let me in!!\" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. \"I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!\"\nIf you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.\nRead more",

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about. \nRead more",

It's often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, \"You havin' a laugh, mate?\" and \"Facking hell!\" - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik' tha', innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she's often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. \nIt's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something. \nRead more",

          "description": "Bridget Be Ballin'\nFighting game modders will never cease to amaze us with their talent and ingenuity, always creating lavish costumes, fun crossovers, and other creative concepts for some of the community's most beloved games and characters — Submitted for your approval: This fantastic \"Basketball Bridget\" mod for Arc System Works' slick anime fighter Guilty Gear Strive.\nThe new look, meticulously crafted by modder manmadee, sees the happy-go-lucky scrapper trade in her nun-like hoodie and trademark Bullet Yo-Yo for some sweet gym sweats, fingerless gloves, and a meaty B-Ball. She looks adorable as all hell, and is set to take the court by storm, and I pity any luckless opponent who is getting set to take Bridget's basketball straight to the face... I mean, it's happened to us all at least once, right?\nCheck out this video from GAMETV. (And keep an eye out for a cameo by the Mod King at 1:10)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJCoDzxH4s\nBY THE BUCKET!\nManmadee's mod comes with several color variants, which include options for eyeglasses, cat ears, and an instantly recognizable purple-and-yellow ensemble, as worn by NBA team L.A. Lakers. Because of the yo-yo's propensity to return to Bridget's hand, it makes her basketball attacks simultaneously believable and also hilariously physics-defying — but that's all part of the fun. I think she looks fantastic, and the new gear is a great way to celebrate her highly publicized arrival to the GG Strive roster.\nYou can pick up Basketball Bridget, alongside manmadee's other great mods, over at GameBanana.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. It is coming to Xbox in spring 2023.\nThe post White Girls Can’t Air Dash: An awesome Basketball Bridget mod for Guilty Gear Strive appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Switch is also 720p\nSonic Frontiers framerate variations have been revealed, according to an attendee who spoke to Sega at TGS this past weekend.\nSonic Frontiers framerate breakdown:\nBased on the report, it seems like the PS5, PS4, and Switch editions will have the following options:\nPS5: 4K visuals with 30 FPS - or HD visuals with 60 FPS\nPS4: HD visuals with 30 FPS\nSwitch: 720p with 30 FPS\nNo information could be discerned about the Xbox editions (or PC), however, it would make perfect sense for the Xbox Series X/S to line up with the PS5 settings, with the Xbox One edition lining up with the PS4. Sega has also clarified, according to the report, that the Switch version will sport 720p30 visuals docked and in portable mode. All versions also have \"variable\" framerates, so performance may change, especially given that it's an open world game.\nIn 2022, a \"performance and visual mode\" toggle for a AAA game on a current platform is expected, as is 720p and 30 FPS for a third party Switch game. All of this lines up with what anyone could have guessed on paper, but now we'll have to see if it actually plays out this way in practice. I'm a bit worried about the PC port in particular.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers framerate will be 60 FPS on PS5 in HD mode, 30 FPS on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Does he have an anti-nausea superpower too?\nIn theory, getting a first-person view as Spider-Man swinging around New York sounds like the coolest thing ever, because who doesn't want to be Spidey? In practice, though, it's a bit of a nightmare — I can't even look at the screen for more than a few seconds without being overcome with nausea. But if you can stomach the herky-jerky camera, and if you're just dying to play Spider-Man in first-person, this new mod has you covered.\nSpider-Man's release for PC means that modding the game just got a whole lot easier, hence why the aptly named \"Spider-Man PC First Person Mod Web Swinging\" mod by well-known GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 modder Jedijosh920 has gained some attention online. They also released a slightly less stomach-churning video where the camera stays fixed in place as Spidey spins and flips around, so that's at least a little bit better.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylHkF4ExBE\nMind you, I used to be a roller coaster junkie, but unfortunately as I've gotten older, my motion sickness has only gotten worse and worse. When I came across the video showcasing the mod on Twitter, I had to scroll away pretty fast at risk of ending up like Liza Minnelli in Arrested Development. \nEven so, I have to admit that this is something I'd like to experience, motion sickness permitting — although it's pretty sad to be hit in the face with the reality that I wouldn't be able to handle life as a web-slinging superhero simply because I get sick by moving around too much. Oh well, I was never made for the crime-fighting life anyway.\nEither way, it's always fun to see modders put a new spin on some of our favorite games, and to the brave souls out there who are somehow playing this in VR, I commend you.

The Switch port is expected to arrive before the end of the year, although a specific release date was not announced.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lwnDx4qnAo\nXiaomei and the Flame Dragon's Fist, (originally titled Fire Dragon Fist Master Xiao-Mei), is an ultra-retro scrapper inspired by the first scrolling brawler of all time, Irem's 1984 coin-op Kung Fu Master. Operating on a simple 2D plane, the player guides the beautiful young martial arts specialist as she battles her way through a relentless throng of bandits, monsters, and crazed animals on a mission to save her sister Xiaoyin from the evil influence of the mysterious Dark Dragon.\nThe Nintendo Switch port, which launched in Japan back in May, features some tweaks and improvements from the original PC release. These include an alternate mode featuring Xiaoyin herself; brand new cutscenes — ably voiced by popular idol unit Suika; improved FM sound effects; a gallery mode; and a remixed soundtrack, composed by Sega veteran Hirofumi Murasaki, (of Shinobi III and Dragon Force fame). So if you're yet to experience the simple-but-frantic action of Xiaomei's world, then this incoming localization will offer the best experience yet.\nXiaomei and the Dragon's Fist will launch in the west on Nintendo Switch later this year.\nThe post Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon’s Fist is headed west on Switch this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Decks keep rolling out\nValve has once again beaten its estimates for Steam Deck reservations. Today, the company confirms it has sent all reservations for the Q3 window.\nThe Q3 bucket, ranging from July to September, is slightly ahead of pace and so Valve is already getting a head-start on Q4. The store's already been updated with a new description, as it extends from September on through December.\nThe Deck manufacturer announced in July that it has been fulfilling demand sooner than estimated for the portable PC. As such, Valve started bumping reservations up further in the queue.\nNow, it looks like those Q4 reservations are starting to roll out. So that's a PSA, for those of you waiting on Steam Deck tickets, to get your wallets ready.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvokyBOYe8Y\nMore on deck\nThat's not the only Steam Deck news from the last few days, either. The official dock for the Steam Deck was on display at last week's Tokyo Game Show 2022, as shared around on sites like Reddit.\nWhile some third-party solutions have been around, Valve's official dock has been delayed. I've since picked up a powered USB hub for my own purposes, and it does a decent amount of what any dock would do. But the ability to prop up and park the Deck in it, like a Switch dock, is a big part of the appeal.\nNo target window has been set for the release of the Steam Deck dock. \"We're working on improving the situation and will share more info when we have it,\" reads the official statement from the time.\nStill, while the dock is backed up, the Steam Deck seems to be flying off the production line. Those who are in line for one should hopefully not be waiting too much longer to get their reservation email.\nThe post Valve is getting a head start on Steam Deck Q4 reservations appeared first on Destructoid.",

A leak of early footage of Diablo IV has been making the rounds, showing off more of the RPG in action.\nSpotted by sites like PC Gamer, a Reddit user linked some footage from a filesharing site which seems to have footage from a private test build of Diablo IV.\nWe've looked at the footage to verify its existence and yes, it sure does look like Diablo. Alongside the giant watermarks plastered across the video, it's got shops, towns, and placeholders.\nWe reached out to Blizzard for confirmation of the footage's validity and comment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdDpqCmjb4\nNumbers go up\nIt was a notable weekend for leaks, as a massive pile of Grand Theft Auto VI footage also found its way online.

Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations.

If you wanted some Octopath Traveler 2 footage following the recent Nintendo Direct reveal, you got it! Square Enix just gave us 20 minutes of it thanks to a TGS stream. Don't worry though! Although the stream was done for TGS, there's a full live English translation baked in as audio commentary.\nKicking off at roughly 25:00 in the below video, we get a full 20-minute walkthrough of the game, and some of the aesthetic and design changes in the sequel. One big element that the team showcases is elevation, which brings \"height and depth\" to the maps. There's a bit of variation involved with the game's designs, with footage of a forest village and an \"old west-like town.\"\nBased on this Octopath Traveler 2 footage, natural time progression is in, too, and there will be \"drastically different music\" in some day/night cycles, including tracks that sound unique compared to the original. The team wanted to ensure that there wasn't a sense of repetition between playing the original and the sequel, and it gave them a good excuse to \"explore different genres\" of music to boot. The developers mused on how much of an undertaking it was, having to design day/night music for all of the locations in the game, only a portion of which were shown off via a brief look at the world map (31:00 in).\nIdeally, Octopath Traveler 2 will address some of the common complaints of the original (including how things homogenize after the individual character stories are completed): because so far, they're still nailing the aesthetic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XuTb462yCg&t\nThe post Square Enix just gave us 20 minutes of Octopath Traveler 2 footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

The 2020 adventure title is currently back in development at CyberConnect2, and is preparing to wow fans in 2023 with an impressive new rerelease on current-gen console platforms.\nThe new versions of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot — which is already available on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Stadia, and Nintendo Switch — will sport improved textures as well as boosted light, shadow, and water effects. A short comparison clip, which you can check out below, depicts the open-world adventure running on modern hardware, and it has to be said it is quite an attractive upgrade, given that the original version is already an authentic adaptation of the legendary anime franchise.\nhttps://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1570761217618108416?s=20&t=tUNx-l32ofCdOGVmpgfJFA\nIn addition to the new ports, Bandai Namco also revealed a new DLC story expansion, that will focus on the arrival of Son Goku's father, Bardock. The Bardock: Alone Against Fate DLC will be a loose retelling of the events depicted in the 1990 OVA Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku. The story expansion will cover events such as Bardock's time as part of Frieza Force, and the arrival of his legendary son. The new DLC is the first of three story expansions, which should keep Kakarot fans engaged for the coming year, at the very least.\nDragon Ball Z: Kakarot for PS5 and Xbox Series X and the Bardock: Alone Against Fate DLC will launch together in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlWhBkAO0M\nThe post Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot looks delightful on PS5 and Xbox Series X appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "See more than others ever have\nDeveloper Sorath blasted onto the scene in 2016 with the first-person arcade shooter Devil Daggers. Now, the studio is back with another bizarre shooter, with possibly even more mind-bending action in Hyper Demon.\nHyper Demon launches today on PC via Steam, for $14.99. As the tag advertises, it's about slaying demons in a world like no other. And, apparently, from a view like no other either.\nThe faster you slay demons in Hyper Demon, the harder the game gets. But your score also ramps higher and higher. There is, apparently, an end. The question is, can you make it there?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScglDSi9KUs\nMuch like Devil Daggers, Hyper Demon has minimal controls. Collecting gems will allow players to buff up their capabilities, or charge up and execute massive super moves.\nThe trippy effect you see on the screen is what developer Sorath describes as \"groundbreaking spherical projection,\" which gives the player a wide peripheral view without pinching or shrinking the center of the screen. It is truly something to see in motion. And it allows for fields of view stretching out to 180 degrees.\nAlongside that, the game also has a holographic rear view overlay. So basically, you can have complete 360-degree awareness, if you can learn to visually parse all the chaos happening on the field.\nThe devil inside\nDevil Daggers was definitely a memorable experience from 2016. It had a dark and intense vibe, taking the general concept of being a devil who shoots magic daggers from their fingers into an arena shooter frenzy.\nIts visuals were particularly wild, so it's cool to see Hyper Demon continue to push this into almost surreal places. With a surprise launch too, this is a nice Monday morning surprise for folks who love visually unique arena shooters.\nHyper Demon is out now for PC on Steam.\nThe post Hyper Demon is Devil Daggers creator’s trippy new FPS, out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The last time we heard about this port was roughly three years ago\nThree years ago, Xbox boss Phil Spencer gave us hope that Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox was a distinct possibility. But it's still in limbo. I even reached out to Microsoft and Square Enix in 2020 to see if any movement had been made, and was given a \"no comment\" response from both parties.\nYet, Japanese site Game Watch spoke to Spencer at TGS 2022, who gave a brief comment on the situation. The short of it? There's still no major progress on Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox, but talks aren't completely dead yet. Here's what he had to say:\n\"We certainly announced that (laughs). Naturally, we haven’t given up yet. This is a commitment from both Microsoft and Square Enix to gamers and we will continue to coordinate our efforts.\"\n\nIt's not much to go on, to be sure! But at the same time, it's comforting that Spencer, in 2022, isn't willing to throw in the towel yet. Back in 2020, Final Fantasy XIV producer Naoki \"Yoshi P\" Yoshida noted that it would take a lot of resources to make that happen, so perhaps the wheels are still being greased: \"we have to think about long-term planning with additional platforms, we need additional testing for that particular platform. So it kind of exponentially grows the amount of resources that needs to be allocated.\"\nThere's also the consideration of Microsoft and Sony working in tandem, given that they need to cooperate for the game to function cross-platform. Currently, Final Fantasy XIV is available on PC, PS4, and PS5. With the move to the Xbox platform, with full cross-play and cross-progression intact (this is something Square Enix has been hardline on), it would be an even more formidable MMO force to be reckoned with, with a bigger audience.\nThe post Phil Spencer once again muses on the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

Despite being as famous (and infamous) as most folks in the industry will ever get, you're not likely to see a new on-camera interview with Minecraft's Notch or FEZ's Phil Fish anytime soon. Putting your personal struggles on display isn't for everyone.\nSuda51 has no such misgivings about showing the human side of the creative process. In fact, the very first game company he worked for was called HUMAN, and as he explains in this inaugural chapter of a tell-all interview series, it was Suda's soft and heartfelt love of games and pro wrestling that landed him the job. That combination of excitement and fear was key to his subsequent success. As he tells it, those feelings also led to a fair amount of vomit in his mouth.\nhttps://youtu.be/FW0bOm_fYDw\nThis same mix of thrills, chills, and stomach-turning spills are part of most of his games, from early titles like soon to be rereleased action-and-horror titles like Lollipop Chainsaw, Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, and No More Heroes 3. What you make comes from who you are, even if that means tasting a little of your own puke now and again.\nThis new \"Creator's File\" interview series also marks a rebrand for Grasshopper and Suda51's new YouTube channel. It will feature other members of the company as well, as they talk about their history and experiences in the industry. It's a perfect holdover for fans of the studio as they wait for the announcement of new Grasshopper projects. I've gotten a little of the inside scoop on one of their unannounced titles and it's definitely going to be a big hit with fans of Suda's scriptwriting style.\nKeep an eye peeled in the video and you may actually see a hint of what they're working on.\nThe post Suda51’s details his eye-opening career in this new YouTube series appeared first on Destructoid.",

While he had the mic, he took the opportunity to explain why Final Fantasy XVI wasn't at the show: \"I haven’t gotten a chance to talk to the marketing or public relations teams at all, so I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say, but I think we’ll probably be able to release the next trailer next month or so… And after that, I hope to be able to give a rough idea of when it will be released.\"\nWe could get the Final Fantasy XVI release date in October\nYoshida is famously known for not wanting to show things unless there's more concrete info to actually showcase, which is counter to how Square Enix infamously reveals a lot of their projects. The two big takeaways from this statement from Yoshida not only hint at an October trailer release/an event of some sort, but a potential release date.\nAt the moment, we do have a window though!

As reported by Eurogamer, the tabletop edition of the mega-selling 2022 release will launch a preliminary crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter \"soon.\"\nWhile there are very little in the way of images or details pertaining to the adaptation, Steamforged Games has revealed that Elden Ring will see one to four Tarnished players embark on a whole new adventure in The Lands Between, visiting familiar locations and locking steel with a rogues' gallery of recognizable and formidable opponents. The board game will feature \"characteristically challenging\" dice-free combat, relying on strategy and adaptation in order to survive the encounter.\n\n\"Elden Ring is a stunning, genre-defining video game, and we are humbled and privileged to be bringing it to your tabletops. To say our team is passionate about the game would be an understatement,\" says Steamforged CCO Mat Hart in a press release. \"Our mission is always to deliver authentic tabletop adaptations that capture the essence of what fans know and love about the IP. Fans should expect a dark, richly-realised tabletop world of mystery and peril, with satisfying combat and rewarding exploration. Prepare to lose hours to this game, and to be glad about it.\"\nThis is not, obviously, Steamforged's first rodeo in the world of tabletop video game adaptations. Previously, the company has developed board and card games based on popular franchises such as Dark Souls, Monster Hunter World, Resident Evil, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Pac-Man, and Devil May Cry. We will be sure to give you a heads-up right here on Destructoid when the Elden Ring campaign goes live.\nFor more information on the new game's format, check out the official Steamforged Games website.\nThe post Elden Ring board game campaign is coming to Kickstarter appeared first on Destructoid.",

Our hero, \"Chap,\" must negotiate a series of garden mazes, gathering a total of 61 keys to unlock what must be the biggest door in human history and free his gal from her floral prison.\nYou can check out the action in the trailer below, courtesy of YouTuber crazyclimber80.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhXW4HJoNbg\nBeing chased by dinosaurs, wolves, jellied blobs, a cigarette-smoking... thing, and even a cute, unkillable lady vampire named Tsukaima, Chap's only defense is the ability to push walls to block or crush his opponents (though defeated enemies will return after a short period of downtime). After battling his way through each maze, Chap will come face to face with his lady's captor, the mad scientist Gurerin. Like a lot of maze-chaser titles, short intermission sequences features cute cartoon cutscenes starring the game's characters.\nRompers would not receive a home port, but did feature in several Namco compilations and was made available on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan. This new release represents one of the very few occasions in which the title has been made officially available outside of Japan.\nRompers is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Save the girl and ruin a garden in Arcade Archives’ Rompers appeared first on Destructoid.",

PowerWash Simulator can be played as a stress-free cleaning sim, or players can choose to add a variety of challenges — such as time limits and finite resources — in order to up the antiseptic ante.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoGFZlt4Egw\nPlayers can customize the look of their equipment, and each switch out tools and attachments to deal with those particularly stubborn stains. Don't want to wash alone, then invite along a buddy for some relaxing co-op cleaning action. PowerWash Simulator might have one of gaming's simplest premises, but it is one that has seemingly resonated with thousands of players, with the title becoming a popular wind-down title for those looking to relax at the end of a hard day or to while away the wee hours of the weekend.\nAfter all, why waste time cleaning your real home when you can just clean a pretend one?\nPowerWash Simulator releases \"soon\" on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. It is available now on PC and Xbox.\nThe post PowerWash Simulator will be blasting onto PlayStation and Switch soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

I had some consoles when I was younger, like a PS2, a Game Boy Advance SP, a Nintendo DS, and a Wii, but pretty much all of the games I played were “girly” horse-related, Barbie, or licensed Disney Channel spin-off games.\nI had a great time with those games (which have merit in their own right), but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed in retrospect that I missed out on some of the all-time greats. The good news is, now I’m an adult with my own time and money, and I’m fortunate enough to have a job centered around games — which means I can …",

Self-described as \"potentially the hottest bird lawyering game to come out of 1840s France,\" Aviary Attorney is clearly a very Ace Attorney-flavored game, which we all know as iconic and tons of fun. There are three possible endings, all \"drastically different,\" casting a new light on the main characters as they discover what justice means.\n\nAfter our first stream last Friday, I can confirm Aviary Attorney is very witty and comical.\nI like that the cases have details that matter, lines where you may need to remember some very early clues, and a (sometimes frustrating) time limit to find them; so it's a fun challenge to remember everything and put the clues to use. The characters are full of personality with unique dialogue and I'm really enjoying it.\nDrop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.\nThe post We’re streaming Aviary Attorney tonight appeared first on Destructoid.",

While a packed January and February are now in the cards, we got some insight all the way up through May, with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Now this handy Nintendo infographic provides a full picture of what's to come with 2022 Switch games into 2023.\nThe updated infographic comes straight from Nintendo's Twitter account, which leads off with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, then very smoothly leads with first-party games. We have Pikmin 4 finally confirmed for 2023, as well as a new Fire Emblem and a Kirby remaster. The recently-released Splatoon 3 and the Xenoblade Chronicles 3/Mario Kart 8 Deluxe season passes are included too. In the near future for first-party 2022 Switch games, Bayonetta 3 and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope are arriving in October, with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet ending the year in November with what will certainly be a big splash, sales-wise.\nThird parties aren't left out either, as several Switch ports are given time to shine (like It Takes Two, Sifu, and Tunic), mixed in with remakes like Front Mission 1st and Front Mission 2. You can check everything out in the image below, or watch the Direct for yourself. Or check out our recap!\n2023 is gearing up to be a triumphant return for many studios following copious amounts of delays; but folks who partake in multiple platforms have a ton left to look forward to, even as the year comes to a close.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1570819809796919296\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ9Iz7HhU-I\nThe post Nintendo reminds us of all the games coming to Switch in 2022 and beyond appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Current gen titles to sport top-tier prices\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that the publisher is to adopt a $70 USD price tag for all of its major releases going forward. The new price point, which is fast becoming industry standard, will be applicable to all of the publisher's \"AAA\" titles.\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Axios, Guillemot noted that the price change was in-line with other publishers in the industry that have also decided to add a further $10 to the Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of their biggest releases, particularly for current platforms such as PS5 and Xbox Series X. The first Ubisoft title to release at the new price will be the current-gen edition of Skull & Bones — scheduled to launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X in November. Future releases such as the upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage are also expected to adopt the new pricing scheme.\nWhile many will understandably groan at the inevitable price hike, Ubisoft is by far the first publisher to take this step, and is in fact one of the few outliers in this particular situation. 2K Games' NBA 2K20 was the first title to launch at $70 back in 2020. Other publishers, such as Activision, Sony, and Square Enix, would follow suit — putting out premium titles such as Returnal and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, even on the traditionally \"cheaper\" PC platform. Future blockbuster releases, such as the PS5 edition of God of War Ragnarok, are also expected to retail at the new price point.\nUbisoft Yves Guillemot interview [Axios]\nThe post Ubisoft will be adopting a $70 price tag model for its major releases appeared first on Destructoid.",

Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game.

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu's life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. \nIn the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. \nCheck it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nAs you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023. \nFor more, read about today's Like A Dragon 8 reveal and then check out this story about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a 2014 Yakuza spin-off finally coming to the West next year.",

That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nAs you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. \nLike A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. \nIn the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.",

          "description": "Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!",

The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun.

However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. \n\n\nAs the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. \n“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”\nFae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.",

This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.\nUp to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system.

Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.\"\n\n \nPikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. \nPikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and \"very close to completion.\" Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that \"it is progressing,\" seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!\n\nNintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out! \nAre you excited for Pikmin 4?

All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure.

CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. \nDuring the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. \n\n\n\"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,\" Nowakowski said during the call. \"Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future.\" \nAs for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. \nIn the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow should CDPR further develop its Cyberpunk IP?

While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. \nWe already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that \"Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.\" \nIn 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn't, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, \"In terms of pricing, we've been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.\" Today's Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.\nUbisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It's worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin's Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.\nYou can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft's troubled workplace culture, the company's current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint's integration of them, and plenty more here.",
