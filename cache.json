Yes, it's been featured in listings here and there, but now in the latest update it's been given an official reveal via social media.\nAs you see it shows the famous duo, a new character called Snoutlet and a little bit of the world Mario and Luigi are about to explore, known as Concordia. An empty background similar to Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey also returns.

First released on PS2, Xbox, and GameCube at the end of 2003, Beyond Good & Evil was one of the most unique adventure games of its day, showcasing a world that Nintendo itself would have been proud to call its own.\nThis 20th Anniversary Edition remaster updates the experience with revamped visuals, improved performance (sort of), quality-of-life upgrades, and more. But is it still as enjoyable now as it was two decades ago? Well, the answer is thankfully a resounding “yes”: Ubisoft’s re-release is easily the best way to experience Jade and Pey’j’s epic journey on Nintendo hardware, but it’s also not without a few niggling issues.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Starting life as an RTS in SteamWorld Tower Defense, Image & Form’s long-running anthology series has been to space, the Wild West and it’s even taken on the form of a fairy tale. And while Dig, the Metroidvania-style series, is arguably the most popular, many have a soft spot for the 2015 3DS hit SteamWorld Heist.\nReturning to the strategy-esque roots of the franchise, SteamWorld Heist is a side-on turn-based strategy game that takes the unique aesthetic and humour of the SteamWorld series and combines it with gunslinging, bullet-ricocheting action. We loved it, and Ultimate Edition on Switch is a no-brainer. Even so, we weren’t expecting to see Heist return, but nine years later, SteamWorld Heist II is almost here. We got a chance to go hands-on with the PC version of the game at Summer Game Fest, and we can already tell this is a well-oiled machine that fans will love, and newcomers can jump straight into, too.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Atari’s once ubiquitous overhead racing classic is now making a comeback on modern consoles with NeoSprint, and we’re happy to report that it largely holds up as a well-executed throwback.\nIt’s the latest in Atari’s effort to partner with indie developers to bring its classic IPs into the 21st century. Headless Chicken, the Costa Rican studio behind this loving retro revival, manages to retain the rubber-burning essence of the original games while incorporating contemporary gameplay modes, vehicle customization, and a surprisingly robust track builder.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One such example came courtesy of publisher THQ to celebrate the Wii release of the long-forgotten Big Family Games (Neighborhood Games). Rather than send just the game itself, THQ commissioned a 24K gold-plated Wii console to be carted off to Buckingham Palace. If nothing else, Lilibet could have sold it on for a few extra quid, but unfortunately, the console never made it to her.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It followed with Nintendo mentioning how pricing of its new releases would be based on a \"case-by-case basis\". Now, the latest game that seems to be generating some discussion about its pricing is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.\nThe price of this upcoming Switch release has been revealed on Nintendo's official game page, and it's been confirmed it will cost $60 (or the regional equivalent). It's led to some fans questioning Nintendo's \"pricing strategy\" after last year's release Metroid Prime Remastered only cost $40.

Bursting onto the scene in 2014, Yacht Club Games’ slick, throwback platformer caught the imagination of gamers both old and new. Its stunning aesthetic, tight controls, and humorous writing made it a must-play, while its ample secrets, tough but never punishing difficulty, and cheat codes added that crucial replayability factor. The game seemed to hit all the right notes. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. A treasure trove followed – and what a haul it was.\nThree campaigns starring three distinct and equally charming characters from the core cast, as well as a wonderful and woefully overlooked platform fighter. And that’s not even mentioning the amiibo line! If you don’t include Smash Bros. Ultimate fighters, only a handful of other companies' characters have been granted the honour of amiibo representation (Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, and Diablo, if you're wondering), and none that carry the prestige of a gold version. Each character is a thing of beauty in miniature, plastic form. We would’ve bought the whole Order of No Quarter if we could.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

          "description": "The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir \"ManliestDev\" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief rock-pusher. \r\n \nRead more",

The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.\nHappily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.\nRead more",

There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military. \r\n \nRead more",

The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game's background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can't work together to escape the inferno. Right?\nRead more",

Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

          "description": "A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game's protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don't report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini's adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate's daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.\nJim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. \"It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,\" he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.\n Read more",

But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on.

It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.\n Read more",

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts.

In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the \"themes or core elements\" of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a \"short-term way\", by the experience of having a daughter.\r\n \nRead more",

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, \"It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it\".\nI was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

But multi-grain timestamps was reverted just weeks after landing in the mainline kernel due to corner cases like a newer file with a coarse-grained timestamp appearing earlier than another file with a fine-grained timestamp. Due to subtle bugs like that, multi-grain timestamps were dropped before Linux 6.6 was even released while now there is a revised attempt...",

Little habits that define slices of your life like eras. The anime you grew up watching on Toonami. The sourdough starter you tried during the pandemic. The podcasts you listen to on the drive to work.\n\n\nGames can do the same, and it's that feeling that's washing over me on the eve of Final Fantasy XIV's latest expansion. Dawntrail arrives soon, less than 12 hours from me typing this. I've been spending all day trying to encapsulate what that means for me, and for players eager to set off for new adventures.\n\n\n\n\nTo those out of the loop, it might sound a bit strange.

This Pal can be pretty hard to track down, as it only spawns in a very specific and new area. Don't worry, I've done the hunting so you can reap the reward. \n\n\nOnce you’ve traveled west and found the island of Sakurajima, you’ll want to head to the northern desert area of the island. This is the only place in Palpagos where you can find Helzephyr Lux. \n\n\nWhere to find Helzephyr Lux in Palword, Sakurajima update\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you’re hoping to capture one, you’re going to have a bit of a fight on your hands. Helzephyr Lux are pretty powerful, and they really don’t like staying inside your Pal Sphere. I’d recommend taking some strong Ground type Pals to fight alongside you, and the best option for this by far is Anubis. \n\n\nAs well as this, you’ll want to have a good supply of high level Pal Spheres to throw at your weakened Helzephyr Lux. You’ll want Ultra Spheres, at the very least, but I’d recommend crafting and using some of the new Ultimate Spheres just to be safe. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you’ve captured a Helzephyr Lux, you’ll be able to use it as a flying mount by crafting the Helzephyr Lux Saddle, which unlocks via the Technology Ladder at level 52 costing 3 Technology Points. To make it, you’ll need the following resources:\n\n\n\n30 Leather\n\n\n10 Plasteel\n\n\n30 Electric Organs\n\n\n60 Paldium Fragments\n\n\n\nOnce you’re mounted on your Helzephyr Lux, you’ll be able to make use of this Partner Skill “Wings of Thunder”. This adds Electric damage to all of the attacks you use while mounted. \n\nThe post How to get Helzephyr Lux in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While most Shinies aren't always guaranteed, there's at least one proven method to get the exclusive Shiny Celebi. This method is a bit tricky and comes with a time crunch. To better prepare you for this task, we're here to guide you on how to get a Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go.\n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go\n\n\nYou can get a Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go by participating in Masterwork or Special Research. These events are a surefire method of encountering the critter, with a guaranteed spawn as a reward.\n\n\nFor example, completing the Whispers in the Woods challenge results in a Shiny Celebi. However, this is where the time restriction comes in, where it only lasts from June 28 to July 3, 2024. You'll also need to purchase a ticket for the Masterwork Research for $5. Fortunately, once you've opened this research before the deadline, you can take your time completing the task since there is no time limit.  \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nAfter you purchase a ticket in the in-game Shop, it can be found in your Item bag via the Passes section. Use it while the event is active to trigger a new lineup of tasks. Complete these objectives gradually to unlock the Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go. The quests shouldn't be too challenging to achieve, typically requiring you to catch a certain number of Pokémon or defeat Team Go Rocket members.\n\n\nOther than Masterwork, some Special Research can involve a Shiny Celebi. We've seen this in the past with the Distracted by Something Shiny event. This option is free to play, but it all depends on when Niantic hosts another one again.\n\n\nKeep in mind that a Shiny Celebi cannot be caught in the wild. So, you'll need to rely on these special events to get them.\n\nThe post How to get Shiny Celebi in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

In return, you can activate it once more to increase your immunity temporarily. The other Gear option could go many ways, depending on your playstyle. Nevertheless, if you are still deciding which one to pick, it doesn't hurt to add the Damage buff for 15 percent Extra Damage when Max is at 50 percent health.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAs for Max's Star Power, choose Super Charged to replenish her Super, Let's Go, much faster. This ability takes her speed to new heights with an additional boost in movement. Not only does it increase her speed, but it also works for any nearby allies. The Super Charged works well for Max's support role; however, you can choose Run N Gun instead if you prefer faster reloads. \n\n\nThese gear options will make it almost impossible to catch Max. Her speed is your best friend here, and you can use it to evade as many enemy attacks as possible.

There is a way to capture Selyne outside of the tower, but the bad news is that you can’t control it. \n\n\nOne of the new features added to Palworld in the Sakurajima update is Meteorites. These chunks of space rock fall from the sky and land close-by, allowing you to go and mine large numbers of Meteorite Fragments. That’s not all you can get, though. \n\n\nWhere to find Selyne in Pa\n\n\nWhenever a Meteor falls from the sky, it brings a rare Pal with it. The Pal the Metori falls with depends on where you were when the Meteorite fell. In order to capture Selyne, you’ll need to get lucky and be on Sakurajima Island when a Meteorite falls, because this is the only place Selyne will appear outside of Moonflower Tower. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSome other Pals which can appear during Meteorite events include Xenovander, which can appear in any location, and Xenogarde, which only appears if a Meteorite falls in the Dessicated Desert.\n\n\nSelyne is a Dark and Neutral dual-type Pal, and can be ridden as a mount after making the corresponding saddle. It’s a surprisingly good base Pal, boasting level 3 work suitability in Handiwork, Medicine Production, and Transporting. When killed or captured, Selyne can drop Cloth, Sapphires, and Precious Claws. \n\n\nSelyne’s Partner Skill, Celestial Darkness, will enhance Fire and Dark type damage while being used as a mount.

          "description": "If you’re itching for a challenging fight in Palworld, the Sakurajima update has provided plenty of higher level Pals to test your mettle. One of these Pals, Knocklem, can only be found in one very specific location. \n\n\nKnocklem can be found on the new island of Sakurajima as an overworld Alpha Pal. After the update, it’s now the highest level Alpha Pal you can possibly fight and it truly gives far better than it gets. Hard hitting and absolutely massive, taking on Knocklem is not for the faint of heart. \n\n\nWhere to find Knocklem in Palworld\n\n\nTo find Knocklem, you’ll need to head to the southern part of Sakurajima. The easiest way to do this is by heading to the Forgotten Island fast travel point and heading northwest. Once you’re there, make sure to unlock any fast travel points you encounter on the island itself. \n\n\nFly west along the desert region in the south of Sakurajima island, carefully because there are some vicious Menastings and Toco Toco here who will gladly take you out, and you’ll come across a cavern in the cliff. You’ll need to fly into this cavern if you want to take on Knocklem.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAt the end of this cavern, you’ll find Knocklem after a sheer drop, down in the water. Be careful if you're not ready to fight it just yet, Knocklem will start to attack even if you're just flying over, so keep your distance if you're curious. \n\n\nLike I said, Knocklem is massive and hits very hard. I’d recommend taking your strongest Pals with you as well as hard hitting weapons, such as a Laser Rifle or Missile Launcher. If you want to capture Knocklem, I’d suggest stocking up on Ultimate Spheres in order to maximize  your chances of a successful capture. \n\nThe post How to find Knocklem in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's check out every pre-order bonus for the Lovestruck expansion.\n\n\nAll The Sims 4: Lovestruck expansion pack pre-order bonuses\n\n\nFrom June 27 until September 5, pre-ordering The Sims 4's Lovestruck expansion pack will reward you with the following digital content bonuses:\n\n\n\nCry Me a River Eyeliner\n\n\nHerbert Heart Plushy\n\n\nBasic Breakup Double Bed\n\n\n\nThese three items are available as part of the Heartbreak Happens digital content pack, which you'll obtain in addition to the expansion pack. Once Lovestruck releases on July 25, you'll receive these pre-order bonus items in-game through the Create-a-Sim and build menu. While the build menu items will still cost you some Simoleons, the eyeliner is available as a customization option in the character creator.\n\n\nImage via Maxis / Electronic Arts (YouTube)\n\n\nThe Heartbreak Happens digital content features an eyeliner makeup feature you can use while your character expresses sadness over a recent breakup, their favorite show ending, or anything else that upsets them. Herbert is an adorable plushie you can use on your home lot, while the double bed is a themed bed that fits up to two Sims. Judging by the name, though, it might be better suited for one Sim who's getting over a breakup and needs the extra space. \n\n\nIf you don't purchase the Lovestruck expansion pack before it releases, don't worry; you'll have until September 5, giving you over a month of extra time to get the pack if you're interested in these bonus items.\n\nThe post All pre-order bonuses for The Sims 4: Lovestruck expansion pack appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Of all of the new Pals added to Palworld in the Sakurajima update, one has already become more beloved than any of the others — Croajiro. This frog-with-a-stick Pal is cute but deadly, and has an unexpectedly dark Paldeck entry. \n\n\nIf you’re diving into Palworld with the hope of immediately sprinting out and capturing a Croajiro, you’re in luck. The frog Pal is pretty widespread, although mostly showing up in the lower level forest biome and on Sakurajima itself. \n\n\nWhere to find Croajiro in Palworld, the Sakurajima update\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe easiest place to catch Croajiro is in the area immediately surrounding the starting area in Palworld. The Croajiro here are relatively low level, and therefore easily caught using most types of Pal Spheres. Even fights with high level Croajiros are pretty easy to get through though, especially if you go armed with either hard-hitting weapons or a strong Electric type Pal. \n\n\nCroajiro isn’t a very strong addition to your Base, with level one Handiwork, Transporting, Watering, and Gathering skills. When killed or captured, it drops Pal Fluids and Cloth. A recently caught Croajiro will have only Aqua Gun available to it as an attack.\n\n\nHowever, two things make this Pal one to catch - the Paldeck entry, which is as amusing as it is dark, and the rather interesting Partner Skill. \n\n\nWhen Croajiro is accompanying you as you explore, using his Partner Skill will enable you to climb on top of him and be flung high into the air. This is particularly useful when trying to reach high areas, or if you want to use your Parachute to travel across a long distance. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Croajiro’s Paldeck entry is as follows:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\nThe post How to get Croajiro in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

It can be hard to come across, but thankfully there are a couple of ways to make the process pretty simple. \n\n\nCrude Oil is used in a lot of high level recipes, from Flamethrower Fuel to Plasteel, which is needed if you want to upgrade your armor to the latest and most protective set. You’re going to need a lot of Crude Oil, but how do you get it?\n\n\nMost ways of getting Crude Oil are not guaranteed. It does drop from certain Pals, for instance I’ve obtained Crude Oil from both Maraith and Kikit during dungeon encounters, as well as in the wilds of Palpagos. You can also find Crude Oil during Supply Drops, or in chests around the Oil Rig Stronghold.\n\n\nThe second method is a guaranteed way to get Crude Oil.

          "description": "Blizzard revealed in a new Developer video for World of Warcraft Season of Discovery that the final phase for SoD, Phase 4, will begin on July 11, 2024. With this final phase, players will be able to reach the final level cap of 60 as well as enter the final two raids, Onyxia's Lair and Molten Core.\n\n\n\n\nWoW Season of Discovery kicked off back on November 30, 2023, with each subsequent phase hitting about 3 months later. This has brought us to now, with WoW SoD going into its fourth and final phase. The final Phase will stagger content releases for a couple weeks once Phase 4 begins.\n\n\nOn July 11, Season of Discovery officially enters Phase 4, raising the Level cap to 60 and unlocking all the remaining quests and zones.\n\n\nA week later on July 18, two World Bosses will become available through new Instance Portals. The two World Bosses are Azuregos the blue dragon of Azshara, and Lord Kazzak, the Doomlord from the Blasted Lands.\n\n\nFinally, a week after that on July 25, the two final raids of World of Warcraft Season of Discovery will go live. First, is Molten Core, a 20-player raid with 10 classic bosses featuring revamped loot, redesigned Tier 1 gear sets, and 'more'. Blizzard has been mum on the more part, but I have a feeling something cool Sulfuras-related awaits.\n\n\nAlso releasing on July 25 is the Onyxia's Lair raid which features the infamous black dragon and her many many whelps. Handle it!\n\n\nBlizzard hasn't revealed what's next in store for World of Warcraft Classic once the Phase 4 of Season of Discovery ends, but World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic has been live for just over a month now.\n\n\nSeason of Discovery Season 4 begins on July 11, 2024.\n\nThe post WoW Season of Discovery Phase 4 set to kick off on July 11 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree launched on June 21, 2024, and the official accounts are already reporting five million copies sold around the world.\n\n\nAccording to Bandai Namco Entertainment's original press release, these numbers come after just three days of the DLC's release. The X (formerly Twitter) account for Elden Ring thanked \"the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella.\"\n\n\n\n\nA new accolades trailer also dropped along with the news:\n\n\n\n\nMuch has been said about the difficulty of Shadow of the Erdtree in the days since its arrival. At first it was too brutal even for seasoned vets of Elden Ring and other FromSoftware titles. Then its unique leveling system got patched and players were split on the adjustments. Regardless of where folks fall on the usual \"too hard/not hard enough\" scale, it's clear plenty were eagerly anticipating the long-awaited expansion.\n\n\nNow, how many of those five million (and counting, presumably) Tarnished were able to access the DLC as soon as it launched? Show us the hard numbers, Bandai Namco! I'd love to know how many had progressed far enough through optional areas and encounters to enter the Realm of Shadow. \n\n\nHopefully everyone will get there eventually, because Shadow of the Erdtree is a hell of a send-off for Elden Ring as a whole. \n\nThe post Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree welcomes 5 million Tarnished in first three days appeared first on Destructoid.",

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20.

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017.

If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. \nThe reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is \"to be announced.\" \nCheck out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. \n\"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure,\" the game's Steam listing reads. \"Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies.\"\nHere are some Cattle Country screenshots: \n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier. \nWhat do you think of Cattle Country's reveal?

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. \nThough Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. \n\n\n\"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,\" the announcement reads. \"By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware.\" \nThough Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series. \nAre you excited about a native Minecraft version for PS5? Let us know in the comments below!",

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard.

However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

          "description": "Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.",

          "description": "We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.\n\n\nWhile the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule.

The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.\nFor our review of the recent Metroid Prime remaster, head here.",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
