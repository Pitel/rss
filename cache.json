We’ve seen plenty of sliding-tile puzzlers over the years, but Furniture & Mattress’ adventure is defined by its framing. It’s not an RPG, but it absolutely feels like one in many different ways. You have to use weapons to defeat certain monsters blocking your path. There’s a whole coming-of-age story about leaving home and growing up. There are even boss battles.\nIt’s as if puzzle designer Nico Recabarren (developer on Ethereal) built a completely new Rubix Cube, artist David Hellman (Braid) painted that Rubix Cube, and writer Nick Suttner (Carto) sketched out a world of fun and adventure around it, with everything taking place on a bunch of interconnected square grids. We’ve been enamoured since its reveal during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and going hands-on with the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we can’t wait to cause chaos by moving tiles around.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Just waiting on that call from Nintendo.\nIn a move that very few of us saw coming, PlayStation's Horizon series is heading to Nintendo Switch (albeit in the slightly more family-friendly, LEGO Horizon Adventures form). Is this a crossover episode? Are we witnessing the start of a bold new partnership between Sony and the Big N? Does this mean PlayStation IP will start leaking into the likes of Super Smash Bros.? We'd have to assume 'no' for that last one, but that's not to say that the devs of this latest LEGO adventure wouldn't be up for it.\nIn a new feature from Kotaku, Guerrilla Games' franchise development lead producer Tim Symons (who previously spent a decade at Nintendo of Europe as a Product Development Manager amongst other roles) was asked whether Horizon on Switch might lead to a Smash collaboration at some point down the line. While the dev hardly answered in the affirmative, he did confess that it would be \"nice\" to see. \"If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us,\" Symons told Kotaku, \"let me know\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Portable monsters for the kids (and kids at heart).\nWhen Capcom released Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin on Nintendo Switch back in 2021, there may have been some that said, \"Wait, there was a first game?\" It's worth remembering that the original outing of Monster Hunter Stories came towards the end of the 3DS era; in fact, it was released after the Switch had launched in 2017. It'd be understandable, then, if it was missed by plenty of gamers in a way that its sequel — on the current and dominant Nintendo system — was not.\nNow we have Monster Hunter Stories on Switch to right that wrong, and to ensure that Nintendo fans have both tales readily available. It's welcome, too; though these kid-friendly RPG outings for the series don't push the boundaries of the genre or even add much to the IP's impressive global reach, they are a pleasant introduction to a franchise that is traditionally rather challenging. This first entry comes with some enhancements, too, but it also feels unabashedly like the 3DS original, which isn't always a good thing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term \"open up\" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke.

In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts.

Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown.

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month.

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.\r\n \nRead more",

It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

In the process, you may choose to become \"the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class\".

I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.\n \nRead more",

Here's the god roll for The Call in Destiny 2, including perks and attachments.\n\n\nThe best perks, barrel, and magazine for The Call in Destiny 2\n\n\nThe way The Call is designed implies that this weapon will become your new primary, so how we're building this is to deal with add clear while having some respectable elite damage. Naturally, you'll want to mainly use your heavy weapon against things like bosses, while your secondary is a wildcard. With those goals in mind, you'll want to take the following perks and attachments:\n\n\n\nBarrel - Quick Launch\n\n\nMagazine - Tactical Mag\n\n\nPerk 1 - Lead from Gold\n\n\nPerk 2 - Desperate Measures\n\n\n\nOn the barrel side of things, Quick Launch helps to compensate for The Call's rather low projectile speed. The Tactical Mag, meanwhile, is a bunch of flat buffs all around that help improve some of the weapon's drawbacks a bit. As for perks, Lead from Gold always pairs well with Special ammo weapons that are meant to be primaries. That extra ammo is a godsend at times. Desperate Measures also provides some extra damage, and is especially useful in grenade/melee builds like some of the meta Prismatic builds right now. If you want, One for All is a nice alternative since you'll be hitting a lot of enemies fast with The Call.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 The Call god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While many weapons were introduced with Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, some of the most interesting are the Dealer's Choice weapons. These weapons are fairly good on their own, but when paired together can increase the rate that your super charges at. I run a build using them myself, and I get my super back alarmingly fast. One such weapon is particularly interesting thanks to its role in your arsenal. Here's the god roll for the No Hesitation auto rifle in Destiny 2, including attachments and perks.\n\n\nThe best perks, barrel, and magazine for the No Hesitation in Destiny 2\n\n\nThe No Hesitation is interesting due to its Support Frame perk, which causes hip-fire bullets aimed at teammates to heal them. This heal is incredibly strong, sending a guardian from red health to full in less than a second. Since it's so strong, we want to take perks that further its role as a healing machine.\n\n\n\nBarrel - Fluted Barrel\n\n\nMagazine - Flared Magwell\n\n\nPerk 1 - Physic\n\n\nPerk 2 - Circle of Life\n\n\n\nThe combination of Fluted Barrel and Flared Magwell is an iconic pairing for any weapon, providing stability, reload speed, and handling by a significant amount. Physic provides restoration whenever you rapidly heal allies, and you'll be doing that a lot, making these two a natural pairing. Circle of Life allows for some increased damage after providing healing to your teammate, which helps since you need to deal damage to consistently heal your teammates. Subsistence is a good alternative in the first perk slot if you feel that the restoration is a little overkill.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 No Hesitation god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

The designs will be available for purchase in Japan on June 17, coming to stores worldwide a week later on June 24. \n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nDespite being in the Live Letter, not all of the designs featured on the Uniqlo website are based on Final Fantasy XIV. The line includes designs based around Final Fantasy XVI and the Pixel Remaster series, too. \n\n\nThere are seven designs coming in total, each with a different design. The one that Foxclon can be seen wearing in today’s Live Letter features three chibi minions - Alpha, a Moogle, and Fatcat - emerging from the chest pocket, while others include quotes and iconic imagery from the long-running Final Fantasy franchise. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nDirector Naoki Yoshida can be seen wearing another of the Uniqlo designs in today’s Live Letter, this one featuring a full-front design of the Warrior of Light standing in front of an intricate sketched vista. \n\n\nAnother design, this one taking inspiration from Final Fantasy XVI, includes all eight of the Eikons who appear in the game, depicted in rainbow colors on the back of the shirt. On the front, peeking out of the front pocket, is a single Phoenix feather.\n\n\nThe best part about these shirts is the fact that they’re all relatively inexpensive. Each shirt will cost you $24.90 USD / £19.90 GBP.  Each shirt comes in sizes from XS to 3XL, so there really is something for everyone in the collection.\n\nThe post New Final Fantasy x Uniqlo designs are on their way this summer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Many want to see the number of guns slashed, begging Treyarch and Raven to remove MW2 and MW3 guns permanently. \n\n\nWhen Modern Warfare 3 was released, many thought that the guns from the previous year's game would be removed. This wasn't the case, however, with guns carrying through from the old gun, and all the guns from the new one added in too. \n\n\nThis meant there was well over 100 guns to choose from, which sounds good in theory, but ends up becoming messy, especially when the old guns are so weak compared to the new ones that there's no point in using them. \n\n\nA lot of guns in Warzone right now.

You may also want to link it now as Tennocon 2024 is coming up and it’s going to have some huge giveaways.\n\n\nHow to link your Warframe account to Twitch\n\n\nTo link your Warframe account to Twitch, log into the official Warframe site. It does not matter if you log in through your Nintendo, Xbox, or PlayStation account. As long as you log in to your main account, this is what you’ll need for the next step. \n\n\nWith this done, now click on your account on the top left of the screen. On mobile, it should be the same process. Click on Account Management and proceed. \n\n\nHere, you should find a section that says “Link Your Twitch Account” which should show you that you can get the free Broca Prominence Syandana if you do. If you are already logged into your Twitch account on the browser you’re doing this all on, it should all be done very easily.\n\n\nIf not, you just have to enter some login credentials related to your Twitch account. Once everything is done, you should receive the Twitch success page on the Warframe site. \n\n\nNow when you hover over your account on the top left of the Warframe website, you should see “Twitch - Linked” right below Cross Platform Save. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWarframe Twitch account link benefits\n\n\nWith your account now linked to Twitch, there are quite a few benefits besides the free Syandana. First, you can now participate in streams to get Drops. Typically, the Warframe Twitch Drops consist of some kind of resource or item for watching 30 consecutive minutes of a stream.\n\n\nThese typically happen on Prime Times or Dev Streams. However, with Tennocon events and other big gaming events, you can oftentimes expect to get a whole free Warframe by watching these said events. \n\nThe post Warframe Twitch link: How to link your Warframe account to Twitch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Rather than taking the form of a Zorlon Cannon-blasting shooter, Yars Rising is a hacking-centric Metroidvania with a demo now live during Steam Next Fest. As odd as the concept is, after playing some of what WayForward has in the works, I'm willing to hear them out.\n\n\nThis time around you take control of Yar — okay… so far, so good — which is the hacker handle for a young woman named Emi Kimura. A mysterious patron has hired Emi to hack her way into the shady corporation known as QoTech, and in true Metroidvania fashion she'll do so through exploration that expands with every new technique she picks up along the way. It's all presented in a clean, but somewhat stiff aesthetic that's serviceable…",

          "description": "The Euro 2024 competition kicks off later tonight. Meanwhile, EA hosted a set of simulations on EA FC 24 to try and predict the winners.\n\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time EA's taken a shot at predicting winners using its sports sim. In 2022, EA Sports shared something similar in FIFA 23 regarding who would go on to win the FIFA World Cup. Interestingly, the simulation was spot on as Argentina went on to lift the trophy in Qatar. Now, EA FC 24 is picking England as the simulated victor.\n\n\nEA FC 24 simulation predicts England as Euro 2024 winners\n\n\nEngland is one of the stronger squads in Germany, and Southgate's unit has a blend of youthful talents and seasoned veterans who can beat anyone on their given day. EA FC 24 seems to believe that The Three Lions could finally win the coveted Euro 2024 tournament. \n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, EA Sports has yet to give the breakdown of the entire tournament (which was available in 2022). The developers have only announced the results of the final showdown, which puts England against hosts Germany. It appears that Harry Kane will have an important say, as he scored the final goal in the simulation to help England win in the sim.\n\n\nIn reality, both Germany and England could qualify for the finals and go on to lift the trophy. However, it will be challenging as some strong contenders might want to change this prediction. Nations like France, Italy, and Spain won't be pushovers, and there are plenty of emerging contenders who could stake a claim for the trophy as well.\n\n\nWhile fans will need to wait till July 14 to know who wins in real life, they can create their own story in the EA FC 24 Euro 2024 mode. EA Sports has introduced plenty of interesting content in Ultimate Team as well; the Path to Glory promo is about to end, but Make Your Mark cards are coming soon.\n\nThe post Who wins the Euro 2024?

It has returned to the store six times since then, but never for very long, meaning that if you didn't get it in that window, you were out of luck. \n\n\nNine months since Syd's last appearance, the character has finally returned as part of Fortnite's 30.10 update, and here's how you can get it. \n\n\nBack after 264 days. Screenshot via Dot Esports\n\n\nHow to get the Syd Fortnite skin\n\n\nThe Syd Fortnite skin is currently available in the in-game Item Shop, and can be purchased for 1,200 V-Bucks. \n\n\nAlong with the skin, you also get two additional skin styles, a LEGO Fortnite skin, and the Cuddlebear Cutie back bling. Not bad for 1,200 V-Bucks. If you want even more content, the Beary Cuddly Bundle includes all of the above, plus the Weighted Spikegloves pickaxe and the Heartwave weapon wrap. \n\n\nHow long is Syd going to stay in Fortnite?\n\n\nAccording to Fortnite.gg, Syd will stay in the Item Shop until June 27, when it will disappear again. Of course, this hasn't been confirmed by Epic, but gives you a rough idea of when it will be removed. \n\n\nIf you want this skin and are definitely going to buy it, I'd recommend getting it as soon as possible, as you don't want to wait another 264 days for the chance to buy it. \n\nThe post How to get Fortnite’s Syd skin appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first of these will confront you right at the beginning, offering two paths: 'Take her hand' or 'Don't take her hand.' This choice is not to be taken lightly, as it will shape your entire experience in SMT V: Vengeance. We're here to guide you toward the most beneficial outcome.\n\n\nSMT V: Vengeance take the hand decision guide\n\n\nWhen you reach out to the body in the early cutscenes of SMT V: Vengeance, a voice will tell you that this girl is not ready to exist quite yet. You'll choose to either reach out to her or ignore it. Grab the girl's hand to experience the new storyline, Canon of Vengeance. On the other hand, don't grab the girl's hand if you wish to check out SMT V's original narrative, Canon of Creation. Newcomers may be inclined to take this route to see what events transpired in the original version. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlthough Canon of Vengeance could be seen as the 'evil route,' it's the only way to access the brand-new story. This pathway may involve more morally ambiguous choices and darker themes. It'll still follow a similar route to the original but with a few twists and turns. Vengeance's new character will also join your party frequently, resulting in exclusive dialogue and cutscenes. She's honestly a pretty good ally to have and can make battles much more accessible.\n\n\nEven if you're a beginner, you can still take the hand if you so desire. Like most SMT entries, Vengeance is a standalone experience, meaning you can enjoy the new content without feeling lost or overwhelmed by the game's lore or previous entries. Of course, it's entirely up to you to make the final decision.

Here's how to complete In Pursuit of Knowledge in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.\n\n\nAll answers to In Pursuit of Knowledge quest in SMT V: Vengeance\n\n\nIn Pursuit of Knowledge's quest start can be found above the Jouin U.

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kwo41nUwyeo\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

As part of that, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction\">we learned the series is implementing a new movement system</a>, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.</p>\n\n<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

First announced in <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/the-initiatives-perfect-dark-announced\">2020 at The Game Awards</a>, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofUi9DR9sc4\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.
