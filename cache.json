          "description": "It's more than zero.\nWe don't blame you if you’re intimidated by Falcom’s The Legend of Heroes: Trails series. This massive saga is now up to its twelfth mainline game in Japan, with the West falling behind at an alarming rate. However, one piece of the puzzle has been missing for years – Crossbell. After years of begging, fans are finally getting these “missing” games, starting with The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero. And, it turns out, there’s a reason people have been desperate to see these games get an official English localisation – Trails from Zero makes a pretty strong case for being one of the best entries in the entire series.\nAs with every Trails game, there’s always a caveat when trying to get into the series: Where do you start? The Switch, in particular, doesn’t make this easy, with only Trails of Cold Steel III and IV available on the platform in the West. But Trails from Zero is nowhere near as impenetrable as these future entries, with a plot and cast of characters that feel pretty self-contained. Of course, some characters from the Trails in the Sky games (which are currently only on PSP or PC here) make an appearance, references to past events slip in, and one primary plot thread is resolved from the Liberl arc, so it’s hard to deny that Trails from Zero is at its most rewarding if you’ve played Sky. But it’s much more accessible than the other two Switch offerings in the series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And one curious attendee at last week's TGS approached Sega to find out just how the game will run.

As you’d probably expect, this newest entry is largely cut from the same cloth as its predecessors, but with some meaningful nips and tucks here and there that help to give it its own personality.\nThe Beasts of Burden follows the story of a girl named Al’e (by default, you can name her whatever you want) who dreams of one day seeing the stars. Al’e lives in an underground village beset by frequent monster attacks, which are slowly chipping away at their limited supplies and remaining residents. Al’e is quite the capable warrior, but while she’s out fending off yet another monster swarm, another group of monsters manages to sneak into the village and kill everyone there. Grieving the loss of her mother and friends, Al’e is then whisked to the surface by a mysterious boy who seems to want to help. Here, she learns that she holds a special power that allows her to control monsters to do her bidding. Armed with this newfound ability and aided by her new ally, Al’e sets out on a quest for revenge against the ones behind the incident that destroyed her home.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. \r\n\n\r\nKey features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A huge number of videos purporting to show in-game development footage for GTA 6 have been plastered across various internet forums this morning, because apparently no one can wait until a video game is actually anywhere near finished before they feel compelled to spoil it for all and sundry. \nThe 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won't find a link to them here, because the truth is, they're simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn't going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it's actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point? \nRead more",

Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…\nRead more",

Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.\nIndeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time. \nRead more",

Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. \nIt doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping. \nRead more",

Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.\nBefore we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.\nRead more",

          "description": "Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. \"Let me in!!\" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. \"I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!\"\nIf you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.\nRead more",

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about. \nRead more",

The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. \nIt's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something. \nRead more",

The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn't arrived.\r\n\nIt seems like that will change soon.

It's not going to be quite the massive open world adventure 'em up that the last few entries have been (don't worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series' 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan.

It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series.

Tato nerovnováha ohrožuje demokracii a omezuje inovační potenciál evropského výzkumného prostředí a ekonomiky. Během tří let výzkumníci vyvinou jádro evropského otevřeného webového indexu (European Open Web Index (OWI)), které bude základem pro nové internetové vyhledávání v Evropě. Projekt navíc položí základy pro otevřenou a rozšířitelnou evropskou otevřenou infrastrukturu pro vyhledávání a analýzu webu (European Open Web Search and Analysis Infrastructure (OWSAI)) založenou na evropských hodnotách, principech, legislativě a standardech\".",

So while I understand the appeal of something like Portal with RTX, a \"reimagined\" Portal kitted out with ray tracing, that doesn't mean it's strictly better. It's different! And you may or may not dig it.\nAlongside (pricey!) GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, Nvidia announced Portal with RTX as free DLC coming to Steam in November for Portal owners. 15 years later, if you can believe it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZHBl5yWqJk\n\"Every light is ray-traced and casts shadows, global illumination indirect lighting naturally illuminates and darkens rooms, volumetric ray-traced lighting scatters through fog …",

The Netflix series follows Sonic and pals in some new adventures, though it looks like they'll be dealing with some old villains in the process.\nWe've seen a few quick teasers of the upcoming series, but today's teaser trailer shows a pretty hefty amount of Sonic Prime.\nNotably, you can spot a few familiar faces in the teaser. Shadow the Hedgehog, Big the Cat, and of course, Eggman.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUb16YyU-04\nIt seems like there's some kind of multi-verse, shattering of reality situation going on here. Whatever plans Eggman and other characters like Shadow are up to, Sonic will have to handle them.\nThe series is set to premiere this holiday season, and a landing page is live over on Netflix right now if you want to set up a reminder.\nYear of the blue blur\nIt's been quite the year for Sonic, all things considered. The movie franchise side of Sonic the Hedgehog has done quite well, and looks to be expanding further. Another movie is planned, which isn't too surprising given the second film's stinger, and a Knuckles series is on the way too.\nOn the video game side, Sonic fans already got a classic collection in Sonic Origins. And there's Sonic Frontiers on the way as well, taking the high-speed action into the big open world.\nIt's been a big year for fans of the blue hedgehog. And for Netflix, Sonic Prime could set a good tone for video game adaptations moving forward. The company's had some great success with Castlevania, Arcane, and now Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. At least in terms of animation, the adaptations have been largely solid. While Sonic Prime is a bit more kid-friendly than those series, it'd be nice to see Sonic getting a solid series among all the adaptations coming out of Netflix.\nSonic Prime speeds onto Netflix later this year.\nThe post Netflix Sonic Prime series gets a new teaser trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

A localization is currently in the works.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgKpNzoqwG8\nAs previously reported, the Cosmic Fantasy Collection will consist of two titles: 1990's Cosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu, and 1991's TurboGrafx CD sequel Cosmic Fantasy 2: Adventure Boy Van. The latter title was the only game in the series to find its way to western shores, and remains something of an obscurity regardless, so retro gaming fans will definitely want to consider giving this new remaster a space on the radar.\nThe Cosmic Fantasy franchise would see relative success upon its debut in Japan, thanks to its quirky comedic style and obligatory love of naughty cheesecake fanservice. The series would spin off into several other adventures, and would also receive manga and anime adaptations, as well as a range of toys and merchandise. An intriguing little lost oddity in the annals of '90s gaming. Thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign, these forgotten titles will soon be experienced by a whole new generation of anime and RPG fans.\nCosmic Fantasy Collection launches in Japan on Nintendo Switch December 15.\nThe post Cosmic Fantasy Collection blasts back from the past in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

But then it was quickly removed from sale. That's bad! As of today though, that crisis has been averted, and Radiant Silvergun is now live on Switch.\nSo what went down with Radiant Silvergun on Switch? Thankfully, we have a full report from the publisher, Live Wire\nThe same day Radiant Silvergun went live on Switch, it was taken down. A lot of folks speculated that it was ratings-related, which was confirmed by the publisher several days later on Twitter: \"The reason it was removed from the store is because the product's rating has changed. We have created new data and have already submitted it to them.\" The team also took the opportunity to begin to address some of the bugs that were present in the briefly-released port.\nSo after all that, the game is back up. The browser listing may not be live depending on your region, but the game is currently live on the actual Switch eShop.\nIt's a good thing this was resolved, because Radiant Silvergun is an all-time classic shmup (shoot 'em up), and it deserves to be on as many platforms as possible.

          "description": "Hearts of iron\nElectronic Arts has revealed a new Marvel project. Today, the publisher confirms that EA Motive is working on an Iron Man video game.\nThe seemingly untitled-for-now project will be a single-player, third-person action-adventure game starring Iron Man, Marvel's suit-clad hero. EA Motive, the team behind this new project, has previously worked on Star Wars: Squadrons, and is heading up the new Dead Space remake releasing in January.\nAccording to the EA announcement, this game will feature an \"original narrative\" that taps into the history of Iron Man. It will also tap into Tony Stark. EA says it will channel the \"complexity, charisma, and creative genius\" of Stark.\nMarvel Games is collaborating on the project with the Montreal-based EA Motive. The project is currently in pre-production, and more updates will arrive as the team gets further into development.\n\"It’s an honor and privilege to have the opportunity to make a video game based on one of the most iconic Super Heroes in entertainment today,\" said executive producer Olivier Proulx in a statement today. \"We have a great opportunity to create a new and unique story that we can call our own. Marvel is encouraging us to create something fresh. We have a lot of freedom, which is so engaging for the team.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-duwSMIgNMU\nMore Marvel on the way\nOf course, this Iron Man game isn't the only new Marvel video game collaboration. At the recent Disney and Marvel games showcase, Skydance New Media teased its upcoming game centered on Captain America and Black Panther. That project also doesn't have a title yet. But the team behind it is Amy Hennig's new studio, which is working on a Star Wars project, too.\nWith Midnight Suns just around the corner too, there's a lot of Marvel on the way. We'll have to wait and see what Motive is up to with its take on one of Marvel's core Avengers.\nThe post EA Motive confirms it’s working on a single-player Iron Man game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Also, the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection\nThe Japan Game Awards ceremony took place this past weekend at TGS 2022, and the results are in for the top 10 award-winning games. As a bit of context, each year an organization called the Computer Entertainment Association of Japan doles out awards at TGS, honoring a variety of games from multiple regions.\nHere's the full list of 10 games that won the Future Division category (in no particular order), which quite literally highlights titles that are coming up, and haven't been released yet:\nA Space for the Unbound\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty\nExoprimal\nStreet Fighter VI\nSonic Frontiers\nFinal Fantasy XVI\nForspoken\nAtelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End and the Secret Key\nLike a Dragon: Ishin\nMega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection\nNote that not all of these games were even playable at TGS, so the award isn't necessarily tied to quality and hands-on experience.\nThe two that definitely stand out are Forspoken and Sonic Frontiers, who have had polarizing receptions since their debuts. Exoprimal is also on the \"wait and see\" list. The rest, to a degree, makes sense. I've played the Wo Long demo and can vouch that so far, it looks really promising. With Naoki \"Yoshi P\" Yoshida on Final Fantasy XVI, things seem to be on track. Street Fighter VI is obviously a darling. Plus, the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection award seems to have lumped in both separate SKUs, which would make it a powerhouse of a re-release.\nIf you're interested, the official Tokyo Game Show YouTube account uploaded the entire hour-and-a-half ceremony, which you can watch below.\nThe full 2022 Japan Game Awards ceremony:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2doNGaUZ1Q\nThe post FFXVI, Sonic Frontiers, Wo Long take home Japan Game Awards at TGS 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nearly 10 minutes of recap material\nNintendo has launched an official Splatoon 3 tutorial on their YouTube channel — which they are dubbing a \"Beginner's Guide.\"\nClocking in at nearly five minutes, it walks you through basically everything you need to know to play the game. Even the setup! Nintendo starts simple, giving folks background info for the \"kid and squid\" morphing mechanic, then inking/weaponry, then game modes. It's actually super useful, as the gameplay is simplistic enough to literally watch this video, then dive in. This is going to be especially useful for the upcoming Splatfest demo, as some folks may have not played the series up through this point.\nCoincidentally, you'll also get a ton of new footage for Splatoon 3. None of it is revelatory per se, but people who are really looking at every single detail until release might want to check it out, as there's a lot of environmental showcasing going on. It also serves as a nice recap of most of the stuff the team has shown so far in various Nintendo Directs and showcases.\nWith Splatoon 3, I'm at the point that I'm typically at in the \"post-Direct\" lifecycle of first-party Nintendo games. I've seen enough, I just want to play it!\nSplatoon 3 tutorial video (pre-launch):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoGcH4Cr22Y\n[Update: Post-launch, Nintendo has provided an additional tutorial video on their UK YouTube channel, which you can watch below.]\nSplatoon 3 tutorial video (post-launch):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_RV26Q-vqE\nThe post Here’s a quick tutorial for Splatoon, amid the launch of Splatoon 3 (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Submitted for your approval: This fantastic \"Basketball Bridget\" mod for Arc System Works' slick anime fighter Guilty Gear Strive.\nThe new look, meticulously crafted by modder manmadee, sees the happy-go-lucky scrapper trade in her nun-like hoodie and trademark Bullet Yo-Yo for some sweet gym sweats, fingerless gloves, and a meaty B-Ball. She looks adorable as all hell, and is set to take the court by storm, and I pity any luckless opponent who is getting set to take Bridget's basketball straight to the face... I mean, it's happened to us all at least once, right?\nCheck out this video from GAMETV. (And keep an eye out for a cameo by the Mod King at 1:10)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJCoDzxH4s\nBY THE BUCKET!\nManmadee's mod comes with several color variants, which include options for eyeglasses, cat ears, and an instantly recognizable purple-and-yellow ensemble, as worn by NBA team L.A. Lakers. Because of the yo-yo's propensity to return to Bridget's hand, it makes her basketball attacks simultaneously believable and also hilariously physics-defying — but that's all part of the fun. I think she looks fantastic, and the new gear is a great way to celebrate her highly publicized arrival to the GG Strive roster.\nYou can pick up Basketball Bridget, alongside manmadee's other great mods, over at GameBanana.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. It is coming to Xbox in spring 2023.\nThe post White Girls Can’t Air Dash: An awesome Basketball Bridget mod for Guilty Gear Strive appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Switch is also 720p\nSonic Frontiers framerate variations have been revealed, according to an attendee who spoke to Sega at TGS this past weekend.\nSonic Frontiers framerate breakdown:\nBased on the report, it seems like the PS5, PS4, and Switch editions will have the following options:\nPS5: 4K visuals with 30 FPS — or HD visuals with 60 FPS\nPS4: HD visuals with 30 FPS\nSwitch: 720p with 30 FPS\nNo information could be discerned about the Xbox editions (or PC), however, it would make perfect sense for the Xbox Series X/S to line up with the PS5 settings, with the Xbox One edition lining up with the PS4. Sega has also clarified, according to the report, that the Switch version will sport 720p30 visuals docked and in portable mode. All versions also have \"variable\" framerates, so performance may change, especially given that it's an open world game.\nIn 2022, a \"performance and visual mode\" toggle for a AAA game on a current platform is expected, as is 720p and 30 FPS for a third-party Switch game. All of this lines up with what anyone could have guessed on paper, but now we'll have to see if it actually plays out this way in practice. I'm a bit worried about the PC port in particular.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers framerate will be 60 FPS on PS5 in HD mode, 30 FPS on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

In practice, though, it's a bit of a nightmare — I can't even look at the screen for more than a few seconds without being overcome with nausea. But if you can stomach the herky-jerky camera, and if you're just dying to play Spider-Man in first-person, this new mod has you covered.\nSpider-Man's release for PC means that modding the game just got a whole lot easier, hence why the aptly named \"Spider-Man PC First Person Mod Web Swinging\" mod by well-known GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 modder Jedijosh920 has gained some attention online. They also released a slightly less stomach-churning video where the camera stays fixed in place as Spidey spins and flips around, so that's at least a little bit better.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylHkF4ExBE\nMind you, I used to be a roller coaster junkie, but unfortunately as I've gotten older, my motion sickness has only gotten worse and worse. When I came across the video showcasing the mod on Twitter, I had to scroll away pretty fast at risk of ending up like Liza Minnelli in Arrested Development. \nEven so, I have to admit that this is something I'd like to experience, motion sickness permitting — although it's pretty sad to be hit in the face with the reality that I wouldn't be able to handle life as a web-slinging superhero simply because I get sick by moving around too much. Oh well, I was never made for the crime-fighting life anyway.\nEither way, it's always fun to see modders put a new spin on some of our favorite games, and to the brave souls out there who are somehow playing this in VR, I commend you.

The Switch port is expected to arrive before the end of the year, although a specific release date was not announced.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lwnDx4qnAo\nXiaomei and the Flame Dragon's Fist, (originally titled Fire Dragon Fist Master Xiao-Mei), is an ultra-retro scrapper inspired by the first scrolling brawler of all time, Irem's 1984 coin-op Kung Fu Master. Operating on a simple 2D plane, the player guides the beautiful young martial arts specialist as she battles her way through a relentless throng of bandits, monsters, and crazed animals on a mission to save her sister Xiaoyin from the evil influence of the mysterious Dark Dragon.\nThe Nintendo Switch port, which launched in Japan back in May, features some tweaks and improvements from the original PC release. These include an alternate mode featuring Xiaoyin herself; brand new cutscenes — ably voiced by popular idol unit Suika; improved FM sound effects; a gallery mode; and a remixed soundtrack, composed by Sega veteran Hirofumi Murasaki, (of Shinobi III and Dragon Force fame). So if you're yet to experience the simple-but-frantic action of Xiaomei's world, then this incoming localization will offer the best experience yet.\nXiaomei and the Dragon's Fist will launch in the west on Nintendo Switch later this year.\nThe post Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon’s Fist is headed west on Switch this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, the company confirms it has sent all reservations for the Q3 window.\nThe Q3 bucket, ranging from July to September, is slightly ahead of pace and so Valve is already getting a head-start on Q4. The store's already been updated with a new description, as it extends from September on through December.\nThe Deck manufacturer announced in July that it has been fulfilling demand sooner than estimated for the portable PC. As such, Valve started bumping reservations up further in the queue.\nNow, it looks like those Q4 reservations are starting to roll out. So that's a PSA, for those of you waiting on Steam Deck tickets, to get your wallets ready.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvokyBOYe8Y\nMore on deck\nThat's not the only Steam Deck news from the last few days, either. The official dock for the Steam Deck was on display at last week's Tokyo Game Show 2022, as shared around on sites like Reddit.\nWhile some third-party solutions have been around, Valve's official dock has been delayed. I've since picked up a powered USB hub for my own purposes, and it does a decent amount of what any dock would do. But the ability to prop up and park the Deck in it, like a Switch dock, is a big part of the appeal.\nNo target window has been set for the release of the Steam Deck dock. \"We're working on improving the situation and will share more info when we have it,\" reads the official statement from the time.\nStill, while the dock is backed up, the Steam Deck seems to be flying off the production line. Those who are in line for one should hopefully not be waiting too much longer to get their reservation email.\nThe post Valve is getting a head start on Steam Deck Q4 reservations appeared first on Destructoid.",

Rockstar confirmed the leak's validity this morning, adding a statement addressing the leak.\n\"We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way. Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations. We will update everyone again soon, and of course, will properly introduce you to this next game when it is ready.\"\n\nUnlike GTA, we've seen quite a bit of Diablo IV through various previews and trailers. Still, a leak's a leak, and this puts some footage out without any context.\nBlizzard has not commented on the leak as of this writing. The studio has released an update on Diablo IV, however. An endgame closed beta is on the way, with direct invites rolling out using gameplay data.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be2ZlWW0fwM\nDiablo IV is still a ways off, at the very least until next year. And a lot has been happening over at Activision Blizzard as well.\nThe post Diablo IV also sees a sizeable leak of footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It debuted at TGS, but there's a full English audio translation\nWhile Octopath Traveler 2 is slated for release on February 23, 2023, on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch, we can catch a chunk of it now. If you wanted some Octopath Traveler 2 footage following the recent Nintendo Direct reveal, you got it! Square Enix just gave us 20 minutes of it thanks to a TGS stream. Don't worry though! Although the stream was done for TGS, there's a full live English translation baked in as audio commentary.\nKicking off at roughly 25:00 in the below video, we get a full 20-minute walkthrough of the game, and some of the aesthetic and design changes in the sequel. One big element that the team showcases is elevation, which brings \"height and depth\" to the maps. There's a bit of variation involved with the game's designs, with footage of a forest village and an \"old west-like town.\"\nBased on this Octopath Traveler 2 footage, natural time progression is in, too, and there will be \"drastically different music\" in some day/night cycles, including tracks that sound unique compared to the original. The team wanted to ensure that there wasn't a sense of repetition between playing the original and the sequel, and it gave them a good excuse to \"explore different genres\" of music to boot. The developers mused on how much of an undertaking it was, having to design day/night music for all of the locations in the game, only a portion of which were shown off via a brief look at the world map (31:00 in).\nIdeally, Octopath Traveler 2 will address some of the common complaints of the original (including how things homogenize after the individual character stories are completed): because so far, they're still nailing the aesthetic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XuTb462yCg&t\nThe post Square Enix just gave us 20 minutes of Octopath Traveler 2 footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Shiny Super Saiyan\nAnime RPG Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is on its way to PS5 and Xbox Series X, confirmed publisher Bandai Namco during the past week's Tokyo Game Show festivities. The 2020 adventure title is currently back in development at CyberConnect2, and is preparing to wow fans in 2023 with an impressive new rerelease on current-gen console platforms.\nThe new versions of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot — which is already available on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Stadia, and Nintendo Switch — will sport improved textures as well as boosted light, shadow, and water effects. A short comparison clip, which you can check out below, depicts the open-world adventure running on modern hardware, and it has to be said it is quite an attractive upgrade, given that the original version is already an authentic adaptation of the legendary anime franchise.\nhttps://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1570761217618108416?s=20&t=tUNx-l32ofCdOGVmpgfJFA\nIn addition to the new ports, Bandai Namco also revealed a new DLC story expansion, that will focus on the arrival of Son Goku's father, Bardock. The Bardock: Alone Against Fate DLC will be a loose retelling of the events depicted in the 1990 OVA Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku. The story expansion will cover events such as Bardock's time as part of Frieza Force, and the arrival of his legendary son. The new DLC is the first of three story expansions, which should keep Kakarot fans engaged for the coming year, at the very least.\nDragon Ball Z: Kakarot for PS5 and Xbox Series X and the Bardock: Alone Against Fate DLC will launch together in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMlWhBkAO0M\nThe post Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot looks delightful on PS5 and Xbox Series X appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "See more than others ever have\nDeveloper Sorath blasted onto the scene in 2016 with the first-person arcade shooter Devil Daggers. Now, the studio is back with another bizarre shooter, with possibly even more mind-bending action in Hyper Demon.\nHyper Demon launches today on PC via Steam, for $14.99. As the tag advertises, it's about slaying demons in a world like no other. And, apparently, from a view like no other either.\nThe faster you slay demons in Hyper Demon, the harder the game gets. But your score also ramps higher and higher. There is, apparently, an end. The question is, can you make it there?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScglDSi9KUs\nMuch like Devil Daggers, Hyper Demon has minimal controls. Collecting gems will allow players to buff up their capabilities, or charge up and execute massive super moves.\nThe trippy effect you see on the screen is what developer Sorath describes as \"groundbreaking spherical projection,\" which gives the player a wide peripheral view without pinching or shrinking the center of the screen. It is truly something to see in motion. And it allows for fields of view stretching out to 180 degrees.\nAlongside that, the game also has a holographic rear view overlay. So basically, you can have complete 360-degree awareness, if you can learn to visually parse all the chaos happening on the field.\nThe devil inside\nDevil Daggers was definitely a memorable experience from 2016. It had a dark and intense vibe, taking the general concept of being a devil who shoots magic daggers from their fingers into an arena shooter frenzy.\nIts visuals were particularly wild, so it's cool to see Hyper Demon continue to push this into almost surreal places. With a surprise launch too, this is a nice Monday morning surprise for folks who love visually unique arena shooters.\nHyper Demon is out now for PC on Steam.\nThe post Hyper Demon is Devil Daggers creator’s trippy new FPS, out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The last time we heard about this port was roughly three years ago\nThree years ago, Xbox boss Phil Spencer gave us hope that Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox was a distinct possibility. But it's still in limbo. I even reached out to Microsoft and Square Enix in 2020 to see if any movement had been made, and was given a \"no comment\" response from both parties.\nYet, Japanese site Game Watch spoke to Spencer at TGS 2022, who gave a brief comment on the situation. The short of it? There's still no major progress on Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox, but talks aren't completely dead yet. Here's what he had to say:\n\"We certainly announced that (laughs). Naturally, we haven’t given up yet. This is a commitment from both Microsoft and Square Enix to gamers and we will continue to coordinate our efforts.\"\n\nIt's not much to go on, to be sure! But at the same time, it's comforting that Spencer, in 2022, isn't willing to throw in the towel yet. Back in 2020, Final Fantasy XIV producer Naoki \"Yoshi P\" Yoshida noted that it would take a lot of resources to make that happen, so perhaps the wheels are still being greased: \"we have to think about long-term planning with additional platforms, we need additional testing for that particular platform. So it kind of exponentially grows the amount of resources that needs to be allocated.\"\nThere's also the consideration of Microsoft and Sony working in tandem, given that they need to cooperate for the game to function cross-platform. Currently, Final Fantasy XIV is available on PC, PS4, and PS5. With the move to the Xbox platform, with full cross-play and cross-progression intact (this is something Square Enix has been hardline on), it would be an even more formidable MMO force to be reckoned with, with a bigger audience.\nThe post Phil Spencer once again muses on the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

Whether you're talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.\nToday, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn't show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it's bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.\nSonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…",

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

          "description": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

          "description": "Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8.

However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. \n\n\nAs the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. \n“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”\nFae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.",

Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.\"\n\n \nPikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. \nPikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and \"very close to completion.\" Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that \"it is progressing,\" seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!\n\nNintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out! \nAre you excited for Pikmin 4?

All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.\"\nPreoders for the Switch version begin today.",

CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. \nDuring the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. \n\n\n\"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,\" Nowakowski said during the call. \"Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future.\" \nAs for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. \nIn the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow should CDPR further develop its Cyberpunk IP?
