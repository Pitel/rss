          "description": "A sublime September showcase?\nThe long rumoured and expected September Nintendo Direct has been and gone like a flash of lightning, and those 40 minutes certainly flew by for us.\nThe dust is settling and while we're fully ready to share our overexcited thoughts, let's round up some of the highlights. Splatoon 3's DLC, Side Order, is coming in Spring 2024 and it looks pretty darn amazing. the GBA and DS are having a moment right now with remakes of Mario vs. Donkey Kong and Another Code (a bundle which contains both the DS original and the Wii sequel). Princess Peach's new video game finally has a title — Princess Peach: Showtime! - and a release date of March 2024. And Wave 6 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's DLC is bringing back some fan-favourite characters this winter.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The upcoming RPG from Yoshitaka Murayama, the creator of the Suikoden series, is launching on Nintendo Switch and other consoles on 23rd April 2024.\nToday's announcement during the Nintendo Direct came as a bit of a surprise to us.

April falls right in that window, of course, but we're still surprised to get a date so soon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Matcha the mood.\nAs a series, Pokémon is one that has held onto tradition pretty firmly. In the 25+ years since Red & Blue’s release, the fundamentals of the game haven’t really changed – you explore a world, you fight Pokémon, you catch Pokémon. Last year’s Pokémon Scarlet & Violet was the mainline series’ first big attempt to change things up a bit, expanding exploration to an open-world setting and letting you progress in your own way. But fundamentally it was still Pokémon, warts and all.\nIt’s perhaps fitting, then, that the first part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC, The Teal Mask, is set in a land besotted with tradition. The people tell folk tales, new native Pokémon are steeped in history, and with the Kitakami region's clear Japanese inspirations, it feels like a throwback to the older days. This does mean that while The Teal Mask is a fun time that builds on Scarlet & Violet’s strengths, it also exposes the base game's – and the series’ – weaknesses that much more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Perhaps most noticeable is the remastered visuals and graphics which are looking particularly tasty, but you combine that with new stages, enemies, bosses, an updated weapons system and co-op for two players in Story Mode and four players in Arcade Mode, and we'd say publisher Konami is onto something special here.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!\nIt's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.\nRead more",

          "description": "On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was \"fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. \r\n\nAnd yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I fear we are reaching that point with the life and times of Mary Read, my Starfield character and nowadays quite accomplished space pirate, who has sworn never to land on a planet ever again. \r\n\n\r\nImmediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.\n  \nRead more",

You do the math(s).\nI actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in. \nRead more",

A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.\nTurns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.\nRead more",

It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll. \nRead more",

          "description": "You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.\r\n\n\r\nGunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. \nYou play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?\nRead more",

Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.\nBut it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun.

Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet.

Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type \"player.setpos x 10\" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type \"setgravityscale 0\" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.\nSpace sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of \"player.setpos\" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. \nAnd after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.\nRead more",

          "description": "The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word \"immersive\". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. \r\n\n\r\nIn theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, \"the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.\nRead more",

I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.\nRead more",

I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.\nIt's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it \"diverting\" rather than \"entertaining\", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.\nRead more",

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.\nBut the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!'

          "description": "On today’s installment of Bad Calls I Have Made, I will cop to never really buying the idea of Starfield needing an SSD. Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.\nSo, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.\nRead more",

          "description": "Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. \r\n\n\r\nThe game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself!

A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. \r\n\n\r\nMy first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like \"spam\", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming.

It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe.

Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of \"I think I could just about afford that one day\" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.\nUnder The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to \"what [he's] been through\" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life.

It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.\nRead more",

Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. \r\n\n\r\nAn immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say \"playing\", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade.

Whether it's out of excitement or concern depends on the person. \n\n\nTo someone like Microsoft executive Sarah Bond, AI's prospects are exciting. She's the head of creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, and in an interview with Inverse, Bond sheds light on where she believes gaming should go.\n\n\nAccording to Bond, gaming is on the \"precipice of a YouTube or SoundCloud moment\" where technology will allow greater collective freedom. She refers to a future of \"citizen creators,\" a democratized creation space further fueled by AI.\n\n\nUndoubtedly, Bond's position is a divisive one as ethical questions ar…",

It had some ups and downs, but certainly went out with a big closer.\n\n\nBoth today's Nintendo Direct and State of Play ended on remakes of beloved RPGs, which is pretty rad. In Sony's case, Square Enix brought out the big guns with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, locking in a launch date for the second entry of its remake trilogy that really isn't too far off.\n\n\n\n\nBut let's not discount the other announcements, either. There's a surprising reveal of some DLC for Tales of Arise, some fresh looks at known games, and of course, virtual reality games. No State of Play is complete without some VR.

          "description": "During the September 2023 State of Play, we got a Release Date Announcement Trailer for Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. At the end of the trailer we got a first look at the Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth Collector's Edition, and oh boy is it beautiful. Included is a 19-inch Sephiroth statue—in pure Sephiroth form, might I add—as well as a sick-looking steel book. Unfortunately, you're gonna have to shell out a lot of Gil for this one. The Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth Collector's Edition is priced at $349.99.\n\n\n\n\nMateria(l) things\n\n\nAs per usual with Square Enix Collector's Editions, supplies are limited and only available through the Square Enix Store. Full contents include the Deluxe Edition of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the Sephiroth statue, and the following DLC:\n\n\n\nMoogle Trio Summoning Materia (DLC)\n\nA summoning materia that can call \"Moogle Trio\" in the game.\n\n\n\n\nMagic Pot Summoning Materia (DLC)\n\nA summoning materia that can call \"Magic Pot\" in the game.\n\n\n\n\nAccessory: Reclaimant Choker (DLC)\n\nA choker with an effect of restoring HP when an enemy is defeated.\n\n\n\n\nArmor: Orchid Bracelet (DLC)\n\nA bracelet that gives courage to traverse an expanding world.\n\n\n\n\nArmor: Midgar Bangle Mk. II (DLC)\n\nA bracelet worn by travelers leaving Midgar.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs much as I want this, I don't think I can justify it. The statue looks decent quality, but certainly not price-of-a-console quality. But, for those who collect this stuff, I'm sure this is just what they were looking for. Still, it does feel like the price on these Collector's Editions continues to rise while the contents shift to mostly digital stuff.\n\n\nFor me it's all about the steelbook, which it appears actually comes with the Deluxe Edition which is priced at $99.99. That seems a bit more reasonable to me.\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Rebirth releases exclusively on PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth collector’s edition has a cool Sephiroth statue, but it ain’t cheap appeared first on Destructoid.",

Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn looks to add more onto the tale of Dahna and Rena on November 9, 2023.\n\n\nShown during today's State of Play, the trailer shows the whole gang reuniting, one year after the events of the main game's story. Alphen looks to be taking care of a child that's on the run due to her lineage, and the crew gets wrapped up in the drama around it.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the return of some familiar faces and locales in the trailer, as well as some new sights to see. In a press release, Bandai Namco says to expect over 20 hours of new game content with new quests, dungeons, boss fights, and a new story arc.\n\n\nIt sounds like there will also be a bit of a new start in this expansion. In a PlayStation Blog, producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that although Beyond the Dawn is a sequel to the main story, the team wanted all users to be ale to enjoy the game at \"the appropriate level of design.\"\n\n\n\n\"In order to ensure this, a certain level of skills and other statuses are provided at the start, and we did not adopt a simple transfer of levels and statuses from the main game. Instead, we have prepared bonuses such as money and skill points based on the clear data of the main game, so we hope that you will enjoy the new story while taking advantage of these bonuses and developing the characters to your own liking.\"\n- Yusuke Tomizawa, General Producer, Bandai Namco\n\n\n\nArise once more\n\n\nHonestly, I really didn't see this one coming. I really liked Tales of Arise, and it seemed to get some newcomers into the Tales series in general too. Even though the original game wrapped up pretty neatly, I won't say no to more time with this team.\n\n\nTales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn is set to arrive on November 9 for PlayStation\n\nThe post Tales of Arise gets a new adventure with Beyond the Dawn in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Put down that controller. Dr. Tom Tilley has shown us the way to play Puzzle Bobble (also known for years as Bust-A-Move in the West) as the Gods of Finger Dexterity intended: by using a salad spinner.\n\n\nIf you’re like me, you don’t put dirty plants in your mouth, so you might not know what a salad spinner is. My research suggests that it’s a device used to remove water from leafy vegetables after you wash them. It uses centrifugal force to separate the water and dry the leaves. This means that when you drown the salad in ranch dressing, the creamy sauce will stick to it.\n\n\n\n\nTo turn this device of vegetal torture into a controller, Dr. Tilley used some cardboard, an optical mouse, and an external button. Then, when the crank is turned, the mouse movement is read on the game. I’m not sure if this is a PC port of Puzzle Bobble I’m not aware of, or if he’s edited the input. That seems like it would be the hardest part of the process for me.\n\n\nThis isn’t the first Puzzle Bobble controller that Dr. Tilley has MacGyver’d together. Previously, he has created a similar contraption using a coffee grinder. He also got a little more constructive with some tubing. On top of this, he made a Katamari Damacy controller with an actual ball. It’s pretty creative stuff. Meanwhile, I can rarely be bothered to set up my racing wheel.\n\nThe post A salad spinner is definitely the best controller for Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move appeared first on Destructoid.",

In this first look at how the sequel aims to evolve the open world concept, senior director Bryan Intihar showed off the game’s world, which has effectively doubled in size when you consider the inclusion of both Brooklyn and Queens. \n\n\n\n\nPlayers can now take advantage of the web-wings, which, when paired with traditional web-slinging, can completely change how they explore the game world. There will be more varied locales to check out with these new transportation mechanics, including Midtown High and Miles Morales’ very own Brooklyn Visions Academy. As players traverse New York fighting baddies left and right, they will be able to switch between Peter Parker and Miles Morales at will, and because of the PlayStation 5’s advanced hardware, the transition time is nearly nonexistent, according to Intihar.\n\n\nTied to the increased size of the overworld is the new district rewards system which will unlock a variety of rewards, including fast travel points, on the off chance players don’t feel like manually traveling. One feature that makes a return from past installments is the ability to customize appearance. According to Intihar, Spider-Man 2 will feature more than 65 different suits to pick from.\n\nThe post Latest Spider-Man 2 trailer looks at its open world features appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Foamstars test run launches with two game modes, Smash the Star and Happy Bath Survival.\n\n\nAs for dates, Square Enix included a Foamstars open beta schedule adjusted based on timezone.\n\n\n\nSeptember 29, 6pm - October 1, 11:59pm PDT\n\n\nSeptember 30, 2am - October 2, 7:59am BST\n\n\nSeptember 30, 3am - October 2, 8:59am CET\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Smash the Star, you'll compete in a team deathmatch mode where the rules change as challengers are knocked out.

It will be releasing on PS5 February 29, 2024. Just a little under four years since the release of Final Fantasy VII: Remake.\n\n\nThe announcement comes with a new trailer that shows a nice mix of old and new. Vincent shows up, but we only see the back of his really epic mullet. We get a peak at Junon, which is looking pretty fly. Tifa also mentions weapons, the optional bosses from the original version. The Golden Saucer makes an appearance alongside Chocobo Racing.\n\n\n\n\nCloud rides around on a Segway while wearing a pastel-colored polo shirt. I don't remember that happening in the PS1 title, but my memory is more perforated than a tea bag. There's a bunch of other stuff that happens, but I don't want to say anything confidently in case I just imagined it.\n\n\nIt's some good stuff, nonetheless. I always felt that Final Fantasy VII got a lot of mileage out of its style, even when the story was sometimes a bit lacking.

We also got a new gameplay trailer that showed off the co-op mission-based gameplay of Helldivers 2.\n\n\n\n\nHelldivers 2 is making the transition from top-down 2D to third-person 3D.

And next summer in Baby Steps, you'll need to take that advice very, very literally.\n\n\nShown during today's State of Play, Baby Steps is the latest physics-and-coordination game from Bennett Foddy, Gabe Cuzzillo, and Maxi Boch. You might remember Foddy from classics like QWOP or Getting Over It. Well, Baby Steps certainly looks to be carrying forward that legacy.\n\n\n\n\nAs the player character struggles to navigate even basic terrain without tripping over their ankles, this really does look like an enjoyably frustrating experience. The added humor might be make-or-break for you, though I personally dig it. I'm really most intrigued by the different obstacles though, especially that skateboard. It's a set-up built for all kinds of mishaps.\n\n\nI think you know if you want these kinds of experiences or not, just at a glance. For me, I'm down; and even if you don't want to play Baby Steps, it's probably one to watch your favorite streamer play anyways.\n\n\nWe also got a mildly updated release window for Baby Steps, as the trippy antics aim for Summer 2024.\n\nThe post Baby Steps takes another step towards launching off in Summer 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sony has three more to choose from, so hopefully you have better luck.\n\n\nThe three colors of the \"Deep Earth Collection\" are \"Volcanic Red,\" \"Cobalt Blue,\" and \"Sterling Silver.\" They're a little more saturated than the red, blue, and white colors that you can already get.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I'm happy with the blue and purple shades that came in the last batch of colors. It would probably take something really radical to get me to change covers again.\n\n\nIf you haven't changed covers on the PlayStation 5, it's pretty easy. Each one basically just clips on. I don't know what else you want me to say.\n\n\nSony's rather lavish trailer doesn't really say when they'll be coming out.\n\nThe post Three new colors for PlayStation 5 controllers and covers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the Sony State of Play presentation today, we got a look at some new content coming for Resident Evil 4 remake. The juiciest reveal here is the return of the Separate Ways campaign starring Ada Wong, which will finally hit the game next week on September 21.\n\n\nIt was perhaps a given that Separate Ways would make it back to Resident Evil 4 in one way or another. Its exclusion from the remake's original release didn't escape ire from fans, so it's good to see it here now. For those who want to play as Ada in the current console generation, here you go.\n\n\nImage via PlayStation YouTube\n\n\nAdditionally, Capcom also teased a free update for The Mercenaries that will also go live on the 21st. While it didn't elaborate, the splash screen showed Ada and Wesker, so it's safe to assume the update will add them both to the roster.\n\n\nThis news came alongside another look at the upcoming VR update to Resident Evil 4, which looks and sounds about as you'd expect. So if you have a PlayStation VR headset, it looks like you'll have a few reasons to return to the world of survival horror in the near future.\n\nThe post Resident Evil 4 remake will finally get Separate Ways campaign on September 21 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This comes days after a controversial announcement that the company would require payment for every first-time game installation made using the engine.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the company told Bloomberg that Unity has \"taken immediate and proactive measures\" to ensure employee safety. The offices will remain closed for Thursday and Friday at minimum, as the company works with law enforcement.\n\n\nThe changes were an unpleasant shock to developers, as messaging regarding fees was often unclear and in flux. A Unity representative later clarified what kind of download would require a fee, but the damage had been done. Smaller developers fear what this measure could have initially meant, and the company's attempts at clarification don't seem to have quelled fears.\n\n\nThe Austin and San Francisco offices were closed, per Bloomberg's report.\n\n\nUnity is already facing trouble due to what many see as a short-sighted decision, but that doesn't warrant threatening employees.

          "description": "After the Japanese Nintendo Direct, Nintendo updated the webpage for the Super Mario RPG remake. A few new details were revealed, including the fact that you can swap the soundtrack between the remastered and Super Nintendo versions.\n\n\nThere are few game soundtracks that are as indelibly etched on the caverns of my ears as the one for Super Mario RPG. It’s a bizarre and unique mix that sounds nothing like Koji Kondo’s more iconic tunes from previous Mario games. However, from the bouncing sounds of “Beware the Forest’s Mushrooms” to the walking basslines of “And My Name’s Booster,” it’s packed full of top-shelf tracks.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nThe soundtrack was put together by Yoko Shimomura, who is one of the most prolific composers in the industry. She made contributions to soundtracks like Final Fight and Street Fighter II, then continued on through Parasite Eve, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy XV, and so many others. Personally, I’d argue that Super Mario RPG was her best, but that’s not an easy choice.\n\n\nIt’s important to note that Shimomura is returning to remix the soundtrack in the remake. From what we’ve heard, it sounds fantastic. I’ve heard the original version enough over the years that I’m ready to hear it in a new way, but if you’re someone who doesn’t jive with newer instrumentals, this will certainly bring relief.\n\n\nAlso noted on the site is the addition of an easier \"Enjoy Mode\" and a bestiary to look up information on all the monsters you fight.\n\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases on Switch November 17, 2023.\n\nThe post The Super Mario RPG remake will let you swap back to the OG soundtrack appeared first on Destructoid.",

The sequel to Hades will launch in Early Access in Q2 of 2024 on both Steam and the Epic Games Store. The team went on to clarify that the exact date, pricing, and system requirements will be revealed later. Prior to the Early Access release, there will also be a limited technical test for a handful of players. This test will serve as a way to solve technical and compatibility issues before Early Access.\n\n\n\n\nEarly Access worked wonders for the original Hades\n\n\nThe original Hades also followed this Early Access schedule. The Early access period lasted almost two years, and really helped shape and polish Hades ahead of launch.\n\n\nSimilarly, Hades 2 will have several major updates that add content as EA progresses. The story will expand and add more characters with each update leading up to the v1.0 launch.\n\n\nHades is roguelike done right, and I'm excited to see what Hades 2 will expand on. I'm typically not a fan of the Early Access model but it seems like Supergiant Games utilizes it in all the right ways. Hades was great in EA, and even better when it was released fully. Hopefully, Hades 2 will follow the same route and end up better for it in the long run.\n\n\nHades 2 will enter Early Access in Q2 of 2024 on PC. Whenever it fully launches later, it will also be on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Hades 2 will return to hell in Early Access in Q2 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is celebrating two milestones at the moment, starting with the one-year anniversary of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime. The official Twitter made sure to remind us that, somehow, an entire year has passed since the series premiered on Netflix. Add in the fact that the Phantom Liberty expansion is looming on the horizon and you have reason enough to revisit Studio Trigger's evocative take on Night City. \n\n\nOne of Trigger's heavy-hitters helped celebrate the anniversary and point us toward the upcoming release. Yoh Yoshinari, who has a long history in the anime industry and has been with Trigger from the start, did so with a new illustration. The piece of Edgerunners art puts Lucy next to Songbird, one of the netrunners featured in Phantom Liberty. Check out Yoshinari's dynamite work below.\n\n\nImage via CD Projekt Red\n\n\nMy Moon My Man\n\n\nLike Edgerunners director and Trigger co-founder Hiroyuki Imaishi, Yoh Yoshinari did a lot of work with Gainax prior to Trigger. This included everything from handling key animation for Gunbuster 2 and FLCL to directing the Gurren Lagann Parallel Works OVA. Yoshinari also directed the Little Witch Academia and BNA: Brand New Animal anime at Trigger. For Edgerunners, he provided storyboards, character designs, chief animation direction and more.\n\n\nAs nice as it would be for this art to herald a second season of Edgerunners, it remains a standalone series. Considering how well Trigger adapted the world into a tightly-paced 10 episodes, perhaps that's for the best. Besides, if you need a Cyberpunk 2077 fix, you have update 2.0 on September 21 and Phantom Liberty on September 26. \n\nThe post Cyberpunk: Edgerunners celebrates anniversary, hypes Phantom Liberty with new illustration appeared first on Destructoid.",

This release is separate from the Phantom Liberty expansion that launches\nsoon after as the update focuses more on overhauling systems found in the base game.\n\n\nAlthough both have been advertised alongside each other, they launch on separate\ndates, with the update coming on September 21.

And on a day that saw an update for the Super Mario RPG remake and a Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door announcement, that’s saying something. Square Enix has released a demo for the upcoming Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince for Nintendo Switch, which you can download right now on the eShop.\n\n\nFunnily enough, this appears to have had no English announcement of any kind. It just kind of appeared, with the assumption that RPG turbo nerds like me would just notice regardless. And I mean… I guess I am writing this, so that worked.\n\n\nWhile you can import your demo save data over to the full version of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, this one comes with a few catches. While monsters you capture/synthesize will carry over, their levels and stats won’t. Perhaps this is to prevent people from over-leveling in the demo and trivializing the full game, we can’t say for sure. On the plus side, the demo will still allow you to explore and capture monsters after you clear the available story content. That’s a nice touch for those who just want to dive into the mechanics here.\n\n\nI have so many good memories of playing Dragon Warrior Monsters on Game Boy. The Dragon Quest Monsters subseries has been dormant for Western audiences for a while now, so I’m hoping this one will deliver. At the very least, a demo will give us a good indication of how this one is shaping up.\n\n\nDragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince will launch on Nintendo Switch on December 1, 2023,\n\nThe post Surprise demo for Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince is out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes will launch on April 23, 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\n\n\nAnnounced during today's Nintendo Direct, Rabbit and Bear Studios' RPG successor to the Suikoden series is locked in for release. Originally planned for this year, Hundred Heroes was pushed back to Q2 2024 for extra development time.\n\n\nHow's that panning out? Well, today's trailer certainly makes Eiyuden Chronicle look promising, to say the least. The video spotlights protagonists Nowa, Seign, and Marisa, as well as tons of characters to recruit and team-up attacks.\n\n\n\n\nThere's also a home base to build out and fill with your growing roster of companions, as befitting a follow-up to Suikoden. Those, plus special attacks like the Magical Girl technique we saw and a pirate shark too, make it look like there's a lot of variety in the cast.\n\n\nAssembling the heroes\n\n\nEiyuden Chronicle has been in development for a while, since its Kickstarter accrued a massive amount of cash back in 2020. Developed by Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama under Rabbit and Bear, Eiyuden has looked more and more like a return to the format's roots with each new glimpse.\n\n\nAnd even in its spin-off, the Eiyuden pitch has looked promising. 2022's Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising was a pleasant surprise, setting the stage for Hundred Heroes while focusing on a more action-RPG take. Much like Bloodstained prepared the way for Ritual of the Night with Curse of the Moon, Rising has me eager to see Hundred Heroes arrive.\n\n\nThankfully, it's not far off. Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is setting an April date in an increasingly stacked 2024, but I'll definitely find a way to make some time. Hopefully the revival goes well when Hundred Heroes hits Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on April 23, 2024.\n\nThe post Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes sets a date for April 23, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes none other than Facepunch Studios, best known for Garry's Mod and the brutal survival game Rust.\n\n\nIn a statement on Garry Newman's (not that one) blog, the founder of Facepunch has outright said that Unity can now \"get f*cked.\" This alone pretty much spells out how most people feel about what's going on with the popular game engine at the moment.\n\n\n\n\nNewman expands on this by saying that there's trust has now been broken between Unity and pretty much every developer that uses its toolkit. The post then concludes by saying: \"Rust 2 definitely won't be a Unity game\"\n\n\nDoes this mean a follow-up is in development?\n\n\nIt's difficult to not take this as an off-the-cuff way of confirming that Rust 2 is in the pipeline. It could well have just been Newman letting off some steam by saying that any future projects will not be utilizing Unity products.\n\n\nAs such, we can't say for definite whether a Rust follow-up is in development. It could well be that Facepunch Studios is looking to do a sequel of its popular PvP/PvE/PvLE (Player vs. Literally Everything - that one's mine) title. We'll have to just keep an eye on whether this gets elaborated on in the future.\n\n\nThe general takeaway from Newman's post is that nobody is happy with the direction Unity is currently heading in. Seemingly, the reasons are obvious to everyone but Unity itself.\n\nThe post Rust developer says Rust 2 ‘won’t be a Unity game’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

The company laid out not just the holiday season ahead, but a pretty good chunk of the next year too, for the Switch in today's September 2023 Nintendo Direct.\n\n\nToday's stream held a decent mix of surprises and familiar faces, and the Switch maker saved a big gun for last with the Paper Mario announcement.

          "description": "Wargroove 2, the sequel to the top-down strategy game Wargroove received a brand new trailer and a release date in today’s Nintendo Direct. According to the new trailer, Wargroove 2 is set to release next month, on October 5.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer spends some time highlighting the game’s story, which involves a set of “mysterious new factions” that players must contend with. Wargroove 2 allows players to “command the land, sea & sky” in their pursuit of total victory. Also, the trailer takes a moment to focus on “supercharged grooves,” which are akin to final blows that are unique to each Commander, including “Powerful Form,” “Raise Dead,” and “Chain Reaction.” \n\n\nIn addition, Wargroove 2 lets players upgrade their unit with a variety of items that can seemingly be found in active battle. In the trailer, for example, a character locates and pulls a sword from the ground whilst in the middle of active combat. It would seem that Wargroove 2 will also allow players to create their own maps, campaigns, and cutscenes with a new system improved over the original Wargroove.\n\n\nWargroove 2 is set for release on October 5. It will be available on the Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam.\n\nThe post Wargroove 2 gets a new trailer, October release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "On the other side of the pond, Japan's version of the Nintendo Direct gave us some details on the game that Onion Games has been teasing for a while now. Titled Stray Children, it looks like a return to Yoshiro Kimura's roots at Love-de-Lic, as the style is extremely evocative of Moon: Remix RPG Adventure.\n\n\nOnion Games has been teasing a new \"RPG-style\" title for a while now but has been extremely coy about showing anything off. To date, I think the most we've seen is some concept art. Getting to see the game in motion; it's exactly what I was hoping for. Better yet, the opening seems to show the protagonist as a lover of video games that gets sucked into another world through the TV screen. That's speaking my language.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the trailer shows off an RPG-like battle set-up, one of the menu items allows you to talk to your enemy. Knowing the sort of joy-maker games that Yoshiro Kimura favors, it's likely that you're supposed to befriend enemies. It has a lot of the same sights and sounds of a typical Love-de-Lic affair, and the trailer mentions that staff from Moon: Remix RPG Adventure are working on this one. I'm unsure if that refers specifically to Kimura, but that would qualify.\n\n\nThe best news of all is that the trailer gives us a Japanese release window for Stray Children, and it's soon: this Winter. While the trailer is entirely in Japanese, Onion Games has stated that it will be coming to the West. The bad news, however, is that its release over here is still \"TBD.\"\n\nThe post The Japanese Nintendo Direct shows off the latest Onion Games project, Stray Children appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. \nAnother Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. \nCheck out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAfter Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley's tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. \n\"This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more,\" Nintendo's description of the game reads. \"Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games.\" \nAnother Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024. \nHave you ever played these games?

The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. \nTwo days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players' ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. \nUnity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company's Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.\n [Source: Bloomberg]",

F-Zero 99 is a battle royale version of the game, similar to other recent Switch experiments like Tetris 99 and Mario 35. Check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nThe game will take place on classic F-Zero courses with machines from the original SNES game, and as the name implies, it will support up to 99 players at once.

At the time, they referred to the project as Untitled Princess Peach Game but during today's Nintendo Direct, the company revealed its official name: Princess Peach Showtime! \nPrincess Peach Showtime hits Switch early next year on March 22. Alongside the reveal of the game's name and its release date, Nintendo also shared new details about what to expect. Princess Peach and some Toads took a trip to the Sparkle Theater to see a play. But when the Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch arrive, it's up to Princess Peach to save the day . \nCheck it out for yourself in the Princess Peach Showtime trailer below:\n\n\nPrincess Peach hops onto the stage with the help of Sparkle Theater guardian Stella to take down the Sour Bunch and hopefully, their leader, Wicked Grape. To do that, Princess Peach will have to make her way through a variety of plays, transforming along the way. We see her become Swordfighter Peach, with a Muskateer-esque outfit to go with it. As Swordfighter Peach, she can use a rapier to take down the Sour Bunch and other enemies before her. But that's just one play. \nToday's trailer also revealed Princess Peach will become Detective Peach to determine who is stealing artifacts from a museum. We also see her become Patisserie Peach in an effort to find stolen desserts, and Kung Fu Peach to stop the Sour Bunch from taking over a martial arts school. \n\nThis was just a taste of the transformations that await in Princess Peach Showtime, too. \nPrincess Peach Showtime hits Switch on March 22, 2024. \nAre you excited for Princess Peach Showtime?

Today, we got a new look at wave 2 of the game's expansion pack, titled Side Order. You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nThe trailer takes place at the foot of the Spire of Order, a new location largely devoid of color. We see the return of Agent 8, the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion interact with a new character named Acht (which is notably German for the word \"eight\"), who claims to go \"way back\" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Meanwhile, Pearl, her co-host, seems to be embodying a robot that accompanies Agent 8 throughout the world.\nAcht gives Agent 8 color chips that modify their abilities, like increasing certain damage types or boosting run speed. After the trailer, Takahashi mentioned that the DLC was designed to be played \"over and over again,\" possibly implying the game will have roguelike elements.

          "description": "Nintendo has consistently been a fan of airing Nintendo Directs during September, with the usual September Directs being some of the most exciting of the year. And the company will continue that streak in 2023 as it has announced a Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, September 14.\nThe company revealed this on Twitter today, stating that the direct will run for \"roughly 40\" minutes at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET on September 14. \nTune in on Sept. 14 at 7 a.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused on #NintendoSwitch games releasing this winter.\nhttps://t.co/tUb8vyZNfx pic.twitter.com/WJcQ5ZQl1b\nSeptember 13, 2023\nAs for what to expect, there's a lot of unknowns circling this Direct. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That's the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. \nDetective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it's likely we'll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There's plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we're hoping to learn more about the company's 2024 plans. Considering \"this winter\" dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.\nOn that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we'll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. \nThis Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. \nWhat do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct?

While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. \n\nWhile details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. \nAs for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.\nResident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021.

Rather than tasking players with cooking a proper dish, developer Terrifying Jellyfish presents a playspace of ingredients, tools like blowtorches and meat tenderizers, and a suite of odd abilities that change gravity, freeze food, and make your culinary ingredients dance — all in the name of playfulness. While levels contain hidden experiences you can unlock by specific interactions, there's hardly a central goal in Nour. Similar to Townscaper, this joyful release is more akin to a toy than a game, and it's so much fun. \nPlay With Your Food in This Episode of New Gameplay Today:\n\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke.

          "description": "Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.\nPer Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. \n\"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it,\" Baird tells EW. \"It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story.\"\nStray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here. \n[Source: Entertainment Weekly]",

This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions.
