When Golf Story arrived on Switch in 2017, taking the RPG slant of Game Boy Color's Mario Golf and pushing it in new directions, it set a particular tone for lighthearted narrative and a quirky take on its sport; inevitably, then, Soccer Story has drawn inspiration and applied similar ideas with its own spin on the beautiful game. We don't make the comparison as a criticism, and indeed developer PanicBarn makes its own jokes and acknowledgements of its reference sources. The question then becomes whether Soccer Story has enough of its own ideas, and quality of execution, to become a worthy addition to this subgenre of pixel-based comedic sporting adventures.\nThe answer? Yes, it does, albeit with some caveats.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A 2.5D Paper Mario tribute with an adorable little ghosty as the main character? What's not to like! Unfortunately, it seems that the game which was released on Switch yesterday is not the version that the developer, Conradical Games, ever wanted to see the light of day.\nPublished in a post on the game's official Twitter account, @OutboundGhost, the developer apologised for the state that the game currently finds itself in. According to this message, the lead developer received a number of comments concerning issues with the game at launch and has now gone public, stating that \" I never wanted this version of the game to come out\", but the release was out of their control.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Show me ya moves!\nFun fact: if F-Zero GX—the last home console game in Nintendo’s seminal futuristic racing series—were a person, they would be old enough to vote now. Indeed, it’s been far too long since we’ve gotten a new F-Zero, which has led to copycats filling the void as best as they can. Some of these, like Fast RMX or WipEout Omega Collection, have done a great job of adding their own spin on that intense gameplay. Others, like Warp Drive, have fumbled the ball a bit. Warp Drive started as a mobile game a couple of years ago and now has made its way onto the Switch, but don’t let its origins immediately turn you off. Despite its shortcomings, there’s a genuinely enjoyable time to be had here; we only wish it could be more consistent.\nThough Warp Drive is certainly a fast game, we would say that its gameplay has more in common with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe than it does with F-Zero or Fast RMX. Though you’re moving at lightspeed through gravity-defying courses, much of your success hinges on how effectively you can acquire and use items to give yourself an edge. Much like in Mario Kart, there are various points on the track where you can drive over a line of ‘warp crystals’ that will give you an item, though here the effect is not random. You can hold onto each crystal as long as you want, and each one can be used to either launch a missile, activate a short boost, drop a mine behind you, or teleport you to an alternate route on the track at specific points.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Up for a challenge?\nRemember back in September when it seemed that every game ever was getting released all at once? One such title to land on the Switch in this period was Haiku the Robot - a post-apocalypse-set metroidvania with an adorable main character which looked like it had leaped right off of a GBA cartridge. Now the game is getting its first free content update on 16th December, and things are about to get a lot more challenging.\nThe update will add a whole new style of play to Haiku with the introduction of 'Corrupt Mode'. Much like Hollow Knight's Steel Soul Mode (only not as pull-your-hair-out frustrating), this new challenge will have you exploring a different side of Arcadia with only one health point to your name. You get hit, you go straight back to your last save station (see? much friendlier than Steel Soul).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The game is heavily inspired by the games of Vanillaware; renowned developers of games like Muramasa: The Demon Blade and Dragon’s Crown. This inspiration can be seen straight away with the wonderful hand-drawn art style, and even down to the smaller elements like the animation and the uhh… let’s call it “sometimes gratuitous” character designs.\nA 2D hack-and-slash adventure with some light Metroidvania-style exploration elements, Sword of the Vagrant places you in the shoes of Vivian; a young sellsword sailing toward the island of Mythrilla in search of her missing father. After being faced with a mysterious owl guy, her ship conveniently wrecks on the beaches of Mythrilla. After assisting a young local woman, Vivian returns with her to a village in ruin and is soon cursed by an evil witch who demands that she retrieve magic artefacts, or else she will destroy Vivian instantly. To ensure our hero does not try and escape, the witch sends her disciple Camden along for the journey to keep watch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developers Striking Distance Studios have acknowledged the issue and say they'll drop a patch later today to fix it, but we'll see.\nThey've also revealed their post-launch roadmap, so hopefully it'll run well enough by February for you to enjoy the New Game+ and Hardcore modes. \n\n \nRead more",

Erik Wolpaw say he and fellow Portal 2 penner Jay Pinkerton have even floated that idea around Valve, to a positive response. It's totes on the cards, is what it sounds like.  \nThe news comes from Wolpaw's recent interview with YouTuber DidYouKnowGaming, which is also worth a watch to learn about all the ideas Valve didn't wind up using in Portal 2.

I'm about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn't quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. \nImagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3's dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I've ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they'd earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it's been a while.\nRead more",

But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they \"still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly\" via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they'll go \"where the players are\".\nRead more",

Asassin's Creed Valhalla's free, final content update has arrived a week early, sending Eivor off to North America for one last hurrah.\nThere are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what's going on, which is a shame because I'd love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.\nRead more",

Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October.

          "description": "For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.\r\n\nQuestion is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.\nRead more",

Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.\nBut removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history.

That game was The Walking Dead: The Final Season.\nHaving played all three previous seasons of Telltale's choose-your-own-zombie-apocalypse tearjerker (plus the 400 Days DLC and the Michonne spin-off), it's no surprise that I was incredibly invested in Clementine's story by The Final Season. I'm not a big kid person, typically, but you'd have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn't you? Even though, by the time TFS rolls around, she's grown into medium-sized Clem, and is a bit bloody scary to boot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. \nMade by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.\nRead more",

          "description": "Classic RPG Heroes of Might and Magic III has been transmuted into a board game, with its Kickstarter campaign currently on over 2.6 million pounds. That's 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?\nThe board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn't after a nostalgia kick.\nRead more",

          "description": "Mirrorshades cannot be the iconic eyewear of modern-day cyberpunk, I learned during a Microsoft Teams meeting. For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.\nRead more",

I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?\nAnyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.\nRead more",

Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's \"still so many little and not so little things to do\" before the big day hits on December 8th. \"[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission,\" he says over email. \"I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then.\"\nBut he also says he's \"happy at the same time\". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to \"build a bridge between the worlds\" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Harmonix's DJ game is going offline\nThe sun is setting on Harmonix's DJ sim Fuser. The studio is shutting down live services and sales for both Fuser and its DLC on December 19.\nThe news arrives through a statement, confirming that neither Fuser nor its DLC tracks will be up for sale after the 19th. Those who already own Fuser will still be able to play Campaign and Quick Play, using any DLC they have already acquired as well. But online services and other options will be turned off.\n\"Thank you again for your support and for all the amazing mixes over the years,\" reads Harmonix's statement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lNyZCKe6EM\nHarmonix confirmed earlier this year that while it was ending paid DLC releases for Fuser, the team would keep on supporting the live, in-game features. While some cosmetic content drops had arrived, streams and special sessions were wound down.\nEpic acquired Harmonix in 2021, saying the company would continue rolling out DLC while also working with Epic on Fortnite projects. Specifically, musical journeys and gameplay for the battle royale, which has hosted a number of big concerts throughout its lifespan.\nDance 'til you're dead\nThis is, frankly, a big bummer. Fuser was a genuine surprise for me, as an evolution of the Dropmix format that felt really good to toy around in. It wasn't as loudly groundbreaking as the plastic instrument revolution, but it was an enjoyable experience that led to some fun multiplayer nights with friends, making surprisingly good or beautifully cursed mixes. It wasn't for everyone, but it certainly worked for me.\nAs Harmonix works with Epic on whatever its next projects look like, I'm hopeful that some of the creativity seen in Fuser carries forward. For the DJs of Fuser, though, there are still a few weeks left to join together for sick mixes.\nThe post Fuser is sunsetting live services and sales this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

It might even be my favorite because, although there was never a port of Raiden for the 8-bit console, developers had to be a bit creative. Famicom shooters are more measured since bullet hell is technically not possible within the strict sprite limitations. Not that I dislike bullet hell, I just prefer a saner approach.\nWhile my personal favorite to point to is Gun*Nac, Konami’s Japan-exclusive Crisis Force is a close second.

When added to the previous sales of the remixed release on PS4, Persona 5 Royal hits a high of 3.3 million copies sold. I know what you're thinking, \"Can't get classier than that, Moyse\". Oh no? Well, when you add all Persona 5 branded titles — Persona 5, Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight, and Persona 5 Strikers — Joker and his trendy friends have sold a grand total of 8.3 million video games.\nFor those keeping count, that's somewhere in the region of 16.8 million Persona titles overall, showing metaverse runners everywhere that the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off series has never been hotter. The Persona 5 franchise managed to eik several solid games off of the back of its initial 2016 launch date, (not forgetting the Nintendo 3DS release Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth and Joker's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate). And, with the lofty sales of the Persona 4 Golden PC port, it seems clear that the popular JRPG franchise is set to run and run.\nPersona 5 Royal is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post The Persona 5 brand has sold over 8.3 million games to date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new sequel follows the path forged by its celebrated predecessor Victoria 2, which was released way back in 2010, and thus it has been quite some wait for mouse-clickers everywhere. In fact, much like Half-Life 3, Victoria 3 had become something of an in-joke to the dedicated community, constantly referenced as a title that was wanted, but seemed unlikely to come into existence.\nSpanning a century between 1836 and 1936, Victoria 3 offers players the opportunity to pick up the role of one of 100 countries, shaping the people, politics, and technological and economical growth of this era-defining period in human history. As you might expect, matters do not always transpire smoothly, and while the new sequel angles on the side of diplomacy, sometimes matters must be settled on the battlefield. Victoria 3 received high praise from critics and fans, including our own strategy fiend Anthony Marzano, who awarded the title a hefty 9.5 out of 10.

Also, Nini comes from space, so there's gonna be some sci-fi elements in there as well.

As such, PC players may have concerns as to whether their rig can run the shiny-looking shocker.\nNever fear, as developer Striking Distance Studios has released the PC specifications required in order to, (on paper at least), bring the grim gore of The Callisto Protocol splashing onto your monitors. I'll have to admit, it's a pretty beefy ask, with the Recommended settings asking for a higher-end graphics card and a pretty powerful CPU. Turn down the settings and things are a little more achievable — though you'll definitely want 16GB of RAM for Max settings regardless.\nHere are the Max and Ultra PC specifications for The Callisto Protocol. Minimum specifications were not disclosed.\nhttps://twitter.com/CallistoTheGame/status/1598391361044037633?s=20&t=v5ilF8sKoYhQg5NdJfpK4w\nIt should be noted that, with the embargo now clear, some reviewers are complaining of lag, stuttering, and other issues in regard to the PC release. While these are purely testimonial evidence supplied by each individual reviewer, it is a concern that has seemingly cropped up for several pre-launch players. So those planning and popping monster heads on desktop would be wise to do a little investigation before pulling the trigger on the Steam edition.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Here are the beefy PC specifications for The Callisto Protocol appeared first on Destructoid.",

It looks to be a pretty brutal affair.\nThe Like a Dragon: Ishin! trailer focuses specifically on the remaster's combat mechanics, and sees our stoic protagonists engage with an army of samurai, ninja, and mercenary soldiers — utilizing several different fighting styles that all lead to the same result: a lot of blood and a lot of bodies. We see Sakamoto demonstrate four arts in all — Swordsman, Gunman, Wild Dancer, and Brawler — as he battles his way past insurmountable odds on his mission of vengeance.

Fans are invited to join us on the speedway when Disney Speedstorm launches in 2023 on PC and consoles.\"\nFirst revealed in February of this year, Disney Speedstorm is a curious-looking title that will adapt The House of Mouse's huge litany of characters and worlds to the racetrack in rubber-burnin', power-slidin' action. Players will select characters and vehicles based on series such as Monsters Inc., Pirates of the Caribbean, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and other famous franchises before tearing up themed tracks in online and offline play. Given the enormity of the Disney catalog, Gameloft is liking hoping for a long-life title, with new karts, tracks, and racers added over the ensuing seasons.\nDisney Speedstorm is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Disney Speedstorm delay: Themed racer to launch in 2023 (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following on from the recent reveal of two of its main cast members, Kojima has now offered up a selection of mysterious symbols related to the project.\nhttps://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1598512751436890114?s=20&t=9x2KZB_zL0mBfqO8zPsKuQ\nKojima tweeted out a stark black image featuring three unique logo designs, all of which look like the type of emblems one might see on a flag or a company banner. Alongside the image, Kojima wrote a simple message \"Start a new journey\", once again shrouding his studio's next game with intrigue and mystery — as the Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding creator is wont to do.\nWhile we still do not have a title for the new game, we do know that it will star Elle Fanning of The Neon Demon and Maleficent fame, as well as Shioli Kutsuna, who eagle-eyed readers might have spotted in Marvel's R-rated movie Deadpool 2. While there is no telling exactly when Kojima will play his hand and offer up more clarity on the new game, it should be noted that The Game Awards will take place next week — an annual event which Kojima has used frequently as an opportunity to offer updates on his studio's work.\nAin't no time like the present.

The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions will get 4K and 60 FPS support, and PC will receive optimized keyboard and mouse controls. Advanced graphics settings are also coming to PC.\nAcross the board on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, players will be able to turn on special screen filters. These can make the world Black and White, Sepia, Japanese or Warring Lands-style, to add a bit of a different look to the action.\n\nMore Hunters are on the way\nVoice Chat is also being integrated into the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions of the game. And for PlayStation 5 owners, there will be some special adaptive trigger support, letting you really feel the impact of hits through the triggers.\nJust base Monster Hunter Rise is arriving on January 20, while Sunbreak is expected to hit sometime in Spring 2023.\nPreviously, Monster Hunter Rise and its Sunbreak expansion have only been available on PC through Steam and on Nintendo Switch. Now, at least, there are some additional platforms to play on.\nSadly, those platforms aren't going to interlink. Capcom notes that while PS4 and PS5 players can match with each other for multiplayer, Monster Hunter Rise will not support cross-play or cross-save with other platforms.

The event actually took place at the Tokyo Big Site in Odaiba back at the start of October, and featured tournaments for games like Nintendo Switch Sports and Super Smash Bros., as well as a stage performance from comedy duo Yoiko.\nArguably the main event, however, was the Nintendo Live concert, which of course featured the soundtracks of two of its biggest franchises to date. The show started off with a video of Animal Crossing's Isabella welcoming everyone, and introducing DJ KK -- who then appeared on a screen with some other friends from the game. How adorable! KK's set goes on for a good half hour before we get to see some friendly faces from the Splatoon games: Deep Cut.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ETszC6w-mg\nThis is where the show really kicks off in my opinion, because we get a whole live band including two percussionists, a keyboard player, a guitarist, and a bassist, as well as some other musicians who come out and join in the middle of the performance as well. They have amazing energy, and it looks like they're having a ton of fun!\nThe Squid Sisters also make an appearance to join up with Deep Cut for the finale, which makes for a pretty epic conclusion to the whole thing. The stage set up looked amazing as well with all of the lights and LED screens, and the crowd looked like they were having a blast as well as they grooved along with their light sticks.\nAs someone who loves both live music shows and video game music, this Nintendo Live concert is definitely one I wish I could have seen in person. At least now we can watch and rewatch it in perpetuity, right?\nThe post The Animal Crossing x Splatoon Nintendo Live concert is available to watch on YouTube appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, there have never been more questions about the future of the franchise. Because right now, we’re looking at a potential Generation 5 Remake.\nThe mainline Pokemon series has alternated between new entries and remakes of old games since 2013, so it’s easy to see why Pokémon Black & White could return as early as next year. In fact, Unova is specifically referenced in Scarlet & Violet, which further fans the flames of speculation. On one hand, the timing couldn’t be better. While Black & White were divisive in 2010, fans have since warmed to these titles. Many say this is the franchise’s best generation ever, including myself.\nOn the other hand, Black …",

          "description": "The DualSense controller will bring a whole new feel\nThe \"lightning fast\" first person shooter/puzzle platformer Neon White was one of this year's best indie hits. It had some of the freshest gameplay ideas we've seen in a while, plus, who doesn't love a game that pushes you to challenge yourself to beat a level as fast as you can? I could see Neon White being a gateway to the speedrunning community, for sure. The game was able to snag three different nominations from the Game Awards, including Best Indie, Best Action, and Best Debut Indie.\nNow, PlayStation has announced that they're bringing Neon White to PS4 and PS5 consoles on December 13, so a whole new group of players who have yet to check it out are going to have the chance. According to a PlayStation blog by Angel Matrix's Game Director Ben Esposito detailing the port, Neon White will run at 120hz on PlayStation 5 across the board, because \"high framerate matters\" when a game is so focused on speed.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayNeonWhite/status/1598361286680535042\nThe port will also \"make use of PS5's adaptive triggers to make each Soul Card feel unique when you fire them as well as when you discard.\" Another DualSense feature you can use to your advantage is the controller's Gyroscope, which you can use to help aim with more precision. Esposito says \"gyroscope aiming can take some getting used to, but it’s well worth it for an extra degree of fine-grained control when sniping demons from the start of a level.\"\nIf my Breath of the Wild playthroughs have taught me anything, it's that motion controls aren't really my thing. Either way, Neon White is a game I've been itching to play since it came out, and now that it's on my favorite console, it looks like it's finally time for me to give this heavenly speedrunner a shot.\nThe post Neon White comes to PlayStation consoles this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Amnesia: The Bunker is a new entry in the horror series, arriving on PC and consoles in March 2023.\nFrictional showed off a short clip of the new Amnesia today, spotlighting what terror may lurk in its darkest corners. Amnesia: The Bunker is set in a decrepit World War I-era bunker, where something has quite plainly gone wrong.\nThere are horrors that lurk out of sight, and for that, you will have a gun in Amnesia: The Bunker. The problem is, it looks like Frictional's only giving you one bullet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxLSsDmtj-U\nThe mechanical nature of the light and pocketwatch are already two major draws. As someone who loved the tactile feel of tools in games like the Metro series, that's right up my alley.\nAnd a gun might have felt like a strange addition to Amnesia, which is usually more in the run-and-hide realm of horror compared to something like Resident Evil. Yet as we can see in the trailer, and in the description, that gun starts with one bullet. Genius.\n\nA more active Amnesia\nSadly, it does seem like you can craft more weapons and tools to deal with the nightmares of the bunker. (Yes, I was hoping that you'd only have one bullet, for the whole game.)\nAmnesia: The Bunker takes place in a semi-open world, according to Frictional, where you'll need to explore and test things out to find a way out. There's also a dynamic and \"ever-present\" monster that responds to your actions.\nOverall, it feels like Frictional tackling the Alien: Isolation brand of horror, and I'm interested in that. Frictional Games has been putting together horror games for some time, and while combat isn't usually at the forefront of their games, I'm interested to see what they do with it.\nAmnesia: The Bunker arrives in March 2023 for PC and consoles.

In the brief clip, we get to see the kingdom's denizens going about their daily routine, gathering coins from Question Blocks, (which I guess is sort of an ATM in the kingdom), and traveling in style, via the Mario Bros. universe's famous network of warp pipes.\nhttps://twitter.com/SomeKirbyFan/status/1597982078809026560?s=20&t=s6-ZVqNs4I4Wra2KtbgBJg\nThe original clips are being swallowed up by the mighty suits of NBC Universal, but you can check out the alternate preview in the above tweet, courtesy of Twittererer @somekirbyfan. Of course, trailers leave absolutely zero to the imagination these days, so maybe you have already had your fill of previews and wish to simply wait for the film's premiere. Good on you. Whilst I'm really not a fan of Illumination's cookie-cutter, rubber-faced shenanigans, I must admit that the world and characters look absolutely delightful in the trailers so far, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing all of these wonderful characters brought to life. We just need to see Wendy O. and Chain Chomp and I'm good.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in Europe on March 30, North America on April 7, and Japan on April 28, 2023.\nThe post Alternate Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Harvest McDoom\nWhile \"cozy\" games are all the rage on the indie scene these days, perhaps one of the gold standards for relaxing, casual-grind-based gameplay is Natsume's iconic farming series, Harvest Moon — And the franchise seems to have had something of a strange effect on YouTuber Cloudie McDoom, who woke up yesterday morning to find themselves occupying a live-action recreation of the beloved franchise.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pCxPlryaI\nWhilst I won't spoil the work that has gone into this short, but authentic take on Harvest Moon's hard-working world, Cloudie's video raises more than a few smiles thanks to its U.I implementation, use of flailing limbs and stop-start photography to truly capture gaming's classic \"zero-turning-circle\" animation style. The sounds, music, and fade-outs only complete the effect.\nThere are no squawking chickens, fox attacks, or trips to the market, unfortunately, but I dig the real-life recreation of Harvest Moon's \"square-by-square\" gardening techniques. And if you enjoyed the Harvest Moon video, be sure to check out Cloudie McDoom's channel over on YouTube for more parodies and recreations of classic video games.\nThe latest Harvest Moon title, Harvest Moon: One World, is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post YouTube skit recreates an average morning in Harvest Moon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you miss it, you'll have another chance in a few weeks\nAs promised nearly a month ago, Game Freak is opening up the Charizard Tera Raid event in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet later today: at 4PM PT, to be exact. The event will be live through Sunday, December 4, at 3:59PM PT, so you basically have a weekend and change to get it done.\nNote that you will need to do some legwork to actually partake. As Nintendo puts it: \"You’ll be able to take on Tera Raid Battles at black crystals after completing certain postgame events. However, players who haven’t completed these events may still participate in these Tera Raid Battles by joining another Trainer’s Tera Raid Battle, whether they’re in a multiplayer group or using a Link Code.\"\nHere's a full guide on how to actually start that process. There's another proviso too: you can only catch one of these Charizards per save file.\nIf you're not free this weekend, you'll get another shot! The event will also run from December 15 through December 18.\n\nHere are the exact times for the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Charizard Tera Raid:\nThursday, December 1, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. – Sunday, December 4, 2022, at 3:59 p.m. PST\nThursday, December 15, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. – Sunday, December 18, 2022, at 3:59 p.m. PST\nThe post Pokemon Scarlet & Violet’s Charizard Tera Raid event begins today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "All hands on Deck\nValve has announced that, during next week's The Game Awards festivities, it is planning to give away one Steam Deck for every minute of the annual award ceremony. I am resisting the urge to make a \"so that'll be 7000 Steam Decks\" joke. Please bear with me during this difficult time.\nThe rules are simple, yet frightening. Anybody can sign up for the giveaway, providing that they live within the UK, Europe, Canada, or the United States. All entrants must have made a Steam purchase between November 14, 2021 and November 14, 2022 in order to officially confirm their home country. Additionally, your Steam account must be in good standing, and not be limited for bad behavior or any other penalizations.\nThen on December 8, be sure to tune into The Game Awards via the Steam app. All qualifying participants, who are currently watching the ceremony via Steam will be placed into a lottery. Names will be drawn at random on a minute-to-minute basis, with each winner bagging themselves a 512GB Steam Deck. Full terms, conditions, and rules are available over on the official Steam website.\nIf you were planning on watching the show anyway, then this might be a fine way to potentially bag yourself a reward for doing so. We can assume that a helluva lot of people will enter the sweepstakes, and given that The Game Awards 2021 was watched by some six million viewers on Twitch and YouTube alone, there's gonna be more than a few names in the hat. Still, worth a shot, right? Besides, every participant will automatically bag themselves this super cute digital sticker.\nThe Game Awards 2022 takes place Thursday, December 8, at 16:30 PT / 19:30 ET / 00:30 BST.\nThe post 100+ Steam Decks to be given away during The Game Awards 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

This fast-paced, speedrunning FPS is well worth your time if you haven't played it yet and you can find out why in Game Informer's Neon White review. \n\n\n\"Neon White is a lightning fast single-player speedrunning FPS where players sacrifice their guns for godlike parkour moves,\" a press release reads. \"Assume the role of White, an assassin handpicked from Hell, and compete with other demon slayers for a shot at redemption and a chance to live permanently in Heaven. The game utilizes a unique card-based weapon system, bite sized hand-designed levels, and a breakneck soundtrack by Machine Girl to turn players into speedrunning freaks. \n\"As players unravel Heaven's mysteries, they will discover the other demon slayers are more familiar than they first appear, and through the visual novel inspired story, they learn it's never too late to seek forgiveness.\" \nCheck out this new trailer released today for the game's upcoming PlayStation debut: \n\n\nFor more, read this feature about how a Neon White level is made and then find out why it's one of the top 10 games on Switch. \nAre you going to check out Neon White on PlayStation? Let us know in the comments below!",

As for what's available, Capcom lists ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, open tournaments, extreme battle, the game center, and Street Fighter 6's training mode. \n\n\nIf you'd like to sign up to potentially participate in this second closed beta, you can do so here. It's important to note, though, that completing Capcom's application process does not guarantee you selection for the beta. Selection is handled via a lottery system, according to Capcom, and not a first-come, first-served basis. You'll need to have a registered Capcom ID to even apply and it must be linked to your platform account so be sure to do that first thing. Other than that, good luck getting in! The response to the first closed beta for Street Fighter 6 a few weeks ago was quite positive so it sounds like this second beta is going to be a great time as well. \nIn the meantime, be sure to check out Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 cover hub for all kinds of exclusive information and videos about the game.

The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.\nGoodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. \n\n\nKO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. \nGoodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.",

Games Montreal revealed that following the game's launch, four-player co-op, a heavily requested feature by fans, would be added in the form of a new mode called Heroic Assault. That mode, as well as a new two-player mode called Showdown, are both live now in Gotham Knights thanks to a new update. \nThe base campaign of Gotham Knights allows for two-player co-op play, but getting all four of the knights together wasn't possible. That's still the case while playing through the game's story, but the new online cooperative Heroic Assault mode, which tasks players with defeating enemies and completing challenges across 30 floors, supports four-player play. \nYou can get a look at what to expect in the new trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Starro…",

It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to \"please be patient\" because \"it's gonna be a while until we can share more details\" when the company announced this game last month. \nThe Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename \"Hadar.\" \n[Source: VG247]\nAre you excited that The Witcher Remake will be open-world or do you wish it was more like the original?

Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. \nThis news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 \"fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island,\" as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. \n\n\nOther fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. \nWhile waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nHave you been playing Sonic Frontiers?

Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review.

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. \nEven more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…",

According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.\nBut first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen. Read more...",

          "description": "Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo's history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.",

Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.\nThe smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …",

          "description": "A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon \"Emblems,\" characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",
