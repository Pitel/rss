They figured out how to take a beloved series like Super Mario, put a slight twist on it, and create something entirely new that doesn't feel stale, doesn't feel like a flimsy spin-off, and best of all, is better than most Super Mario games. Yeah. It is. Fight me.\nFast forward to today, and Nintendo has really painted itself into a corner with success. Zelda and Mario rule the Nintendo kingdom, with other series like Metroid, Kirby, and Animal Crossing as their princes and princesses. Everyone wants sequels and ports, and who can blame them? I also want to play Wind Waker on the Switch. I also want another Animal Crossing. I also can't wait until Tears of the Kingdom comes out.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It turns out that civilisation, no matter how advanced, will always appreciate a good pratfall, or even something as simple as a human being moving in a way that human beings aren't supposed to. We're all just complicated upright monkeys, at the end of the day.\nAnd so, in honour of the humble-yet-hilarious form of comedy that is slapstick, we've assembled the very finest physical comedy games that the Nintendo Switch has to offer. \"Wacky Physics\" is its own genre of games, usually to do with either intentionally frustrating controls, ragdoll characters that feel like piloting a mech made of jelly, or physics simulation dials turned up to 11.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Remember you will die\".\nThough Persona 3 was actually the fourth mainline release in the series, the meme goes that it was really the first because Atlus just refuses to acknowledge the previous games. As a fresh start for the series, Persona 3 was eventually followed up with not one, but two ‘final’ versions that each had important new features which didn’t appear in the other version. The version that was chosen for the modern remaster was Persona 3 Portable, which originally saw release on the PSP in the late 2000s. Though it certainly feels like an aging portable game, P3P shows that it’s still got it where it counts; despite some drawbacks, this remains an enjoyable and engaging RPG.\nMuch like other releases in the series, P3P follows an ensemble cast of high school characters led by your silent protagonist, who in this case is a transfer student who returns to their hometown ten years after the death of both their parents. Things quickly take a darker turn when you experience the mysterious Dark Hour, a hidden, liminal time just after midnight when a creepy moon shines brightly and all humans briefly turn into standing coffins.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Heartbreak, heartbreak, you tell me goomba\".\nAlthough Shin Megami Tensei is technically the flagship RPG franchise over at Atlus, its spin-off Persona series has made huge strides in finding mainstream appeal in recent years. While Persona 5 may have done most of the heavy lifting, Persona 4 Golden (P4G)—the enhanced re-release of the PS2 classic—was also an instrumental part in getting the series on the map. Part of the benefit of being released on the tragically doomed PS Vita meant that it was that much easier to stand out from the slim crowd of games on the platform, and P4G was quickly lauded as one of the few must-have buys for the platform. After stronger-than-expected sales from its surprise Steam release in 2020, P4G has now found its way to the Switch and we’re pleased to report that it is still a thoroughly delightful RPG.\nP4G places you in the role of a city-dwelling silent protagonist who moves to the rural town of Inaba to live with his uncle and cousin for a year while his parents work abroad. While your character seems to adjust well to his new life, things are tense around town as there’s a serial killer on the loose who’s consistently evading the police. Your character and his newfound friends then quickly get wrapped up in the mystery when they discover the Midnight Channel, a mysterious 'other world' that can be accessed by crawling through a TV screen. The killer is using the Midnight Channel and its abundant population of Shadows to murder his victims, but you soon realize that you can battle Shadows using your Personas and free the victims before it's too late. You and your friends thus set out to save the killer’s victims while also stringing together clues to try and deduce who the killer is.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Here was a game that deepened the relationship and social sim aspects and captured the hearts of gamers who revelled in three separate campaign paths packed full of interactive melodrama that sat perfectly alongside the series' signature strategic action.\nFast forward to 2023 and you'd be forgiven for expecting Fire Emblem Engage to follow closely in the footsteps of its all-conquering predecessor whilst refining combat, smoothing rough edges, and adding even more relationships, more romance, and just generally more of all the aspects that so many people readily connected with last time around. Well, excuse you for being wrong, because this latest Fire Emblem escapade is side-stepping all of that in favour of a different flavour of adventure that harks backs to earlier entries in the franchise. Its focus is set firmly on combat, with everything else taking a firm backseat.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.\r\n\nBay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as \"graphics\" at all.\nI'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the \"classic\" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I've been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress's place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?\nRead more",

A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won't answer any questions you might've had about the ending of Backbone. It's also out very soon, on February 2nd.\nRead more",

(The third camp was \"eh, I might check it out\" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?\nThis was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors.

The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game's open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss's lair. There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.\nI went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression.

It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.\n\n \nRead more",

To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.\r\n\n\r\nSo yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.\nI can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.\nRead more",

Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.\r\n\n\r\n An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive's lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they've been actively \"bad for gaming\". So we thought we'd put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they're actually good way of getting more out of a game?

Now any speaking NPC in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can let rip with a big old Fus Ro Dah and fire you straight into the sky, thanks to the Everyone Is The Dragonborn mod.

So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.\nRead more",

Ty fungují dobře, ale při vyplňování formulářů mají velké problémy s českými znaky. Je to způsobené tím, že samotný standard PDF zná jen základní sady znaků, v kterých znaky české abecedy chybí, vysvětluje Jiří Eischmann na stránkách MojeFedora.cz. Standard sice zná ještě znakovou sadu RTF, ale ta zase není podporovaná všemi klienty.

          "description": "Michael B. Jordan will star\nVideo game adaptations are everywhere these days -- why not throw another one on the pile? We now know there's a Rainbow Six movie coming from Paramount, and it's just been announced that John Wick director Chad Stahelski is attached to the project, as covered by The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive. Actor Michael B. Jordan is also involved, and he'll star as John Clark -- the protagonist of Tom Clancy's famous book series that inspired the games. Jordan's already taken on the role of Clark after starring in the 2021 film Without Remorse which was also based on Clancy's work.\nThis new movie will likely serve as a sequel to Without Remorse, as at the end of the film, Clark is planning to establish the famed multinational anti-terrorist \"Rainbow\" team. While the first film only took inspiration from Clancy's writing, this potential sequel will instead focus on the team that was made so popular by Ubisoft's game series: Rainbow Six. Details are sparse as of now, as the movie does not yet have a release date or plot summary, so keep in mind that it's all pretty much speculation. Even so, it's hard to imagine they'd pass on drawing inspiration from the games at least a little bit, especially for an action movie.\n[caption id=\"attachment_358479\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via Paramount Pictures[/caption]\nChad Stahelski is best known for his directorial debut with the John Wick movies, but he's actually been around the industry for a long time as a stuntman, having worked on films like The Matrix, Van Helsing, and Escape from L.A. Here's hoping that such a prolific figure in the action space will make unique, compelling work of the IP he's drawing on because a lot of fans are hoping to see their favorite series done justice on the silver screen.\nThe post Rainbow Six movie lands John Wick director Chad Stahelski appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The co-op horror shooter is making its way to the Switch\nGunfire Games' Remnant: From the Ashes is making its way to a new platform on the Nintendo Switch. The co-op horror action game is coming to Nintendo's handheld sometime soon.\nThe survival horror-inspired co-op shooter first arrived in 2019, pitting solo players or teams against a horde of monstrosities in a decrepit urban landscape. Now, Gunfire Games is bringing the action to a handheld format, alongside THQ Nordic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuLxV3g6YU\nNo release date has been set yet. A sequel to Remnant, currently dubbed Remnant 2, was revealed at The Game Awards 2022. The new Remnant title is targeting a 2023 launch, and will be headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but no Switch.\nRise from the ashes\nIt's a bit of a surprise, but certainly not an unwelcome one. Remnant: From the Ashes has always been talked up by those I know who have played it, and another platform for the co-op action game certainly seems like a good thing.\nIn our review from the game's launch, it does assert that while Remnant does take a while to get it going, it does eventually let it rip. The randomization offers a bit of variety to each run, and the urban-apocalyptic world is something special altogether, like a mix between Metro and Eldritch horror.\nMaybe the game will find another audience to build up on the Switch, just in time to tee them up for the sequel. We'll keep an eye out for more to come on Remnant: From the Ashes' Switch port, and how soon it will be arriving.\nThe post Remnant: From the Ashes is headed for Nintendo Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Live Service Squad\nIt looks like Warner Bros. and Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League may have some live service features tied into it. A new leak, with details corroborated by VGC, shows mentions of live service features that include a battle pass.\nThe leaked image circulated out from 4chan and Reddit and was soon picked up by news outlet VGC. According to a source VGC spoke to, the image comes from a recent test build and shows menus planned for Rocksteady's next game. Among these elements are a battle pass, store, and currencies, which would imply some live service features could be in the game.\nVGC reports that a development source has said a battle pass is planned, but it would be focused on cosmetic content. The currencies shown also reportedly pertain to XP and skill trees for characters. These characters won't start off weak, according to VGC's source, but will \"start off great and can get ridiculous, like Arkham Knight's Batman.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB48qOGxNlg\nA suicide mission\nWe haven't seen much Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League gameplay yet that could further back this up or not. Most recently, we saw a cinematic tease of the upcoming anti-hero brawler at The Game Awards 2022. Alongside a release date confirmation for May 26, 2023, Rocksteady also confirmed that Kevin Conroy would be the voice of Batman as well. The voice actor, who played Batman in both the Arkham games series and many animated adaptations, including Batman: The Animated Series, died last year.\nThis is Rocksteady's first game since 2015's Arkham Knight, so fans are likely curious about how these systems pan out. If these shots are from an internal test version, things could potentially shift. Hopefully we'll learn more about what's in store for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sometime between now and its May release date.\nThe post Suicide Squad leak appears to show live service features, including a battle pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

Just when we thought the game offered anything players could possibly dream of, they turn around and offer even more possibilities -- which is exactly what Maxis is doing with the release of two mini-DLCs, also known as kits. The Simtimates Collection Kit and the Bathroom Clutter Kit are releasing on January 19 for PC and Mac, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles.\nThe former includes upgrades to the usual set of pajamas that Sims wear, and the collection \"will help any Sim look bold, flirty, & charming in the bedroom with lacey bodysuits, a variety of underwear styles & playful boxer prints.\" Now your Sim can lounge around in style, and of course, the new looks can invite some more spice into your game if you're into that kind of thing.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1615380171607126016\nThe Bathroom Clutter Kit takes a turn into the messy -- this kit allows players to customize their clutter, and scatter various knick-knacks around their bathrooms. The items range from Grandma's dentures to makeup palettes, so you'll be able to create a lived-in space for anybody in your Sims household.\nBoth of these kits were teased in the \"It's All Relative\" Roadmap for The Sims 4 posted on January 12, 2023, which also announced that the game will receive \"one big update\" and an expansion pack on top of the two new kits. In addition, there will also be more support for extended family systems in the game, which will also tie back into the big expansion that's coming this year, according to the Roadmap post. Looks like this is only the beginning of the exciting things the Maxis team has in store, and considering The Sims 4 is now free-to-play, it's an excellent time to jump in and join the fun.\nThe post The Sims 4 is getting some spicy, messy mini-DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

The rumor, though not confirmed, seems snug, as Leatherface will soon be making his hammer blows felt in his very own assymetrical title, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is currently in development at Sumo Digital.\nhttps://twitter.com/LeaksDbd/status/1611429823116677124?s=20&t=PG83dYm-Y8TmQYqsRvoTGg\nScheduled to launch later in 2023, and published by Gun Interactive, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will see players on the run from the terrifying Sawyer family, consisting of The Hitchhiker, The Cook, and, of course, Leatherface himself. As such, one would assume that this title would have the exclusive rights to the saggy-pants psychopath, and would rather he wasn't making an appearance in other games, especially one so immediately similar to its own.\nBehavior Interactive is yet to comment on the rumor, but we'll be sure to update this story once we know the official score.

          "description": "14-year co-publishing deal fails to find extension\nIn late 2022, the Blizzard community received the shocking news that titles such as Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft were to be shuttered in China, following the collapse of a partnership deal between Activision Blizzard and NetEase — New comments from the WoW publisher points to NetEase itself for being the cause of the industry-shaking decision.\nIn a post by Blizzard China, (reported by global news outlet Reuters), the publisher claims that it proposed a six-month extension of its partnership, giving Blizzard a further six months to support its games in China while looking for a new publisher, but this proposal was rejected by NetEase. Reuters also claims that NetEase has already begun the process of disbanding the teams responsible for the marketing and support of Blizzard's titles.\nThere is a definitive element of \"He said, She said\" at play regarding the initial split, as both parties have commented that it was irreconcilable differences with the other that caused the 14-year publishing deal to not receive an extension. Various sources have cited money, data handling, and IP proposals as lynchpins for the failed contract negotiations, with NetEase president Simon Zhu going so far as to refer to an unnamed Activision Blizzard executive as a \"jerk\".\nAs such, eight Activision Blizzard titles will be shuttered in China as of January 23. The affected titles are World of Warcraft, Warcraft III: Reforged, Hearthstone, Diablo III, Diablo: Immortal, StarCraft, Overwatch 2, and Heroes of the Storm. Of course, this motion will also severely impact China's lucrative esports scene, as well as its litany of professional players.\nActivision Blizzard has noted that it is currently seeking a new publishing partner in China. It is assumed that, once a partner is found and a deal finalized, that normal service will return to these eight games.\nThe post Activision Blizzard: NetEase rejected partnership extension proposal appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Update 1.2.0 to the rescue\nJust this past week, Platinum released the first major post-launch update for Bayonetta 3, and it was a doozy. Not only did it address some long-running concerns from the community for a few encounters (and Viola's moveset), but it also directly impacted a really low key aspect of the game: the playable teaser for the upcoming release Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.\nHere's a quick reminder of what that update actually changed:\nGame Modes\nConditions for obtaining the “Tricolored Keys” needed to unseal the “Old Picture Book” have been made easier.\n“Tricolored Keys” will be automatically available on the chapter select screen once it becomes possible to access the “Gates of Hell”.\nEven if the player already has access to the Gates of Hell, or has already obtained one or two keys, they will automatically obtain the remaining keys when going to the chapter select screen after applying the update.\nAccessing the Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon demo is much easier in 2023\nAs the Nintendo of Europe Twitter account pointed out this weekend, once you have the new update (1.2.0) installed, you can just buy the Old Picture Book from the Gates of Hell shop: no keys or added steps needed! Prior to the update, after buying the book, you needed to locate three hidden keys spread across several chapters of the game (Chapter 1, 4, and 13).\nThis takes me back to the bygone era where demos were king, and sometimes were selling points all on their own. While the Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon itself is very brief, it's cool to see more free unlockables in games, sans DLC. The action genre is the perfect host for it.\nThe post PSA: A new update made it a lot easier to play the hidden Bayonetta 3 demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

While Microsoft will be able to make suggestions to placate the bodies, the whole process has already turned bitter at points, helping matters none.\nThe commission declined to respond to Reuters report, though a Microsoft representative said of the story: \"We're continuing to work with the European Commission to address any marketplace concerns. Our goal is to bring more games to more people, and this deal will further that goal.\"\nThe comment pursues Microsoft's line that it is not seeking to form a monopoly with the purchase of Activision Blizzard, a dogged mantra that it is following in the face of concerns that billion-dollar franchises such as Call of Duty may become Xbox exclusives at some point in the future. Microsoft's attempts to assuage these concerns have been relatively futile as of late.\nThe Microsoft/FTC lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial this summer, with both parties free to appeal whatever the outcome. Microsoft will then have to placate the EU Commission and other bodies in similar fashion, which makes the Activision Blizzard purchase — a deal that I cannot see MS backing away from — a long, long time in the making.\nMicrosoft faces EU antitrust warning over Activision deal [Reuters]\nThe post EU reportedly set to reject Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard purchase appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's sad to see this young spatial puzzle game, not even old enough to drink, snuffed out so soon.\nIn all seriousness, Killer Puzzle is as loving a tribute to the slasher franchise as you could ask for. For the most part, it follows the rules of the film series (Jason can just appear behind anyone he sees, is weak against drowning, etc), and features just about every iteration of the hockey-masked horror icon as you could ask for (including his green and purple look from the infamous NES title).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Ylirqs8To&ab_channel=BlueWizardDigital\nSo if you want to get this slice of the life (and afterlife) of one of the most loved and feared fictional serial killers in history, you'll have to act fast. Due to an inability to renew the license, this particular Friday the 13th game and all of its DLC are being removed from all available storefronts ( So that's Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo eShop, Xbox Store, and Playstation Store) on January 23.\nThe only encouraging thing about this turn of events is that Killer Puzzle was itself a retooling of an original title called Slayaway Camp that will be available indefinitely. So while this specific game in the horror-puzzle formula subgenre may be sinking into the depths of history forever, there's a chance that it may come back to the dead someday, maybe with a whole new outward-facing look.\nMaybe the Killer Klowns are looking for more work?\nThe post Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle gets slashed for good on January 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The player can rotate the tank through a 360-degree landscape, utilizing radar to locate the attackers. Senjyo was highly praised in its day for using parallax scrolling and forced perspective to give the illusion of 3D visuals, though some players were frustrated by the sluggish movement of the tank itself.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2HUVMa8vQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming\nSenjyo would head to western arcades in 1984, arriving just in time for the market crash. Undaunted, developer Tehkan would eventually return with several sizeable hits for the home and arcade market, eventually changes its name to the more localization-friendly \"Tecmo\". As I'm sure nobody needs reminding, Tecmo would merge with Koei in 2009 to form Koei Tecmo, which is today best known for franchises such as Dead or Alive, Dynasty Warriors, Monster Rancher, and Fatal Frame.\nSenjyo is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Experience Tecmo’s formative years with Arcade Archives’ Senjyo appeared first on Destructoid.",

I hope that your year has gotten off to a fine start and that this is a really happy and prosperous weekend for you. My weekend, unfortunately, will be spent with my arch-enemy, Maths. It is January, and that means that the tax office is breathing down my neck even though I paid it last year. How much money do they want? The answer is all of it. Still, this is why the trains run on time, there are fleets of fire engines on our streets, and our beloved, devoted NHS service is fully funded — with all its workers fairly compensated...

          "description": "What is it they say about sunk cost again?\nAt this point, I don't know where to start with Beyond Good & Evil 2. It holds the record for the game with the most time in development, and has become the poster child for development hell. Seeing as Ubisoft just announced a whole host of game delays and cancellations, I thought for sure the long-awaited sequel would be on that list.\nMuch to fans' relief, however, Ubisoft has just confirmed that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still very much alive and well in a conversation with PCGamesN. The game's development is still \"underway and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise,\" an unspecified Ubisoft spokesperson disclosed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9VPnI34dPw\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 was announced all the way back in 2009, but got its first trailer nearly a decade later at E3 in 2017, as well as a cinematic trailer the following year at the same event. The original is a cult classic that came out in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows, and even if the sequel dropped tomorrow, it would be crazy to think it skipped three whole console generations. If I had to put money on it, I'd bet it'll skip at least for by the time it eventually releases — optimistically assuming that it ever will at all.\nThe post Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still on the way despite Ubisoft cancellations appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Let's roll\nKatamari Damacy is one of those games that you don't hear about a lot these days, and yet somehow everyone seems to have played it at some point in their lives. The premise is simple, but it's so engaging that it'll keep us coming back for more every time. Just when I thought it was impossible to improve on the tried-and-true Katamari formula, a modder came along and proved me wrong in the best way.\nOriginally spotted by Time Extension, computer scientist and custom controller enthusiast Dr. Tom Tilley created a \"super cheap\" controller setup to roll his way through the game using some empty roll-on deodorant packaging, some cardboard, a computer mouse, and a soccer ball, or football for the non-Americans. Tilley rigged the setup work with an emulated PS2 version of Katamari Damacy, and the video he posted on YouTube makes me wish I had a version of it myself.\nhttps://youtu.be/PHPJ2wTBJlo\nA roller-ball is the way to go with this game, which is evidenced by the fact that Tilley wasn't the first one to build a similar prototype -- back in 2014, a YouTuber by the name of Siage uploaded a video of another prototype for a custom Katamari controller. I think this one might actually be my favorite seeing as it swaps out the soccer ball for one plastered with the faces of Disney princesses.\nI can't see a future where mass production for such controllers would make any sense, but I'd love to see some full-scale implementations in the form of some Katamari Damacy arcade machines. I want 2023 to be the year that we bring both arcades and Katamari back into the limelight of public consciousness, and then combine them together to achieve my new life's goal -- playing this game with a roller-ball controller.\nThe post This custom Katamari controller is the only way I want to play the game from now on appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.\nThere's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. Starting today, you can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown tomorrow.

Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail.

We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.\" \n\"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,\" Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. \"We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.\" \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Deadline]",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?
