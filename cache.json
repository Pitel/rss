          "description": "\"Are you tiny Thor, god of tiny hammers?\".\nTiny Thor from Asylum Square has been a long time coming. After one of its lead developers came up with a rough cut of its concept in a 48-hour game jam in 2012, its development proceeded in fits and starts for a little over a decade before it finally saw release this past June. Games that spend that long in development hell can be notoriously uneven, but we’re happy to report that Tiny Thor has proven to be worth the wait. This is a tough, gorgeous, and altogether great retro platformer that you ought to consider picking up.\nThe 16-bit-inspired game follows the adventures of the titular Asgardian warrior during a time long before he was the buff, long-haired hero you all know—the story here opens on his eighth birthday. As a present, Odin gifts him the legendary Mjolnir hammer, which Thor immediately takes to. While he’s out fooling around with his new toy, the boy is approached by a certain mischievous individual, who tricks him into destroying the anchor of the Bifrost, cutting off all of Asgard from Midgard. Joined by his father’s ravens, Tiny Thor thus sets out to repair the damage and prevent Ragnarök from causing the end of the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "And Nintendo reconfirms its interest in future films.\nThe most recent Nintendo financial report is packed full of sales figures for games and consoles alike, but let's not forget that the Big-N is now in the world of films too. On a note about expanding the company's IP, the report revealed the viewing numbers from The Super Mario Bros. Movie's box office which is estimated (by Universal Pictures) to have pulled in a whopping 168.10 million viewers.\nThis will likely come as no surprise. The Mario Movie was breaking records straight out of the gate, quickly becoming the highest-grossing video game adaptation after just one week. It has since gone on to become one of the biggest animated movies of all time with a box office taking of $1.349 billion, according to the report — Nintendo describes this as \"the second-highest for an animated film\" though figures from Box Office Mojo place the 2019's The Lion King and Frozen 2 above it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's unlikely that we will ever see that series on Switch, but it looks like we will soon have its spiritual successor as the development team has opened up funding for their next project, Ratatan, which has now passed its console stretch goal.\nMuch like the team's former series, Ratatan is a rhythm-based side-scrolling adventure game where you will take command of an adorable army and send them out against oncoming foes by keeping to the pulsating beat. The Ratatan leaders each possess different skills, so you will have to combine the toe-tapping rhythm controls with a level of tactical thinking to make the most of each run and sacrifice as few troops as possible.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.\nRead more",

          "description": "Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. \nThere are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation. \nRead more",

          "description": "\"We don't go to Ravenholm…\" Half-Life 2's sixth chapter heading warns, and when you arrive at the outskirts of this abandoned mining town, you immediately see why. This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. \nBut I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: \"We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun.\" This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be. \nRead more",

It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. \nThronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level. \nRead more",

I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. \nThat's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor. \n\nGet the LG 27GR95QE 27-inch 240Hz 1440p OLED gaming monitor for $718 w/ code SAVE4SCHOOL (was $999)\n\nRead more",

It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.\nRead more",

          "description": "I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, \"Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.\nIt was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you'd also be totally and utterly wrong. \nRead more",

Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.\nI think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present.

          "description": "The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.\nThe Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show. \nRead more",

That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites \"tie into\" its RPG systems. Yep, you can choose to either embrace or resist the tempting corruption, with the former giving you some pretty cool party tricks, while the latter means you won’t be subjected to David Cronenberg-esque body horror. Tough decision, I think.\nRead more",

I'm not built for rain or snow or sunshine either, to be fair - and if you're like me you could maybe have a crack at Wood And Weather's free demo on Steam this weekend, a game where you can change the weather to whatever you want. It's very sweet. I like games where it's like you're smashing lovely toys together. I've already played that, though, I'm telling you that maybe you'll like it.

          "description": "Grinding Gear Games debuted a lovely big chunk of Path Of Exile 2 this evening, taking us through a section of Act 3 of its campaign and showing off two of its six new character classes: the Monk and the Sorceress. With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.\nRead more",

It's loud and bright without being obnoxious or overwhelming, fast and precise without being overly demanding, and generally just a damn good effort at creating a modern action platformer whose main influence is obvious, but isn't just going through the motions for the sake of nostalgia.

Keeping with the event’s spirit of showcasing independent talent and undiscovered gems, I’ve chosen to pick out some of the smaller games peppering the show floor and highlight just a few favourites. \nRead more",

Whether or not Doom 3’s shotgun is one of the good ones (it is).  \r\n\n\r\nIf there’s one area where all of the remake’s ideas truly come together and shine, it’s in the weapons. There wasn’t much to see in the original - nothing beyond the tip of a barrel. Here, the weapons are very much the star of the show. Heavy, industrial things covered in thumb-print smeared LCD screens and superfluous greeblies. NERF guns that've been painted by a 12-year-old and covered in spaceship parts. These are the toy guns you would have wanted for Christmas, and I wanted to know more about them.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ideally, the story of Remnant II’s launch would start and end with it being an ambitious success of a shooty Soulslike. Sadly not: in a Reddit post addressing complaints of wonky performance, even on higher-end graphics cards, developers Gunfire Games admitted to having \"designed the game with upscaling in mind.\" \nWorking the likes of Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS into a game wouldn’t normally be a cause of incredulity. Indeed, as optional performance boosters, they’re pretty much always a welcome sight amid the duller texture filtering and ambient occlusion toggles of the average settings menu. The problem here is that with its dismal performance at native, non-upscaled resolutions, Remnant II essentially forgets about the 'optional' part – and in doing so, undermines what makes DLSS and its rivals such valuable tools in the first place.\nRead more",

          "description": "Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.\r\n\n\r\n“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.\r\n\n\r\n“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”\r\n \nRead more",

In real life, I write to you today from a desk covered in a weird detritus of work and life that wouldn't quite see me on an exploitative reality TV show with the word hoarder somewhere in the title, but, you know... maybe give it 15 years.\nBut I bloody love tidying things in games. Getting everything in the right place. And something that makes it extra enjoyable in Unpacking is the sound design. The house itself is quiet, but everything in the game makes a little noise when you put it away or hang it up or slide it in a shelf, and it's all stuff you recognise from home. It makes the whole experience feel domestic and familiar.\nRead more",

The developers at Singularity 6 invited me to jump in and take a look at Palia ahead of its closed beta launch today. Excited for the opportunity to make some friends and go fishing, I pounced on the offer.\nAfter a few days of casually exploring and immersing myself in the world of Palia, I've come to the following conclusion: Palia is exactly what it advertises it is.

          "description": "Released on April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has been a success for Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment, earning both critical and commercial acclaim. Although it originally skipped the last-gen consoles, the EA first-quarter earnings call revealed that Respawn has PS4 and Xbox One ports on the way for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As the released EA report brief reveals, the company is looking to continue capitalizing on its financially well-performing franchises, including Star Wars Jedi.\n[caption id=\"attachment_375326\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nEA is not done with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor yet\nAs reported by The Verge, EA CEO Andrew Wilson announced during the earnings call that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will come to PS4 and Xbox One, though a release date wasn't mentioned. This is an unexpected turn of events, as in an interview with PLAY Magazine (as reported by Game Rant) game director Stig Asmussen had previously stated that Jedi: Survivor was skipping last-gen consoles to ensure a \"true new-gen experience in the Star Wars universe.\"\nThe financial report points to Star Wars Jedi and FIFA as the catalysts for its first-quarter performance. It highlights that in addition to attracting millions of players globally, Jedi: Survivor is also “seeing players spend more time in-game than its predecessor.” FIFA was noted for “delivering a record Q1 for the franchise,” and this comes as the series undergoes massive rebranding following the end of EA’s partnership with FIFA. The next entry in the series will be titled EA Sports FC 24.\nRespawn has continually been working on the game since its launch, with patches being released to improve performance on all gaming platforms. Time will tell how developers will manage to ensure smooth performance on the dated last-gen consoles.\nThe post EA is working on PS4 and Xbox One version of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor appeared first on Destructoid.",

To the dismay of the developers, some gamers have since cracked the CNT to play it in unintended ways. Bandai Namco is warning players against playing Tekken 8's cracked CNT, and those caught could face consequences.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392950\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nBe patient or risk a ban\nPlayers with the cracked CNT can not only play the game offline, but continue to play it beyond the test period. In a Twitter post, Bandai Namco warned that this violates its Terms of Service and the Tekken World Tour's Code of Conduct.\nhttps://twitter.com/BNEesports/status/1685978121948770305\nUnauthorized access to the CNT could result in a ban from the upcoming Tekken World Tour and other official tournaments. In other words, competitive players may want to heed this warning. It is understandable why developers would emphasis this penalty in particular. Those playing the cracked version would have a headstart on practice, which could affect the results of official tournaments.\nThis isn't the only problem the CNT has caused, as it has also resulted in Tekken 8's partial roster leaking. Though Bandai Namco has officially announced 16 characters, the leak reveals a longer list of playable fighters.\nIt has certainly been a good time for fighting game fans. Street Fighter 6 launched to critical acclaim in June, and Mortal Kombat 1 will launch on September 19.

          "description": "Crawly Games has announced that their deckbuilder horror game, Draft of Darkness, is leaving Steam Early Access and going full version on August 23, 2023.\nIf you’ve never heard of Draft of Darkness, just look at it. It’s like if Pit-Fighter had a personality beyond just “oiled beef.” It has grainy, digitized actors fighting with grainy, unspeakable horrors in rusty lo-fi locales. It has just the right mixture of goofy and sleaze that makes it seem like a lost PS1 game from the creators of Chiller. Ugh, I suddenly have the urge to play Loaded.\nhttps://youtu.be/9sZE1xr7wvI\nDraft of Darkness was actually billed to me as Slay the Spire meets Resident Evil. It’s an ammo-focused turn-based deckbuilder where you recruit survivors and battle monsters and government robots. It uses a roguelite system. Maps are procedurally generated, and you keep advancing until you’re overwhelmed by the darkness. You gain credits that can buy booster packs after each run, allowing you to build up your arsenal over time.\nIt also has a “meta-story progression system.” They say, “Every decision can alter the story's outcome and allow for new ways to progress. Different choices are available in each run, but be careful; some will have serious consequences.”\nI’ve recently had some success when it comes to clicking with deckbuilders recently, and this looks right up my alley. I mean, 90% of that statement comes from just looking at the visuals. It’s like pixelated poetry to me.\nDraft of Darkness is available right now for PC on Steam Early Access. The full version 1.0 will hit on August 23, 2023.\nThe post Draft of Darkness makes its escape from Early Access August 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Through this, owners of Starfield will be able to swap between Xbox Series X|S and PC, without having to buy copies of the game for both systems.\nThat update was noticed by the Starfield Beyond Twitter account, a profile that (as the name heavily implies) chronicles all things related to Bethesda's upcoming space epic. The Starfield store page does currently have the tag.\nhttps://twitter.com/starfieldbeyond/status/1686137526010908673?\nTo infinity, and – wait, wrong franchise\nFor those who don't know, Play Anywhere lets you own a game on Xbox and Windows-based PCs at no additional cost. This also means your saves will carry over between systems, so you could literally start playing on one and smoothly transition to the other without any fuss.\nWith Starfield offering the Xbox Play Anywhere feature, it pretty much means you can have two copies of the game with one purchase. Maybe not everyone will benefit from being able to switch playing \"Skyrim in space\" between console and PC, but it's a neat little bonus if you're into that sort of thing.\nI think it's safe to say we're pretty much ready for Starfield now. We've had everything from the game's PC specs to a 1,000-page compendium outlining as much info as possible. Seems like all that's left is for the game to launch. And it's not far off either. Starfield will touch down on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 6, 2023.\nThe post You’ll only need one copy of Starfield to play on either Xbox or PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is getting a limited Collector's Edition. A post over on THQ's website says there's only going to be 5,000 of these made worldwide, so you might want to get in quick if you want one.\nThe Collector's Edition will feature a fair amount of bonus material, including both a statue and miniature, a steelbook case for the game, some DLC (which includes the Derceto 1992 costume pack), and more. You can check out the trailer for this special edition below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2L3LPpu9I\nReturn to the dark\nWe all know that Resident Evil is one of the most influential survival horror series of all time. However, Alone in the Dark actually predates Capcom's legendary franchise by four years.\nThe first Alone in the Dark game set the scene for the genre and while it's massively dated now, it's been cemented in gaming history as a landmark part of horror. Sadly, subsequent releases and attempts at reboots haven't had much of an impact, being overshadowed by other games that have come after it.\nHowever, Alone in the Dark is making another comeback. A recent video uploaded to publisher THQ Nordic's YouTube page gives a brief teaser of the upcoming title, which is being developed by Magicka 2 studio Pieces Interactive.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtrvT7aDL1s\nWhile previous attempts at bringing Alone in the Dark into the modern world have not gone down well, horror fans will still be looking forward to this entry.\nWith Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and Stranger Things' David Harbour on board (not to mention a story crafted by Amnesia and SOMA writer Mikael Hedberg), there's enough intrigue here to hopefully give the iconic horror series another crack at video game modernity.\nAlone in the Dark is due for release on October 25, and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Alone in the Dark Collector’s Edition announced, along with a creepy teaser appeared first on Destructoid.",

We've already seen Behaviour Interactive's asymmetrical survival game crossover with franchises like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. We've also recently been treated to Nicolas Cage, so anything's possible with this game. Now, it's the Alien franchise's turn to get the Dead by Daylight collaboration treatment.\nA recent teaser over on the official YouTube channel shows that the Xenomorph will be coming to Dead by Daylight. No date on when this will actually be happening has been announced, but the short clip says we can \"learn more on August 8.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/8h6BLFUkbeM\nSuffice it to say, if you're a fan of Dead by Daylight and of the Alien films (or at least two of them), then this update is going to be right up your dark and dingy corridor.\nIn space, no one can hear you crank a generator\nSince releasing in 2016, Dead by Daylight has become a force to be reckoned with in the horror community. If you haven't had a chance to play it, essentially the game involves four players trying to survive against one player who takes on the role of the killer on a murderous rampage.\nSome notable villains and survivors from the world of horror have been implemented over the years, including Ghost Face from the Scream franchise, Evil Dead's Ash, and even the creepy girl from The Ring.\nThe game became so popular that a Dead by Daylight movie adaptation is currently in the pipeline from famed production company Blumhouse. We all know that video games being translated to the big screen isn't always the best move.\nHowever, it could be interesting to see how a co-operative multiplayer game featuring a ton of classic horror monsters will work on film. And, of course, there's the aforementioned Alien crossover to look forward to as well.\nThe post Dead by Daylight is getting an Alien collaboration appeared first on Destructoid.",

The tough co-op shooter wears its FromSoftware influence on its sleeve, which has resonated with fans and critics alike. The developers have revealed that Remnant 2 has already sold over a million copies, exceeding the first game's launch sales by a considerable amount.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394243\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nRemnant 2 soars to the top of the charts\nWhen Remnant: From the Ashes hit shelves in 2019, it took two months before it sold over a million copies. As Gunfire Games has announced, the sequel achieved this feat in just four days. Yoon Im of Gearbox Publishing stated that \"Remnant 2 exceeded our expectations. As a commercial and critical hit, we’re incredibly proud of the Gunfire team and everyone here at Gearbox Publishing who brought this title to life.\"\nThere were early signs that Remnant 2 was gearing up for an explosive launch. Before its release, it had claimed the top spot on Steam's best-seller list, overtaking trending titles like Starfield and BattleBit Remastered. It currently sits in third place, surpassed only by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Baldur's Gate 3. When it was finally released, it doubled the number of concurrent players its predecessor had at launch.\nThe high sales numbers have been accompanied by plenty of critical acclaim, with our own Steven Mills scoring it an impressive 8.5.

However, they did go on to say, “I would like to continue to express myself in-game music through various genres of music. I hope you will look forward to my music in the future!” So, whether or not they return for the next Souls-like FromSoftware title, it sounds like they plan to remain in the games industry, just not under FromSoftware's umbrella.\nIt still hasn’t been said if Kitamura will be doing the soundtrack for the upcoming Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC or Armored Core 6.

          "description": "Look, we all want a third installment in Valve's iconic Half-Life series. But the sad truth is, it's almost certainly never going to happen. As such, we're stuck with the first two (as well as the VR game Alyx). But that's a good thing, because Half-Life 1 and 2 are exemplary first-person shooters. So loved is the series, that fans continue to tweak and mod Half-Life and Half-Life 2 to their own ends.\nTake Team Vestige over on ModDB (via PCGamesN), which has taken the legendary sci-fi FPS and turned it into a horror experience. Called \"Disrepair,\" this mod for Half-Life 2 sees the player slip into the hazard suit of a Combine worker who's been sent to investigate and photograph the radioactive anomalies that have cropped up around the Black Mesa facility.\nhttps://youtu.be/QX-DsNWBp6g\nWhat ensues is a short but creepy experience, not too dissimilar to the likes of Slender: The Eight Pages. The player is tasked with photographing several pieces of artifacts around the infected building, while ominous sounds drill into their ears. It also has a slight SCP vibe about it, in that internet-urban-myth kind of way. You can see YouTube user Farawaygaming diving into \"Despair\" above.\nTake that, Ravenholm!\nWhen you think of Half-Life, you probably don't think of the word \"horror.\" While the games do have their more unsettling moments (the Ravenholm section in HL2 springs to mind), it's not a franchise known for scares.\nThat's why this Half-Life 2 mod, and others like it, are so interesting. They take something that has a very distinctive aesthetic about it and turn it into something that's fairly unsettling. With the tunnel vision-style lighting, black and white graphics, and the eerie tones of this darker side of Black Mesa, Team Vestige is just one of many reasons people keep returning to the Half-Life games after all these years.\nThe post Slenderman meets SCP in this Half-Life 2 horror mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

With that date fast approaching, they’ve released a new trailer highlighting all the features of it.\nhttps://youtu.be/EHwI-4IxivY\nI kept getting The Sims in the post-apocalypse vibes from the trailer, and then the hot tub showed up and cemented it. And then I kept watching and thinking, like, “Oh no, this is nothing like The Sims,” but then I just realized that it’s a lot like post-apocalypse The Sims if you took away all the other Sims and let them travel around scavenging.\nSo, in I Am Future, you play as Chris, potentially the only human left on Earth. And they seem kind of all right with that. I don’t blame them. Their goal is not only to survive but also to search for other survivors and try to unravel the mystery of why the world ended. You explore the sunken city, tear things apart for building materials, and build up your base of operations. You can even build robots to help you with all your chores.\nI Am Future is launching into Early Access with “a part” of the main story. The goal for the team is to add new features, areas to explore, and story content over time. They state that they don’t want to keep it “in Early Access for too long,” but are unwilling to give a more detailed estimate on how long they expect it to last.\nI Am Future launches into Steam Early Access on August 8.

Created by developers One or Eight (Lost Epic), WSS Playground (Needy Streamer Overload), and Alliance Art themselves, it’s a strange twist on a turn-based strategy and is coming to PC in 2024.\nYou play as Duchess Scarlet, who is sentenced to execution for regicide. Head still connected to her shoulders, she escapes with the help of Lily. She’s turned into a prototypical streamer with the ability to incite people into acting out. She uses her newfound powers to capture enemy commanders and intends to “break” the world.\nhttps://youtu.be/C_OfKwzdSSA\nIt looks like things are still rather early in development, but the aesthetic seems to be in place and looks great. 2D characters have an ornate anime look to them, and the 3D world has a voxel appearance. The world, with its heavy depth-of-field blur, reminds me of 3D Dot Game Heroes. It’s just very bright and colorful.\nThere’s also some flirtation going on between Lily and Scarlet, so I’m down for that. I’m not sure about the gameplay. The combat is shown, but I can’t grok the mechanics. It kind of reminds me of that Mii samurai game on 3DS, Warriors Way.

However, Larian Studios has stated that the game won't support preloading ahead of its launch. If you've pre-ordered the game and want to jump in as soon as possible, prepare to set aside some time to download this hefty title.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393716\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Larian Studios.[/caption]\nBaldur's Gate 3's release date draws nearer\nBaldur's Gate 3 will arrive on PC on August 3 at 5 PM CEST, and PS5 on September 6. An Xbox Series X/S port is also in development, although it has yet to receive a release date. Like other titles in the series, players will be able to create their own characters and partake in a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired campaign.\nIn a community update on Steam, the developers confirmed that preloading is off the table for Baldur's Gate 3. In other words, players can't install the game ahead of its release. This would have been useful for a game like Baldur's Gate 3 which will weigh approximately 122 GB.\nThere are a few other things Baldur's Gate 3 fans should know about. Though the game has been available in Early Access, progress made here will not transfer to the final game. Nevertheless, the game will feature cross-save capabilities, allowing you to begin your adventure on PC and continue on PS5 later if you wish.\nIt fortunately appears that making the game easily accessible is a priority for the developers. Those who purchase Baldur's Gate 3 for PC will receive access to both the Mac and Windows versions, though the Mac version will arrive at a later date. Larian Studios also wants the game Steam Deck Verified by launch, as it is already optimized for the handheld.\nWith the game's large size, players may have to wait a bit at launch before they can dive in. However, the Early Access version should give you a good idea of what to expect.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 won’t have a preload, Larian confirms appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bomb Rush Cyberfunk's sleek cel-shaded, Dreamcast-esque graphics are just the start. Team Reptile wants to bring the whole shebang together with music from Hideki Naganuma, the man behind the original. Now, their latest trailer shows a whole lot of what's to come, and for more platforms.\nBomb Rush Cyberfunk was already locked in for Nintendo Switch and PC, but Team Reptile has confirmed it will also launch on Xbox and PlayStation, albeit a little later. Xbox and PlayStation owners will be able to check out the Jet Set successor on September 1, a few weeks after its August 18 release for PC and Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HKDfO51Ja4\nThe Latest Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Trailer\nThe trailer still keeps the mystery of what's going on in the game, as Team Reptile has been very tight-lipped about what Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is going to actually be about. However, the latest trailer teases a bit more. For one, much like it's spiritual predecessor, players will have the choice of choosing between multiple characters. There also styles including BMX, skating, and skateboarding.\nWe also get a look at some drone enemies, which may take the antagonistic role, like the Tokyo-to Police in JSR. There's also a strange monochromatic environment. Although what it means is still up in the air.\nAlongside all there, there are other gangs, antagonistic presences, and many other forces at work in the city. None of it's clear just yet, but we'll probably find out more at launch. There's also another excellent track in the trailer, \"Operator\" by GRRL.\nThe truth will be revealed when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk releases on September 1st for Playstation, Xbox, and PC, and August 18 for Nintendo Switch\nThe post Bomb Rush Cyberfunk locks in Xbox and PlayStation launch for September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Revealed this year, the processors are used in several gaming machines including the Razer Blade 14 (2023), Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, and Acer Nitro 16.\nNone of the reports have been confirmed by Lenovo, though if true, this won't be the company's first foray into the handheld gaming market. An Android-based cloud gaming device called the Legion Play was never officially released, though a few prototype units went on sale in China.\nThe Go would expand the Legion range of gaming PCs which includes laptops such as 2023's Lenovo Legion Pro 5 Gen 8.

Naoum made every single aspect of The Master's Pupil old-school style before using a high-resolution film negative scanner to bring his beautiful artwork into the game's world.\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@patnaoumgames/video/7257654317488819458\nBut what's the game even like?\nThe Master's Pupil is a 12-level 2D sidescroller. It invites players to go on a puzzle-solving adventure that accompanies some of the most important moments in the life of Claude Monet, the 19th-century French impressionist painter whose works informed the game.\nDon't let yourself get fooled by all the beauty, though. Great sadness lives underneath. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that players will have to suffer through the loss of someone very dear to Monet. They will also experience his fight against sight ailments that nearly took away his ability to create art in the way that he loved.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394527\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image by Pat Naoum[/caption]\nAt certain points in the game, the entire level will transform to reveal a Monet painting. The way that the various layers come together to form paintings feels reminiscent of Braid, but the art on display here is on a whole other level. Even if it doesn't seem like your kind of game, you should consider giving it a try. The Master's Pupil feels like one of those one-of-a-kind experiences that you soon won't forget.\nThe Master's Pupil is available on PC and Mac via Steam.

According to a new report from VGC, the successor to the Switch is likely to release in the second half of 2024.\nIn the report, several key partners to Nintendo have claimed to have received development kits for the new console. Development kits for consoles are typically sent out well before the retail release so developers learn the new hardware and ensure some titles are ready to launch on the new platform.\nThe sources went on to share some alleged details on the new system. Like the Nintendo Switch, the next-gen console will have portable mode.

          "description": "If you thought the Skyrim community was done with modding, think again. There are countless ways to tinker with Bethesda's epic fantasy RPG, especially if you play the game on PC. Now, for those who want to see dinosaurs roaming this cold slice of Tamriel, there's a mod that could be right up your alley.\nOver on Nexus Mods, user Birbwalker21 (who's done numerous dinosaur-themed mods in the past) brings us \"Raptors\" for the special edition of Skyrim. As the name implies, this particular download fills the world of Tamriel with a bunch of different raptors for that dose of prehistoric role-playing.\nhttps://youtu.be/0gJxi5xWUK4\nIt's interesting to note that these particular dinosaurs have been given feathers, which research has shown is what the real beasts would have had, as opposed to the scaly creatures seen in popular culture.\nDr. Alan Grant, if he was a Dragonborn\nIt's not just one raptor, either. Birbwalker21 has added three different types of raptors to Skyrim. The first one (called the Forest Raptor) is based on the Velociraptor, which many of you will know from Jurassic Park. These can be identified by their black and orange feathers and are typically found in woodland areas.\nNext is the Alpine Raptor, designed after the Deinonychus. This is a larger raptor you'll come across in the higher and more northerly areas of Tamriel. They sport blue feathers with white crests.\nThen there's the Plains Raptor, which is based on the larger still Utahraptor. They're said to be the fiercest of the bunch when encountered in Skyrim. You can spot them through their brown feathers, but you may want to give them a wide berth, given their aggressive nature.\nIt's great to see new things still being added to this 11-year-old game. Who knows what the Dragonborn will encounter next? Dragons, perhaps? Or is that too farfetched?\nThe post Skyrim meets Jurassic Park in this raptor-themed mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ah, Half-Life 2. For many, Valve's follow-up to the influential 1998 FPS is the developer's magnum opus. It still holds up today and is often held aloft as one of the greatest shooters of all time. Much of it comes down to its tight combat, intriguing story, and dystopian setting.\nBut what was life like for the people of City 17 before the Combine came and wrecked everything? Before the famed Seven-Hour War would see humanity become enslaved? Well, that's what YouTuber Radiation Hazard wondered. In a recent video of theirs (and using beta footage from the game), they showed what Half-Life 2 looked like long before Gordon Freeman came into the picture.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_KQ725AAI\nThe result is what you would expect. With no war and no Combine, the city and its surroundings are as they should be. No damaged structures. No wreckage. No enslaved humans.\nMaybe we'll go to Ravenholm now\nEven Ravenholm (where the game turns into a horror experience) looks positively tranquil before everything went to shit. True, Radiation Hazard's video only shows the mining town in the daylight, but it's still a stark contrast to see this abandoned and dilapidated locale actually looking habitable.\nHowever, it still feels a little bit...eerie. Maybe it's the fact that Half-Life 2's setting is largely industrial, including almost brutalist buildings, or the fact that even in a non-Combine inhabited city, there are still no people milling about, but it still looks quite oppressive.\nIt kind of shows Valve's skills in being able to invoke a mood. Even without the carnage, corpses, and graffiti, Half-Life 2 still looks like a place that one probably wouldn't want to visit. Which makes sense. The game probably wouldn't feel right if Freeman had to defend an idyllic fishing village from the Combine.\nThe post Half-Life 2 before the Combine showed up looks strangely eerie appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). \nJokes on you, real key art here.\npic.twitter.com/UCCexH7IMr\nAugust 2, 2023\nAs you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. \nIn the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. \n\n\n“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. \nFallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” \nWhile waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy.

Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. \nWhile its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below: \nSoon. pic.twitter.com/vEWhnFPsTb\nAugust 1, 2023\nAs you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. \n“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.\n\"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” \n\nWe’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023. \nWhat do you think of the game’s teaser?

Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. \nYou can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:\n\n\nFortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. \nAs for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. \nFortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan. \nAre you going to pick up any of these Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins?

Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). \n\n\nThe publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. \nVGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.\nIn February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. \nRegardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nWhat do you want from a next-gen Nintendo console?

          "description": "Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. \nSquare Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. \nCheck out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nYoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. \n“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”\nFor more about Dawntrail, head to Game Informer's story featuring everything you need to know about the expansion. \nStory in development...\nWhat do you think of the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail trailer?

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. \nSony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. \n\n\nThat’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.\nHowever, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.\n\n\nSEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it: \n\n\nFor more, read Game Informer’s PlayStation 5 review to find out why we love the console, and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 best PS5 games after that. \nDo you have a PS5?

It was one of my favorite games of last year, and you can read about why in my review of The Entropy Centre.

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. \nAs was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.\nThe Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.\nTo see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.",

I’m watching the first teaser for Peacock’s Twisted Metal, and while I wasn’t sure what to expect from an adaptation of one of my favorite childhood franchises, whatever hopes I had fell away watching this strange out-of-context clip. Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up?

Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. \nSea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  \nSea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

Despite the wordplay in the title, the game is unexpectedly dark and violent, which is surprising considering the team's last game is about a cat on a Metroid-inspired mission. In any case, we like what we've played so far. Gunbrella is coming to PC and Switch some time this year.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and me as we check out some early gameplay and defeat the game's first boss.\n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about The Crew Motorfest, Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.",

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!",
