With the popularity of Star Fox 64, fans were expecting a brand new 3D rail shooter on the N64's successor, the GameCube. Instead, Nintendo's then-collaborator Rare created something fans weren't expecting — Star Fox Adventures, a fully 3D action-adventure game in the style of the Zelda series.\nNowadays, Rare's final Nintendo title (and its only GameCube game) is looked back upon pretty fondly despite how starkly different it is compared to the first two games in the Star Fox series. So fondly, in fact, that the fan community has created something truly spectacular, inspired by Fox McCloud's adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not so much in the sense that you can brag to your friends about owning something they couldn't possibly hope to get their hands on; no, that's quite insufferable, if you ask us. Rather, the idea of owning something valuable and precious, taking the effort to look after it and keep it in good condition is a wholly different story.\nWe'd be willing to bet that quite a few of you lovely readers probably own a rare video game or a rare piece of merchandise of some sort. We'd also be willing to bet that most of you would much rather keep hold of such an item for as long as possible, regardless of its potential value. After all, owning something of such prestige from a beloved IP means something, right?

You don't even need to follow the Sonic Official JP Twitter account and you can alternatively submit a question via the official Sonic Channel website.

Bouncing in the air gets you experience points, and once you've reached enough to level up, when you land all four wheels on the ground, you can upgrade your impenetrable tank and add more enemies for more hectic hopping!\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You control a robot through these dungeons — which are semi-random a selected from a variety of pre-programmed layouts — and level up the character controlling the Unitron robot.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano's development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again. \nRead more",

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like \"Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,\" and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we've heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

          "description": "From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience.

          "description": "The strongest (and priciest) woman in the world\nDeluxe merch-maker Prime 1 Studio is back again, bringing with it the latest release in their stunning range of premium \"Masterline\" character statues. Following on from 2021's attractive diorama of Devil May Cry's Dante, this new statue immortalizes one of the most iconic and recognizable video game characters of all time, Street Fighter's Chun-Li.\nStanding at 1/4 scale (roughly 30 inches in height, including base), this gorgeous statue depicts The Strongest Woman in the World as she appears in Street Fighter V, bedecked in her classic Street Fighter II costume and daubed in its alternate pink coloring. The highly dynamic posing sees Chunners flowing with powerful energy, just a frame away from unleashing her devastating Critical Art attack.\n\nClearly, the fight has raged for quite some time, as our hero stands atop the debris of a decimated \"Bustling Side Street\" stage. The K.O. is most assuredly close. This Limited Edition also comes packaged with an alternate head, allowing fans to pose the Interpol agent in full focused combat mode, or coyly winking at the hapless opponent about to get sent into the stratosphere.\nNow, the damage. The Premium Masterline Street Fighter V Chun-Li Pink Costume Limited Edition statue (phew) is no slouch on the wallet, retailing for a princely $1,099 USD (not including shipping). Truly limited, the statue has a meager format size of only 150, so she will be quite rare, even by premium statue standards. If you are a die-hard fan of the battlin' babe, then you can place your pre-order over on the official Prime 1 Studio store right now. Payment options are available, with Chunners expected to ship in late-2022/early 2023.\nYatta!\nThe post Stunning Chun-Li statue coming to Kikoken your bank account appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Jigsaw not quite falling into place\nBloober Team almost ended up tackling a very different horror franchise than Blair Witch. In a new interview, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno says the studio was offered the chance to take on several horror IPs including Saw, but passed on them for Blair Witch.\nSpeaking to IGN during the Digital Dragons games conference in Poland, Babieno described how the Blair Witch deal came to be. Bloober was in talks with multiple major movie studios, but passed on offers. Then came Lionsgate.\nLionsgate expressed admiration for Layers of Fear and Observer. The studio offered a list of horror IPs and, according to Babieno, offered Bloober its choice of one.\n\"We could [have chosen] Saw, which is more popular than Blair Witch, but we decided to take Blair Witch because the universe has many opportunities to build something new,\" said Babieno. \"That was the reason why we chose this project.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhaDPDf-xsM\nHe goes on to say that being offered these licenses wasn't a one-off, and the studio has received more offers since Blair Witch. Bloober Team turned them down though, due to other projects in the pipeline.\n\"Unfortunately, for almost one year, we have [had to say] 'pass' to almost everything, because we don't have capacity to do any more titles at one time,\" said Babieno.\nTime to play a game\nIt's an interesting game of what-if to play, imagining Bloober's version of a Saw video game. The team went on to tackle Blair Witch instead though, and has seemingly kept busy since.\nCurrently, Bloober is working with Konami, though the product of that partnership hasn't been announced. That hasn't stopped the studio from being the subject of Silent Hill speculation, though.\nThe team is also working on another project with Take-Two publishing arm Private Division, and another that Babieno teases is in pre-production.\nThe post Bloober Team passed on the chance to make a Saw game in favor of Blair Witch appeared first on Destructoid.",

While most of us are likely to take our dead device to an e-waste center and move onto the next one, some gamers out there seem to be a bit more sentimental — and technically skilled in dismantling old hardware.\nIn a post on the r/gaming Subreddit, user Wolve5000 showed off their memorialized Nintendo DS Lite, and it has to be one of the most beautiful ways I've ever seen someone recycle an old console. Essentially they dismantled the …",

From crazy-eyed alpacas and magical unicorns, to yee-hawing ponies and even a grumpy lil' goat, TFH combines cartoon quality art and animation with solid, old-school mechanics for a unique fighting game experience.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92rTB2wyPPo\nOriginally conceived as a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan game, developer Mane6 quickly readjusted its design plans when Hasbro lawyers came a'callin. This proved to be the best thing that could happen for the project, however, and with fresh designs from Friendship is Magic creator Lauren Faust at hand, the Mane6 team embarked on its own original scrapper. A true passion project, Them's Fightin' Herds has seen more intensive and passionate developer support than many fighters 50 times its size and popularity.\nThe console edition of Them's Fightin' Herds will launch for $19.99. A Deluxe Edition, available for $39.99, includes a season pass for four new upcoming characters, as well as new stages and other cosmetics.

As the below video on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild detail points out, there are actually two ways the final memory can play out:\nOne involves Link finding the memory as normal (this is the path most players will take).\nThe other includes a subtle extra bit of footage, provided that players actually take a photo of the picture on the wall in Impa's abode.\nThe short video showcases all of the differences, starting with the \"alternate\" cut, then showing the way 99% of the playerbase likely saw it: followed by a supercut of both endings in one, with the former lasting a tad longer in length.\nLike many Zelda: Breath of the Wild discoveries, a lot of people are probably like \"so, what?\" But the fact that so many of these sorts of things exist is a testament to its enduring legacy. Folks are still uncovering little tricks of the trade, and in an era where nearly everything is spoiled online in a week and everything is forgotten quickly, that's a feat.\nWhile some are tired of the Breath of the Wild discourse, for once, I'm glad that a game can live on beyond the initial zeitgeist explosion.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDYOH-ZJs2U&t\nThe post Check out this really cool subtle Zelda: Breath of the Wild final memory detail appeared first on Destructoid.",

Originally, developer Sad Cat Studios was aiming for a 2022 launch. But today, the studio announced Replaced has been delayed to 2023.\nSad Cat Studios is based out of Belarus, with a team of developers from Belarus and Ukraine. In today's statement, the team cites the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying it has heavily impacted the development of Replaced, as most of the team resides in neighboring regions.\n\"The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families,\" reads today's statement. \"As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced.\"\nDue to this, the publisher Coatsink, Thunderful, and developer all decided to move the release window to 2023. The team is continuing to work on Replaced, but says it is prioritizing the physical and mental health of its developers by not forcing the original deadline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWkOcpZEk4I\nEnter the void\nReplaced does look pretty rad, with some incredible pixel art and style to it. But the decision to take a little more time for the studios' well-being is a good one, and a little extra time is a pittance compared to making sure the team at Sad Cat Studios is doing okay.\nThe war in Ukraine has had an effect on many of the game studios in the region. In response to the situation, many publishers and developers called for aid, to help those affected by the invasion. Recently, Epic and Microsoft teamed up to donate Fortnite proceeds towards various charities, ultimately raising $144 million in support.\nOther companies have also responded by removing their games from sale. CD Projekt halted sales in Russia and Belarus, and Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from several of its sports games.\nThe post Stylish indie Replaced has been delayed to 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A collector's edition has also been announced, and will feature a statue of the three starters, a card set, pins, patches, and a collector's box.\nIf you've never played or heard of it before Jordan has a great writeup here, but suffice to say it's essentially a different take on the Pokemon formula. You play the role of a tamer [trainer], and attempt to catch creatures and battle them. The studio calls it a \"massive multiplayer creature-collection adventure.\"\n\nBilled as the \"1.0\" edition following a lengthy early access period, the story campaign involves \"six vivid islands,\" with a narrative involving the \"evil Clan Belsoto.\" Of course, there's chilling involved too, with activities like fishing and hanging around the open world. Unlike Pokemon, the team has embraced online play, and allows you to \"see other tamers around\" on the map and fight in co-op form. Player housing is in too, as well as outfit customization and competitive elements (which involves a round of bans and picks until you square off in a 5v5 format).\nNew stuff that's coming to Temtem 1.0 includes seasonal updates and a battle pass system, with free and premium tracks. There's also a \"final endgame island,\" which has new vendors, places to explore, and more battle opportunities. Quests will be updated \"weekly and regularly.\"\nWith the level of success this game has reached before 1.0, it stands to reason that it'll be supported for some time after Temtem is out in September.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfMsEm9K0cE\nThe post Pokemon-like Temtem is out in September on PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a five-star hydro archer, she'll join Kuki Shinobu (a four-star electro support) as the main gang of update 2.7. A \"drumalong rhythm game,\" a new Archon Quest taking place in the Chasm, and Xiao/Arataki Itto banner re-runs are on the menu come May 31, too.\nWhat I love about Genshin is how much variety there is when it comes to the cast. Anything is possible, from criminal underlords to magical girls, to stalwart shonen types.

Capcom just finished its video series on the whole lot, which you can peruse below.\nIn short, Sunbreak is reworking how every weapon operates with extra Silkbind abilities. With the new abilities, Capcom has addressed some of the shortcomings of several weapons. Most of them seem to be focused on adding more maneuverability into the mix, and several are actually extremely low-key for an expansion — in a good way!\nIt looks like Capcom used some restraint for the Sunbreak weapon changes, particularly for the Light Bowgun, which debuted its changes today. One key ability is the Wyvern Counter, which is an \"urgent retreat that fires a shot with a massive recoil.\" Think of it like a blast dodge.\nIn a sense, each weapon will feel distinctly different with a higher skill ceiling, without sacrificing the original intent and mechanical foundation. Well that's the goal, anyway!

As of this week, it's currently on Paramount Plus (US) — and a trial period or a one-month subscription is likely less than buying it digitally elsewhere. It's coming to Blu-ray and physical form on August 9.\nAlso, note that to celebrate the Sonic 2 streaming release, a new short called \"Sonic Drone Home\" is being teased (which you can peruse below) that comes with digital purchases (or is available on YouTube). While it does feature Ben Schwartz reprising his role as Sonic from the feature films, sadly, Idris Elba and Colleen O'Shaughnessey do not appear to return as Knuckles and Tails respectively. As far as the animation goes, hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the Knuckles TV show.\nHaving finally caught Sonic 2 yesterday, like the first film, it was a pleasant surprise. While the live-action characters sometimes stop the narrative dead in its tracks, I appreciated the focus on Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and Jim Carrey is always a delight. I'm really curious who they're going to cast for that post-credits tease character — and how they're going to handle the edge!\nhttps://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1528797723431936015\nThe post Sonic 2 is streaming now and available digitally appeared first on Destructoid.",

Currently in development for PC, Family Battle: Tag Arena promises multiplayer mayhem in a colorful anime world that hosts one too many superheroes.\nYou'll have to bear with me, as details are understandably muddled, but it appears that Family Battle, true to its title, is the tale of two extended families of superpowered heroes, facing off to determine who is the one true \"Super Family.\" This war will play out in a series of two-on-two arena-based battles, with teams stepping into the role of their chosen family members — all of which carry their own unique skills, abilities, powers, and play styles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZKNRlCIdGQ\nWith one player in the role of \"Attacker\" and a second player as \"Support,\" the two teams engage in fast-paced and chaotic 3D warfare, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks as well as their own respective powers to take the fight. While the attacking characters get down and dirty on the front line, it is up to the supporting player to disrupt the enemy from long-range — laying traps, clearing out hazards, or providing their partner with offensive and defensive buffs. With strong chemistry and quick communication, a team can use its strategy and synergy to bring the bragging rights back home.\nFamily Battle: Tag Arena is currently in development for PC (via Steam). It will enter an Early Access period from August 6, but you can check out the official store page right now.

That's at least the case for me, maybe because I'm still a baby CoD fan, because I'm pumped to try out the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, especially now that it has a release date. They're really building the suspense on this one — first the logo reveal last month, now the art reveal, and then some potential new announcements teased for the future.\nThe Call of Duty Twitter officially revealed the next franchise entry's release date this morning: October 28, 2022. Along with that info, we also got a short video showing off the art for some of the game's characters, which includes a return of Task Force 141, who were also principal characters in the original Modern Warfare 2. We also caught a glimpse of a mysterious numbered sequence that reads \"J-8-22\" at around the 44-second mark, which just might be an important date for fans to look forward to.\nhttps://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1529137835764228097\nThis title is actually a reboot sequel of the 2009 game with the exact same name, something that has caused a few fans (including myself) a bit of confusion this time around. Modern Warfare 2 is truly a beloved title in Call of Duty history, so it makes a lot of sense that Activision would want to bring it back for another go-around. We got some really iconic missions from that game, like \"Wolverines!\" and \"Cliffhanger,\" so here's hoping we get to see some other really memorable adventures this time around, too.\nI personally love a good sniper mission, but something I always look forward to in a good CoD campaign is those larger-than-life set pieces. Here's hoping that Infinity Ward can deliver this time around, and revamp the series in a way we've needed in the past few years.\nThe post The new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 finally has a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, he isn't, but his suit and haircut sure are. Ubisoft has announced that it is collaborating with Sega to bring character skins of the Yakuza hero — as well as his one-time love interest and ass-kicking partner, Kaoru Sayama — to its popular online squad shooter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rnZeKj9SWM\nThe Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle, which launches on all platforms today, includes looks for Siege's resident \"Team Japan,\" Hibana and Echo. In addition to the character skins, new weapon skins will kit Hibana out with a Police-themed rifle skin, while Echo gets a pearl-colored rifle skin emblazoned with the legendary Dragon of Dojima. Though these are, essentially, Siege characters in cosplay, it's still pretty weird to see even a dollar store Kazuma carrying a gun. Later this season, a new Elite skin will see Echo transform into the wildly unpredictable Goro Majima, as teased in the above trailer.\nThis is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege has ventured into \"guest skins\" territory. Back in 2020, Rainbow squad leader Ash got her Lara Croft on, while 2021 saw Zofia don the iconic S.T.A.R.S. garb of Resident Evil's Jill Valentine. These crossover costumes are part of Rainbow Six Siege's continued progression into a wider universe of lore — evolving from its nationalistic and stringently militant, roots into a more approachable, character-driven, alternate universe. Another example of this new direction lies in the icky, sci-fi sensibilities of 2021's Rainbow Six Extraction, which saw the counter-terrorist team battle a literal alien invasion.\nRainbow Six Siege and Rainbow Six Extraction are available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Funko just announced the first wave of Pops based on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and I'm guessing we'll see more in the days to come.\nThis line offers a new version of Obi-Wan, looking slightly older than he did in Revenge of the Sith.

After finding promising results in Trails From Zero, he brought the technique over to Ys IX. Lo and behold, there was an impressive frame rate boost with the same implementation, with a 25% increase in parts of the game where the CPU can bottleneck performance.

          "description": "Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is the sixth entry in Level-5’s beloved JRPG series. The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. \n\n\nLike the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: \n“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” \nFor all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. \nKim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:\n“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”\n\n\nHopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.",

          "description": "After finding success on PC, 2D fighter Them’s Fightin’ Herds is making its way to consoles this fall.\nIf the game reminds you of My Little Pony, it should. Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic's launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. \n\n\nThem’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. \nThe console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. \nThem’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.",

Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. \nThis news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. \n“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”\nEG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” \nIt sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future.

However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. \n\n\n“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.\n“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”\n\nThe story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet. \nYou can view the full patch notes for Leviathan here.\nAre you going to be checking out Leviathan today?

However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. \nMore specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. \n\n\nThat includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. \n“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”\nHowever, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here.

          "description": "Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.\nA PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. \n\n\nThe DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. \nThe controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  \nTo learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.",

Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.\nFor a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.\n\nWhile we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release.

The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.\n\n\nThe game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. \nGameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. \nWe last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo.

          "description": "Marvel Studios has released a new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer that runs more than two minutes long and features a ton of new footage, especially compared to the teaser trailer released last month. \nThe new trailer features extended looks at scenes from the teaser, like when Thor realizes Jane Foster is back and now wielding Mjolnir. It also contains new footage of Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the villain of Taika Waititi’s latest Thor film, Gorr the God Butcher.\n\n\nFor comic fans, one look at Christian Bale’s Gorr, and it’s immediately apparent that this is a very different take. Gorr is typically more alien-looking but still humanoid. Bale’s Gorr looks very much like a human, and it’s not surprising because if you’re going to hire someone like Bale to play a villain, why not squeeze out as much as you can by reminding folks that this is Bale. \nHowever, regardless of where you fall on “he’s too human” or “I like it,” it’s hard to disagree that Bale’s Gorr is appropriately metal. Right off the bat, Gorr the God Butcher is an incredible title to hold if you’re a villain. Couple that with his first announcement – that all gods need to die, including Thor – and his design, which features black-tipped fingers, a planet-shattering weapon, and a black liquid that runs out of his mouth, and Gorr might be the most metal MCU villain yet. \n\nFor more, watch the first Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer and then listen to this episode of From Panel To Podcast, which is Game Informer’s comic book podcast, to hear us talk about Thor: Love and Thunder. \nWhat did you think of this trailer?

Zynga is notable for its globally enjoyed small screen titles like Farmville and CSR Racing 2, the most popular mobile racing game. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick voiced his company's excitement about the deal, stating:\n\"We are thrilled to complete our combination with Zynga, which is a pivotal step to increase exponentially our Net Bookings from mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we bring together our exceptional talent, exciting pipelines of games, and industry-leading technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can take our portfolio to another level of creativity, innovation, and quality.\"\nZynga CEO Frank Gibeau responded in kind, \"We are excited for Zynga's next-generation mobile platform, free-to-play expertise, diverse offering of games and incredible team to join the Take-Two family. We are eager to continue building an unparalleled portfolio of games that will reach broader markets and lead to continued growth for this next chapter of Zynga's history.\"\nPerhaps we'll see more mobile ports or versions of Take-Two titles in the coming years. This deal comes hot off of financial reports that revealed the launch of more than 69 Take-Two games over the next three years. Only time will tell what fruit is born of this monumental merger. Acquisition culture is growing in the games industry. Sony recently hired a Corporate Development Director to spearhead growth opportunities through acquisitions, and Microsoft's Phil Spencer reiterated Xbox's commitment to buying studios that are \"a good fit.\" \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that's basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.\nHe's a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like \"Ram Grenade Down Throat,\" \"Blow Opponent in Half,\" and \"Fire Hole Through Opponent.\" The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer's archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.\nI doubt we'll ever see Lobo in a game, but there's a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.",

This news comes by way of the Paramount Plus Twitter account, which includes a new riff on the Sonic The Hedgehog 2 movie poster you’ve likely already seen. \n#SonicMovie2 is racing to #ParamountPlus! Haven't seen it yet or want to watch it over and over again? Stream it TOMORROW! pic.twitter.com/AGWYB82Cos\nMay 23, 2022\nHere are Game Informer, we loved Sonic The Hedgehog 2, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and while 2022 is void of much competition in the video game adaptation space, save for Uncharted, it’s one of our favorite video game movies in a while. Sonic fans clearly showed up, too, because not only did Sonic The Hedgehog 2 score the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, but it’s also the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the U.S. as well. \nIn the meantime, check out this story about the scrapped “Ugly Sonic” movie design that makes a cameo in Disney Plus’ new Chip ‘n Dale movie. \nHave you seen Sonic The Hedgehog 2?

The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. \nThe four sets respectively are:\nRyu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off\nChun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance\nGuile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength\nKen Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect\n\nThe two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. \n“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” \nThis collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year. \nWhat SF vs. TMNT matchups would you like to see?

In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.\nA brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they're seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.\nHot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I'd assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.\nThe Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules. For more on Hot Wheels Unleashed, read our review of the racer here, and for more Looney Tunes nonsense, check out our preview and videos of MultiVersus.",

          "description": "2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. \nLost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. \n\n\nBefore launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. \n\n\nAt launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  \nYou can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game's price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.",

Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. \nFunnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. \nAs Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. \nOver on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  \nWhile PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe's Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.\n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you excited about these two games?

We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. \nUnlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.\n\n\nThe regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.\nIn episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that \"Transcendence\" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.\nWhen looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.\nThank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. \nWhat do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below.

Players control a young girl with the magical ability to inhabit the bodies of animals as well as inanimate objects, such as coconuts. Exploration involves sailing to different tropical islands in an open ocean as well as climbing through forests and soaring across the landscape on a glider. The game last appeared at the 2021 Game Awards where it got a 2022 release window. \nUpdate on Tchia ⬇️💚 pic.twitter.com/knQYkJSYT1\nMay 20, 2022\nDeveloper Awaceb posted an update on Twitter explaining that it needs to delay the game to tinker on it further, saying in part “this extra time will allow us to really polish every aspect of the game and flesh out all the little details that we know will make Tchia a really special experience.” \nTchia is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. \nIt seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. \nDeath Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that. \n[Source: Leo via GamerUP]\nDo you want a sequel to Death Stranding? Let us know in the comments below!",

The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.\nIf you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  \nKeep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. \nAs a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”\nFor more information, visit Nintendo’s Q&A support page for the shutdown process.",

Please note that the ScummVM version does have one obvious limitation, though.. the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
