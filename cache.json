Over the last two years, there’s been plenty of time for interesting little info trinkets to be packed and despatched from the Wired Productions warehouse. There was the time the game competed at the Venice Film Festival, the time director Jörg Tittel pitched development across cinematic and interactive mediums in Jerry Bruckheimer’s offices, and the relatively more grounded time that an all-star Hollywood voice cast was announced. Finally, we can look beyond the hype and hold the game in our hands.\nThe Last Worker sees you taking on the role of Kurt, an employee and full-time resident at the fulfilment warehouse of futuristic retailed and Amazon-alike Jüngle. Your job is to fly around on a little hover-cart, using a kind of handheld traction beam gun to take boxes from shelves and ship them through huge suction chutes. The odd thing about the scenario is that all your colleagues are robots. The job has been automated and the workforce downsized to just one: you. You are – and you’ll have seen where this is going – the last worker.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.\nPlaying with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.\nRead more",

Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.\nSo yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.\nRead more",

It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.\nSo what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.\nRead more",

There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. \nIt was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website.

          "description": "There’s always been something quaintly practical about the name Command & Conquer. Sure, there’s a touch of Julius Caesar’s ‘veni, vidi, vici’ in there. But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.\r\n\nBack then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.\nRead more",

In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it's definitely the latter. The free demo is out now, and throws you into the first couple of puzzles for the game as Alex, whose last memory is of being at home in her apartment. Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company.

For the uninitiated, Tax Heaven 3000 is the anime dating sim that claims to do your taxes and asks you for identifying info such as your email and Social Security Number. It’s likely a joke app, partly because of its waifu Iris (like, the IRS) and partly because it’s from MSCHF, the art collective behind Lil Nas X’s Satan Shoes and other viral drops.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. \"You want him to get attacked,\" game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.\nIn truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.\nRead more",

My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure.

You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.\nThere are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One).

After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn't quite sure what. \"I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'\" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. \"Okay!?\" Humble says incredulously. \"I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it.\"\nSo began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. \"I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,\" says Humble. \"Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.\" And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.\nRead more",

While that might sound bad, it arguably means that it's balanced an appealing strategic challenge with the grinding theme of trench warfare.\nThe Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It's perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.\nRead more",

It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.\nThere's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent.

Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.\nFrom playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.\n Read more",

This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you'll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.\n Read more",

I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP's teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you're interested to know what I thought:\nGoodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It's part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.\nI had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won't have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.\n Read more",

          "description": "It's almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that's exactly what we've done at PAX East. There's a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we've chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.\nEverything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West's multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it's nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.\nSome of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.\n Read more",

          "description": "“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we've only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”\r\n\n\r\nEvery so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes.

That's a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that's before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it's a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. \nCrucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let's face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we're here in the first place.

There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn't possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I've only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They're forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you'll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that's white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. \nIt's unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that's the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you'll find in Davy Jones' locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what's out there, whether it's real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you'll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.\nRead more",

Developers faxdoc, happyquared, sunnydaze, and publisher Playism have confirmed that Rusted Moss will land on PC via Steam on April 12.\nThis twin-stick, side-scrolling shooter has some definite Metroid vibes. With the same sort of grid-based map and world to explore, it feels a bit familiar. But its own unique quality lies in the grappling hook.\nOne of Rusted Moss' core features is a grapple, letting the protagonist Fern hook and swing across the world. That, plus big guns, makes for a pretty fast and active side-scrolling shooter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iteSJWwSaAg\nIt's a full-on twin-stick shooter too, so no limits on what direction you can point. Add in some big, chaotic boss fights, and this feels like a search-action game made for folks who want a little more adrenaline in their secret hunting.\nThe hook brings you back\nI've played the demo for Rusted Moss a few times, at PAX and through events like Steam demo festivals. Heck, the demo for Rusted Moss has stayed live and is playable right now if you head over to the store page.\nEach time, I've really enjoyed the mix of movement and shooting that feels like it's got shades of Titanfall or Spider-Man. It's punishing in a good way, though I definitely recommend tinkering with the grapple options to find the playstyle that suits you best.\nWith April looking a little light compared to the heavy-hitters of May and June, it might be a good time to check out a smaller title like Rusted Moss. The demo's there either way, and if it hooks you in, the full game hits on April 12.\nThe post Grapple-swinging shooter Rusted Moss arrives on Steam in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

Windy Meadow bills itself as a “counterpart” to Roadwarden rather than a sequel or spin-off.\nDid you play Roadwarden? I completely missed it. Looking at it now, I think I’m going to need to make time for it. The publisher calls it as a “slice of life” narrative where you immerse yourself in the goings-on of a small community where decisions matter.\nhttps://youtu.be/P6VRhcTW3k4\nWhat interests me about Windy Meadow is that, although it’s considered a visual novel, “99%” of the text is dialogue. The visuals instead do the heavy lifting of communicating what’s happening. While I understand why developers use static images to communicate their stories since video games are a visual medium, that tends to go unutilized by the genre. So, that’s something I’d like to see experimented with.\nThe publisher says the narrative “seamlessly weaves coziness and melancholy,” which is also how I’d describe eating a sandwich from Arby’s in bed. The story puts you in the footwear of three separate protagonists, with different paths for each.\nSound fantastic. I’m probably going to pick up Roadwarden soon, but if you’re more interested in what you’re hearing here, there’s a demo available starting today.\nWindy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale will release for PC sometime this year.\nThe post Windy Meadow spins off of Roadwarden this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'm already a sucker for projects featuring traps as the core mechanic, but Doombad was sleek, cute, and a blast to play in short bursts or long sessions. Sadly, like many mobile games of that era (particularly under the Adult Swim banner), it was eventually put out to pasture. Given that it's miraculously coming back this year on Steam (self-published by Grumpyface no less), it'll likely have a longer shelf life.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix66i9eYX4M\nIn what is still a fun twist, you're playing the role of the bad guy (Dr. Lord Evilstein). Much like a tower defense game or an action trapper like Deception or Orcs Must Die, your job is to use all sorts of gadgets (mounted on walls, the floor, or the ceiling) and minions to defend your castle. It has a really striking cartoony aesthetic to back it all up, and seeing Dr. Lord Evilstein cradle his fingers as he operates within the confines of his private office will never get old for me.\nHere's what the 2023 version has that the original mobile release didn't:\nRemastered/remade visuals\n35 traps/minions to use\nGamepad/mouse and keyboard support\nNew content\nLive now on Steam in wishlist form, it's set to debut later in 2023.

The HD-2D remake of the Super Famicom classic is getting ported to PlayStation 4 and PS5, as well as PC via Steam, on April 27.\nSquare Enix released the HD-2D remake of Live A Live last year, and it was certainly a bit of a surprise. This RPG with multiple \"paths\" and protagonists had long eluded the west. The Switch release not only brought it over, but revitalized it with some quality-of-life updates and revamped graphics.\nNow, PlayStation and Steam users can experience the journey themselves. Live A Live will go for $49.99, though there's a $10 off pre-order bonus running right now. Also, all platforms are getting a demo, which is currently live right now for PS4, PS5, and Steam. It sounds like it's a similar demo to the Switch version, letting you try out the Wild West, Edo Japan, and Distant Future sections.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjQPmA-QmeU\nThe remake includes remastered music from Yoko Shimomura too, and let me tell you: the version of \"Megalomania\" in the Live A Live update is absolutely phenomenal.\nMore lives to lead\nIf you're completely unfamiliar, Live A Live follows several different heroes throughout the eras and their individual journeys, as they eventually come together to fight a greater evil. If that sounds familiar, that's because yes, Octopath Traveler owes a fair bit to the original Live A Live.\nWhat makes Live A Live such an interesting game is that each era has its own mechanics and systems, making their playthroughs remarkably distinct. The Edo Japan period is a Metal Gear-style castle infiltration, while Present Day is basically RPG Street Fighter. It's a really interesting game for RPG fans to dig into, and something that we found still largely succeeds almost three decades later.\nLive A Live arrives on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam on April 27.\nThe post Live A Live heads to PlayStation and Steam in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

The charming card strategy sets out on a treacherous climb on April 12 for PC and Nintendo Switch.\nWildfrost sets you out on a perilous journey up through the mountains, with only a deck full of companions and items by your side. You're trying to reach the Sun Temple to bring back the sunlight, so until then, everything's going to be a bit chilly.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh1roF9RBh8\nIt's a roguelite, where each run will net you new boons and assistance back in town. This can range from new cards to special effects, letting your squad get stronger and stronger until the summit doesn't seem so far away after all.\nAlongside building up the town of Snowdwell for more cards and challenges, there are also Leaders to use from different tribes, each with their own playstyle. And the counter system is a neat way of encouraging you to pay attention to cards' stats and weaknesses, beyond just a numbers game.\nI can go the distance\nI played a bit of Wildfrost during the Steam Next Fest a while back and found it to be fun and lighthearted, while still providing me a decent challenge. The art style is very memorable, especially if you've grown tired of the more grim takes on deckbuilding out there.\nAnd with a $19.99 price tag, it seems pretty likely you can get a good hour-to-dollar count ratio out of this one. If you're looking for another deckbuilder to eat up the hours, Wildfrost might just be the fit when it arrives on April 12.

          "description": "Not attaching to enough faces\nBloomberg has revealed that Sony’s new PlayStation VR2 Headset is projected to sell fewer than 300,000 units by the end of March. How much less? Well, PSVR2 is on track to hit 270,000. This is according to estimates from the International Data Corporation, a research firm that tracks these sorts of things.\nConsidering that Sony was looking to make 2 million units in its first three months (though it reportedly slashed this to 1 million and then refuted those reports), this is a pretty disappointing start. IDC analyst Francisco Geronimo has said that a price cut will be needed to avert disaster since many countries are facing a cost-of-living crisis, and many large corporations have announced massive layoffs in recent months.\nMy job involves covering video games, and I can’t justify the cost of VR. If I could, I’d want one to use on my PC, and the PSVR2 is locked entirely to the PS5. If I dug up buried treasure and was able to afford more than one VR headset, I’d still be hesitant to buy a PSVR2 since I don’t have the space to have a bunch of VR headsets lying around. So, in summary, if Sony wants me to have a PSVR2, it should not only just give me one but also buy me a house so I have the space for it.\nFor people who already have money and a house, PSVR2 has been marred by a shortage of available games and a complete lack of backward compatibility for PSVR1 games. Due to cost issues, VR is already a niche market, and Sony seems to be content with making it niche-er. I’m not a CEO, but when you take an already small market and try to take a slice of a smaller slice, then I don’t see how 2 million can happen. It doesn’t matter how fancy your tech is.\nI guess what I’m trying to say is: Virtual reality? In this economy?\nPSVR2 released on February 22, 2023 for a suggested price of $550.\nThe post PSVR2 is reportedly seeing disappointing sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A dire future\nThe Last Worker gives a unique perspective within the dystopian genre: a warehouse delivery employee for a monolithic organization. As the title suggests, you're the last person that hasn't been fired from this vital organization. Robots have replaced nearly everyone else at the company. However, as you find secrets about the shadowy owner, you're thrust into an investigation that can change the world forever.\nWith a concept like this, The Last Worker thankfully nails the storytelling with a thought-provoking script and impactful performances all around. Somehow, the developers Oiffy and Wolf & Wood Interactive make the act of organizing boxes entertaining, but with a time limit, it can feel frustratingly sluggish to control the character's levitating seat.\n[caption id=\"attac…",

The publisher is also taking a look at its real estate and shifting its strategy.\n\"As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,\" said CEO Andrew Wilson in a note to staff.\n\"This is the most difficult part, and we are working through the process with the utmost care and respect. Where we can, we are providing opportunities for our colleagues to transition onto other projects,\" Wilson said. \"Where that's not possible, we are providing severance pay and additional benefits such as health care and career transition services.\"\nEA started informing employees earlier in the quarter, and the publisher expects to be informing more affected workers into the next fiscal year, starting April 1.\nAdditionally, Wilson said the company is \"operating from a position of strength\" and will be focusing on a handful of priorities moving forward. This includes building games with large communities, making the most of those communities with social and creator tools, and creating blockbuster interactive storytelling.\nMore tech layoffs\nSome cuts to the workforce at EA were already made earlier this year, as over 200 QA staff working on Apex Legends were laid off recently from the Baton Rouge team.\nMeanwhile, Respawn recently announced a new studio to bolster Apex Legends development in Madison, Wisconsin.\nThe post EA is laying off 6% of its workforce amid restructuring appeared first on Destructoid.",

And while it's hitting many of the same notes as its predecessor, we got to go hands-on with its new spin on turn-based warfare: the Conquest mode.\nThe Conquest mode is one of Wargroove 2's big new features. It's a roguelike approach to battles that follows a familiar structure if you've ever played other styles of roguelike.

Not that it’s difficult. A happy memory can depress me.\nAnyway, a portion of Mortal Meal was featured on the Haunted PS1 Demo Disc: Spectral Mall compilation that was released back in 2022. The Haunted PS1 Demo Disc is sort of a nexus for experimental, lo-fi horror, and somehow I’m not on their mailing list. Thankfully, it usually passes my radar eventually.\nMortal Meal is perhaps a direct take on the genre, being largely a walking simulator. It’s also not terribly scary, but then, how would I know? It’s more focused on telling a melancholic narrative while weaving in a bit of levity and some fantastic horror imagery.\n[caption…",

It was a roughly 10-minute slice of gameplay, the most we've seen of the game thus far. And for me, I don't think I need to see any more of it until launch.\nZelda's gameplay showcase, hosted by series producer Eiji Aonuma, might seem unassuming compared to other big gameplay spotlights. It had the same tenor as the character reveals for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate; rather than make a big production or splice together a sizzle reel, it was just a chopped-and-guided tour through the new Hyrule. For one of year's biggest presumptive hits, it was a chill stream that let the game speak for itself. And it really did talk.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/wa…",

Pre-sale tickets are live now, and you can get them here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETr8BrD_Fp0\nTicket pricing tiers for the Shin Megami Tensei Anime Expo concert:\nVIP Pit (Standing) = $95\nVIP Balcony = $85\nGA Floor (Standing) = $70\nGA Balcony = $50\nSimilar to many Comic-Cons and the like, there's an add-on, too:\n\"A pre-show reception is scheduled and will feature early access to concert merchandise, a meet-and-greet with the show hosts, a themed autograph card signed by the show hosts, light hors d'oeuvres, and more. The pre-show reception will have limited availability and is a $125 add-on to all concert ticket purchases.\"\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_371316\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Atlus[/caption]\nThe post Atlus shares new details for the Shin Megami Tensei 30th anniversary concert, including guests appeared first on Destructoid.",

Free for the month of April will be Sackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZOk3fj5ujNM\nBeginning with Sackboy: The Big Adventure, this 2020 LittleBigPlanet spin-off was described as Destructoid’s resident snack-cake, Chris Carter, as a “chill platformer.” It ditches the creation suite that was such a focus of the LittleBigPlanet games to instead create a unique and charming platformer.\nhttps://youtu.be/ncT9bACGd5Q\nNext up is Meet Your Maker from Behaviour Interactive. This title is currently unreleased, so it you’ll be able to grab it free on its launch date if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Behaviour Interactive describes it as a first-person build and raid game. It has a co-op and base-building focus, so it’s something to grab if you need a game to share with a friend. If you have one.\nhttps://youtu.be/TMJF8hH8RGE\nFinally, Tails of Iron is a Souls-like action-RPG, that Destructoid’s resident tough-lad, Chris Moyse, described as one of the most distinctive RPG experiences of 2021.\nThere’s nothing on this list that strikes me as something I need to download and play right away, but they’re all welcome additions to the library. Sackboy and Tails of Iron are both well-loved titles, while Meet Your Maker still needs to prove itself in the crucible of opinion.\nSackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron will be available to all PlayStation Plus subscribers on April 4, 2023 until May 1.\nThe post Sackboy gets offered up on the Monthly Playstation Plus altar for April appeared first on Destructoid.",

The special story DLC \"In Tanta We Trust\" arrives for Forspoken on PS5 and PC on May 26.\nThe DLC will dive into the world of Athia and its past, before the events of the main game. As Square Enix describes it, this DLC will show the battle that drove the Tantas to madness.\nhttps://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1641062989724884994/\nThe DLC will be up for purchase on May 26, and will also be available for owners of the Digital Deluxe Edition of Forspoken. If you got that version, you'll also get a few days' early access to the DLC.\nA new view of Athia\nForspoken was one of the first big games of 2023, and received a fairly lukewarm reception. In our own look at the game, it seems like Forspoken plays it safe in many areas, but does have some neat visuals and cool concept for its combat.\nStill, that's not always enough to save a game from the fallout. Square Enix announced that Luminous Productions, after launching Forspoken, is being absorbed into Square Enix. The publisher also characterized sales of Forspoken as \"lackluster,\" and review of it were \"challenging.\"\nMeanwhile, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda confirmed he's stepping down in June, with current company director Takashi Kiryu stepping up pending shareholder approval. It's a season of change for Square Enix, as some games miss marks and leadership shifts around, following a year where the company sold off some big studios.\nThe Forspoken story DLC In Tanta We Trust will drop for PS5 and PC on May 26.\nThe post Forspoken story DLC In Tanta We Trust arrives in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The phoenix rises\nThat was fast. Bandai Namco has dropped yet another trailer for Tekken 8, this one focusing on Ling Xiaoyu. Ling was previously unannounced for the game, so this trailer is a big reveal for her. I’m mostly just surprised that this happened so quickly after Jun Kazama capped off the reveal trailers for their already-revealed cast.\nThis maybe shouldn’t be a huge surprise. Ling Xiaoyu was introduced way back in Tekken 3 and has been in every entry since. She initially wanted to win enough money to build her own amusement park but eventually got wrapped up in the family drama of the Kazama family.\nhttps://youtu.be/vTd2XeL4ygQ\nThe trailer shows Ling Xiaoyu kicking her winged slippers at Nina Williams and King, who commenters have pointed out were her foes in the Tekken: Bloodline anime. Much of the time, she’s wearing her trademark smile right up until she gets mad and nukes King’s well-developed abs.\nLing Xiaoyu gets the spotlight after the previously shown characters: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, and Jun Kazama. Bandai Namco hasn’t said how large the roster is going to be, exactly, but they’ve certainly got a brisk pace going on with these trailers.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024.\nThe post Ling Xiaoyu doesn’t lose focus in the latest Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lechonk rides again\nGame Freak and Nintendo are no stranger to Pokemon promos: whether they require you to go to a retail location or not. This newest one unfortunately is the former; and oh, it's also tied to GameStop. Just like the flying Pikachu doled out at the launch of the new generation, this promo Pokemon is also in flight: and it's a pig. Get it?! With April Fools' coming up, you know someone couldn't resist. Yep, it's a flying tera type Lechonk.\nIf you follow the GameStop link in the announcement tweet, you'll just get a generic \"find a GameStop in my area\" landing page. But TCG site Pokebeach has more info, noting that the codes will be available in stores on March 31, in an effort to tie it to the Scarlet & Violet new TCG set. Welp, marketing kinda botched that connection! Pokebeach says that there is no purchase necessary for these promo cards (as in the past), which will provide a code to download the flying Lechonk.\nThere's also a separate promo going on featuring the Pokemon TCG, which is potentially linked to a $15 in-store purchase, as a reverse holo card. I say \"potentially\" because individual stores might not require said purchase, but that's going to be up to the stores themselves.\nEither way, you can get a free Lechonk. Maybe you already have 20.\nThe post The new Pokémon Scarlet & Violet promo is a flying pig, just in time for April Fools’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Tactics games are quite popular, as are their often-accompanying social mechanics and life-sim elements.

This event will run from March 31 to April 2, and it will repeat the following weekend from April 7 to April 9.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of 7-Star raids is sheer unpredictability. The moveset of any Pokemon can completely change which monster will counter it best, so it’s almost impossible to prepare for an event before it goes live. For example, Samurott is a Water-Type Pokemon with a Bug Tera Type, which means Flying-Type Pokemon should be the best counters.

This one, released in late March 2023, involves a \"Boston-themed banner.\" No, it's not a Dunkin Donuts/Ben Affleck promo. But there is a lobster (lobstah?) involved.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1640186892908937217\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNdesjIP2AA&t=7079s\nSaid banner is Boston-themed because of the recent Splatoon 3 tournament sponsored by Nintendo: which was held at PAX East this past weekend in Boston, Massachusetts.

That’s actually “Splatnet 3,” and it’s the app-within-the-app that you’ll need to use to scan the below codes.\nAfter Splatnet 3 loads, scroll to the bottom and look for the “QR Code Reader” icon.\nSelect “use your smartphone’s camera to scan a QR code” to directly scan codes from this article, or select “scan a QR code from a saved image” (you may need to give your app access to your phone’s camera or image collection).\nThat’s it! The code will then redeem and you’ll be able to pick the reward up from the in-game terminal.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting.

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.\n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft skipping E3? Do you expect the event to still take place?

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

You can see their tweet about the announcement below.\n🫡\n@jonspaihts - a talented writer and fellow Gears fan - to adapt an authentic live action Gears of War film with @netflix. https://t.co/OQ3HtpiJkB\nMarch 21, 2023\nWe still have no release window for the project, and given that they've only just attached a writer, it's probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie's existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.\nWho do you think should direct or star in the Gears movie?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nWhile waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nCrash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nAre you interested in Crash Team Rumble?

He was 60 years old. \nAt the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, \"law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural.\" Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor's public relations representative, that Reddick has died.\nBeyond \"The Wire,\" Reddick also had roles in other shows like \"Fringe,\" \"Lost,\" \"Bosch,\" and even last year's \"Resident Evil\" series on Netflix. His movie credits include the \"John Wick\" franchise (he was promoting the latest, \"John Wick 4,\" which hits theaters soon, just this week), \"Godzilla Vs. Kong,\" and more. \nOn the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2's Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation's Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy's Quantum Break. \nBelow are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick: \nStephanie Reddick\npic.twitter.com/MFwOwpRJK7\nMarch 18, 2023\nBungie\npic.twitter.com/csXjKcMOJy\nMarch 17, 2023\nGuerrilla\npic.twitter.com/22jzfB93iq\nMarch 18, 2023\n[Source: TMZ, Deadline]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Reddick's family.",

Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:\n\n\nIn this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.\nIn a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.\nWhat exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.\nWhich extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next?
