As usual, the latest game is expected to come with a \"new twist\" and that last part is what's sent the internet and social media into overdrive.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'd done a big run and put the game down.\nFast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I'm nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can't be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.\nRead more",

And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There's 'orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor.

For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.\r\n\n\nTainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.\nRead more",

I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.\r\n\n\r\nSomewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.\r\n\n\nWorld’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults.

The indie games I've been playing recently all have a bit of an end-of-the-world flavour to 'em, whether literal or metaphorical or by your own hand, if you feel like it. I dunno, I actually found them strangely relaxing, as a sort of counterpoint to the chaos of my own life during the holiday season. See what you think.\nRead more",

It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.\nBut then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.\nAnyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files.

Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal \"to play\" list is out of control.\nAnd yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?\nRead more",

He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.\nVertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated. \nRead more",

The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. \nThat said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse.

          "description": "After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie's smaller experimental entry in the series, Halo 3: ODST.\nHalo 3: ODST was released on the Xbox 360 on September 22, 2009, and was intended to be a smaller project designed by a skunkworks team. However, the development of ODST has roots in Peter Jackson's aborted attempt to make a Halo film/game. For the next hour, we talk about ODST's relatively short development time, why the title changed from Halo 3: Recon, the innovative Firefight multiplayer mode, and Bungie's push to spin out from under Microsoft and become its own company again.\nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game to not feature Master Chief.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.\nCheck out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub.

There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there's only one spot on a team open, and it's alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. \nThe King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.",

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

That continued today with a new six-minute trailer released on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account and while the entire video is in Japanese, it still gives us a great look at what’s in store for us in the Hisui region. \nNamely, the locations, pocket monsters, and NPCs we’ll be encountering. It also gives us our best look at the HUD and menu screens in Pokémon Legends: Arceus thus far as well. If you’ve been following this game since its announcement, you’ll notice that the game is looking much better than when it was first shown, too. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nPokémon Legends: Arceus has been described by Nintendo as an open-hub game, akin to the Monster Hunter series, rather than an open-world one and while that’s still the case, this trailer reveals these hubs are actually quite large – big enough to make flying around on a Pokémon or riding on the back of one in water very viable. \nThe entire trailer is exciting and it offers us our best look at Pokémon Legends: Arceus yet so if you’re excited for this upcoming RPG, it’s definitely worth six minutes of your time. \nFor more, be sure to check out this trailer released last month that introduces the Diamond and Pearl clans to the game and then read about how Hisuian Voltorb still somehow looks like a Pokéball.

For the upcoming sequel, Guerrilla Games looked at fan feedback, revisited ideas that were too ambitious for the first game, and tapped into the studio’s well of creativity to make Aloy’s exploits even more exciting. For our latest cover story, we saw Forbidden West in action and learned firsthand about how the sequel is making some worthwhile changes to improve upon its predecessor. \nBetter Cinematics \nWe expect improved graphics with each new entry in a series, and so far, the footage shown for Forbidden West has been extremely impressive.

Although the hope after 2021 was a return to an in-person gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center (with even the city’s mayor crossing his fingers), the ongoing pandemic has nixed those plans. \nIn a statement to Venture Beat, posted below, the ESA confirmed that the coronavirus remains a major issue so it’s playing it safe for one more year:\nAs we all know, the pandemic is still very much a thing, especially with the Omicron variant running rampant. This isn’t the biggest shock in the world but still disappointing for fans, developers, and media hoping to reconnect in person this June. Since the pandemic started, E3 has been canceled outright in 2020 and the 2021 edition saw the event unfold through a series of livestreams and digital meetings held on the ESA’s website. If nothing else, it'll be interesting to see how the ESA iterates on last year's approach. \n[Source: Venture Beat]\nAre you disappointed about E3 going digital for one more year?

Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. \nDive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc\nJanuary 5, 2022\nMore specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. \nYou begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. \nFor more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review.

The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. \nWe also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. \nThe trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot.

          "description": "Nobody Saves The World, the upcoming action RPG from Guacamelee developers Drinkbox Studios, has a release date and it’s less than two weeks away. \nMore specifically, it will be released on January 18 and as previously announced, it will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via Windows 10 and Steam for $24.99. However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. \nIn Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. \nSpeaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. \nIf you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. \nNobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox.

With that in mind, what’s cooler than hitting a bunch of sick tricks set to a fresh soundtrack? Not much based on this latest trailer. \nAlthough the video doesn’t update players on when Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will drop, it does provide a glimpse into some of the cool moves you can pull off. Whether you’re tearing up the city on a pair of skates, a bike, or a skateboard, executing stylish rail grinds and nailing combos is not only fun but vital to progression. The crux of the game is tagging enough spots with your graffiti and out-tricking other crews to earn enough reputation to challenge them for territory control. Mastering traversal also matters for reaching hidden areas of the city that may contain secrets. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nIf this modern homage has you chomping at the bit to play it, developer Team Reptile promises in the video's description that it's “going in hard” to get Bomb Rush Cyberfunk out the door this year.

We’re treated to a minute and 40 seconds of hundreds of first-person screenshots (courtesy of the games’ impressive photo modes) and we’ve never wanted a first-person Spider-Man game more. \nOf course, it takes a couple of seconds for your eyes to adjust to the stop-motion effect but when it sings, it looks great. \n“Using Spider-Man PS5/Miles Morales PS5 photo mode, I decided to try and combine 850+ photos and make a first-person gameplay stop-motion,” ItIsSpid’s YouTube description reads. \nFor more, check out our reviews of these two games in Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man review and Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review.

          "description": "The musou genre is a long-spanning one with dozens of entries in it, but despite that, it has remained relatively niche in the grand scheme of things. \nHowever, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has helped buck that trend as Omega Force has revealed (on Twitter) that its Zelda musou, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, has shipped a whopping 4 million units since its release back in November of 2020. Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock. \n『#ゼルダ無双 厄災の黙示録』の全世界累計出荷本数が400万本を突破しました。プレイしていただいた皆さま、誠にありがとうございます。\nhttps://t.co/VV14JMDMeV#ゼルダの伝説 #Zelda\nJanuary 5, 2022\nSo while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. \nFor more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review. \nHave you played Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity?

So, it's only natural that Sucker Punch's visually stunning action/adventure game would find the same success as the samurai flicks that inspired it. Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. \nWe're thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!\npic.twitter.com/AQfyqviBlK\nJanuary 5, 2022\nA recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game's newest milestone: \"We're thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!\" \nIt's no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5's Director's Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer's Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director's Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:\n\"I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it's further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on.\"\nI've been playing through the Director's Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima's art direction and overall vibe.

Investigating the scene reveals a large driller protected by IO guards at a landmark called Mole Team: Omega. That's right, the Imagined Order (better known as IO) is back and it appears they drilled through the island.\nOdds are we'll see more IO troops on the island in the days and weeks ahead, likely culminating in a new story development. There's a chance it could tie into The Foundation unlockables countdown, which currently sits at 30 days.\nIf you want to check out the drilling site, make sure you bring a weapon, as IO will open fire the second they see you. Look for a tent and you'll find a large weapon cache. A launcher awaits on the far side of the dirt pile, so you should be able to make a quick getaway after getting the rare loot.\nI can't wait to see where Epic goes with this next.

It’s where Samsung announced its new line of 2022 TVs that will feature Stadia, Nvidia GeForce Now, and NFT support and integration, and it’s also where Nvidia, AMD, and Intel pulled back the curtains on some heavily-rumored GPUs. \nLet’s talk Nvidia. The company announced two new GPUs, the RTX 3…",

          "description": "Halo Infinite's shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation doesn't have much other than one cool item that ties into the return of the Fracture: Tenrai event.\nThe expensive item of the week is a 2,000 credit ($17.99) legendary mythic effect set called Enlightened Path, which adds pink rose petals to your Spartan's footsteps, slides, and spawns. Also included in this bundle is a white mask called Grand Play that can be applied to your nameplate, armor, vehicles, and weapons. I have to point out that the price for this bundle is ridiculous, especially since the player usually gets an armor set at this rate.\nThe more interesting offering this week is the Meditative State bundle, with the standout piece being the Imperial Crest helmet attachment for the Yoroi armor core earned in the Fracture: Tenrai event. This set also offers a cool coloring option called Expressive Soul which adds samurai-like highlights to the armor in gold and green. The bundle is rounded out with a triumphant stance called Mirror Tale, and an epic charm called Black Opal. This pack is 1,000 credits.\nIf you want to focus on your weapons and pick up another high-priced bundle, the Blacksteel Katana set is rather striking, adding a dragon scale effect to the MA40 assault rifle. You also get Black Cat weapon coloring, a Tiger Energy charm, and a Sun and Shadow icon to apply to weapons, vehicles, and more.\nThe item of the day is the Desert Sun bundle, offering the Ryuu visor for the Yoroi armor, and a dull green armor coating called Forgotten Sands.\nAll told, this week's offerings rank among the game's worst to date. The good news, though, is Fracture: Tenrai is back and we can keep working on that battle pass.",

          "description": "If you’re an Apex Legends fan that’s been wanting more out of the game’s lore, Respawn has released a new installment in its Stories from the Outlands series centered on fan-favorite Bangalore. \nFor those new to Stories from the Outlands, the series expands on the game’s lore by shining a narrative spotlight on its roster of Legends. Think of them as Respawn’s take on Blizzard’s Overwatch shorts. Gridiron sees Bangalore get torn between her responsibilities as a soldier and the relationship with her brother after the Battle of Gridiron. Clocking in at over eight minutes, the well-animated cinematic is a neat way of fleshing out of the game’s original favorites. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nYou can check out the previous Stories from the Outlands, which served as the debut for Seer, here. Meanwhile, Apex Legends continues to march forward with the recent introduction of its fourth map, Storm Point. As for broader Respawn news, president Vince Zampella was appointed the new head of the Battlefield franchise.",
