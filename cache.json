It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

          "description": "The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy can be thin, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. \"Nazis - I hate these guys!\" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: \"Nazis? I hate these guys!\" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.\nI guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.\n Read more",

          "description": "In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "Real ones know that the only XCOM spin off worth its salt is Hasbro’s 1999 play-by-mail banger First Alien Invasion, although that didn’t stop System Shock 2 studio Irrational from getting to work on an FPS set in the strategy series’ universe after being acquired by 2K in 2006. If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.\nMuch like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.\nRead more",

It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse.

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.\nRead more",

You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits.

Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. \r\n\n\r\nAnyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. \r\n\n\r\n\"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder,\" declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing.

As viewers, you'll be able to earn seasonal XP and free rewards by simply watching the upcoming streams on Twitch. But first, you'll have to do the important task of linking your EA account with Twitch to ensure all the rewards.\n\n\nEA FC 25: How to link your EA account with Twitch\n\n\nFor starters, you'll need to have a Twitch account, which is really easy to create. Once done, complete the following steps to connect your EA account with Twitch.\n\n\n\nGo to the Settings section in your EA account.\n\n\nChoose Connections.\n\n\nIn this section, you'll find a list of all third-party accounts that can be connected with your EA account.\n\n\nSelect the Link button beside Twitch.\n\n\nEnter the security code (only if you have an App Authenticator enabled).\n\n\nSign in to your Twitch account in the next step (opens automatically after you select Link).\n\n\nSelect Authorize, and then choose Link Accounts.\n\n\n\nImage via EA \n\n\nOnce done, a pop-up will appear, confirming that the link has been established successfully. Your EA account will now become enabled for Twitch Drops, and you'll be eligible for all applicable rewards. The FC Pro Season 1 is just the tip of the iceberg, as you can expect similar objectives to arrive in the future as well.\n\n\nAdditionally, you'll also get a free Mega Pack in EA FC 25 once you've linked your EA account with Twitch. If you want to connect your EA account with YouTube, the process is precisely the same. If you haven't linked your accounts, make sure to do it before November 2 to complete the FC Pro Season 1 Objective with ease. \n\nThe post How to link your EA FC 25 Ultimate Team account with Twitch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In what could be troubling news for the fake CIA and the real Activision, Black Ops 6 players have already uncovered a lot of secret information related to an unannounced and very promising Warzone map.\n\n\nOne of the fresh new additions to Black Ops 6 is a set of built-in puzzles for players to work through to solve a grander mystery, but, in true Black Ops fashion, they had to stick their noses in the wrong place. Still, I, for one, must admit they made a pretty damn cool discovery.\n\n\nVia a scoop shared by Eurogamer, we now know the new discovery is called \"Avalon.\" The new location was reached by players who implemented the CODcaster into a private match and picked Dockside Neighbourhood Lowtown as the spawn point. This allowed them to reach out-of-bounds areas, where they gained access to visit Avalon—and, yes, you can do it too!\n\n\nLong story short, Codename Avalon is huge, beautiful, and a true homage to Black Ops heritage. If you want a deeper breakdown of the surprisingly colorful shadowy map, YouTuber ZLaner's video does a great job of spilling the beans.\n\n\n\n\nWe already have a better layout of the map and the names of all of its points of interest, courtesy of the Reddit post below:\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, Codename Avalon will feature new locations, but will also have many classic Black Ops maps such as Firing Range and Hacienda.\n\n\nWhile the omni-movement mechanics are more than enough to make Black Ops 6 feel fresh enough to last another year, it's great to know even Warzone is getting a cool new refresh. \n\n\nYou can now play Black Ops 6 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nThe post Black Ops 6 players apparently leaked a new Warzone map appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
