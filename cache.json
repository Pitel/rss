          "description": "\"Time to make a comeback!\".\nThose of you who picked up the Switch during its launch period in the distant early days of 2017 may remember that, believe it or not, there were other games available at launch besides Breath of the Wild. One of those games was Super Bomberman R, which at the time was the title that broke the longest dry spell (nearly a decade) between releases in the long-running Bomberman franchise. Super Bomberman R sold relatively well considering the distinct niche it filled in the Switch library at the time, and after a rather ill-fated attempt to make a free-to-play version of that game for all platforms, Konami has now returned once again to the well with Super Bomberman R 2. At its core, this new release is little else than simply more Bomberman, but that’s hardly a bad thing when the gameplay feels this enjoyable.\nSuper Bomberman R 2 is fundamentally intended to be experienced as a party game, the kind of thing you play on a couch with a few friends while you shout unworthy things at each other as you repeatedly blow everyone up. Matches take place on a 13x11 grid viewed from a top-down perspective and the goal is simply to be the last (Bomber)man standing. You remove your opponents by placing timed bombs that send out plus-shaped blasts after a couple of seconds, though you have to be careful because you can easily blow yourself up if you don’t plan out your placement well.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll. \nRead more",

You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.\r\n\n\r\nGunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.\r\n\n \nRead more",

No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. \nYou play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?\nRead more",

Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.\nBut it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun.

Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet.

Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type \"player.setpos x 10\" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type \"setgravityscale 0\" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.\nSpace sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of \"player.setpos\" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. \nAnd after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.\nRead more",

          "description": "The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word \"immersive\". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. \r\n\n\r\nIn theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, \"the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.\nRead more",

I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.\nRead more",

I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.\nIt's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it \"diverting\" rather than \"entertaining\", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.\nRead more",

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.\nBut the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and… \nRead more",

Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.\nSo, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.\nRead more",

In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. \r\n\n\r\nThe game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself!

A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. \r\n\n\r\nMy first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like \"spam\", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming.

It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe.

But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.\nUnder The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to \"what [he's] been through\" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life.

Well, it will depend if you're the kind of person who consults our daily Wordle answer guides, as our first tool is, in fact, a Wordle Solver. It's a new experiment we're trying that's been put together by our guides and tech teams, and the aim is to help you arrive at those sometimes tricky Wordle answers without, necessarily, just resorting to looking up the answer. We'll see how it goes! And if you want to find out more about what it is and why we're doing it, read on below.\nRead more",

It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.\nRead more",

The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say \"playing\", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade.

Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. \nBut even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd).

          "description": "Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a \"game engine\" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?\nYou'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using \"the same engine\" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.\r\n \nRead more",

You must learn to run towards that titanic knight with the enormous shield, rolling between its colossal ankles, using its stature against it. You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a \"land on every planet\" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

As of this writing, it is unclear what these \"other adventures\" entail.\n\n\n“After careful thought and consideration, Stig Asmussen has decided to leave Respawn to pursue other adventures, and we wish him the best of luck,” an EA spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Veteran Respawn leaders will be stepping up to guide the team as they continue their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.”\n\n\n\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor were the first two installments in what Asmussen told IGN he hoped would be a trilogy, so today’s news makes this writer wonder if a third game is possible without Asmussen at the helm. \n\n\nDestructoid’s Chris Carter said about Jedi: Fallen Order that “you’re going to occasionally roll your eyes at a cheesy moment or groan at a technical issue, but Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order stands alone as an action game devoid of its Star Wars influence.” \n\n\nAs for Jedi: Survivor, Carter said “after finishing up Jedi Survivor and immediately cleaning up what I had missed for fun, I found myself wishing for a world where Respawn Entertainment focused all of its energy on single player games from here on out.”\n\nThe post Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen is leaving EA appeared first on Destructoid.",

It seems Square Enix will contribute more to that, as it just launched a sale showcasing its massive backlog, including Final Fantasy and Legend of Mana.\n\n\nThe TGS Sale is running from September 12 to September 25 and features deals across a variety of platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Some deals are exclusive to one or more of the aforementioned platforms, so we’ll highlight those below. \n\n\nThere are several really cool discounts offered this time around, the biggest, in my opinion, being the Kingdom Hearts All-in-One Package, on sale for $49.99 instead of the usual $99.99.

This one comes from Vic Game Studios, who plans to show it off at Tokyo Game Show 2023 later this month. For now we'll have to make do with an announcement trailer. At 15 seconds long, it's a teaser in every sense of the word.\n\n\nYou may not get an idea of how this particular RPG plays, but you can see character models strolling by in the video below.\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Quest\n\n\nHere's what we know about the story behind Breakers: Unlock the World so far. The original RPG takes players to the ends of the earth on a journey to the Library of God. It's there that all the knowledge of the world awaits. The announcement says the cel-shaded rendering will make you feel like you're \"playing an anime.\" Developer Vic Game Studios has some experience with that aspect. The team previously worked on Black Clover M: Rise of the Wizard King, a mobile game based on Yuki Tabata's Black Clover manga and anime.\n\n\nThere's no release date in place yet, but Breakers: Unlock the World is in the works for iOS, Android, and PC. Tokyo Game Show attendees will get to go hands-on at the Vic Game Studios booth this year. A playable build will be live beneath a massive LED display, so it'll be hard to miss. Tokyo Game Show 2023 goes down from September 21 to 24, and Vic promises more info on Breakers at a later date. \n\nThe post Breakers: Unlock the World revealed as new RPG from Black Clover mobile devs appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one is for the Super Famicom’s Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen, which the team of muscle fanatics has translated to Chō Aniki: Buff Battle Ballad.\n\n\nIf you’re not already savvy, the Chō Aniki series is a collection of wonderful kusoge (crap games). Each game is a ridiculous celebration of absurd body-building physique and normally comes packed with bizarre homoeroticism. The first game was released on the PC-Engine Super CD-ROM² System in 1992. A typical Chō Aniki is a horizontal scrolling shoot-’em-up, but the series has long dabbled with other genres. Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen is a 1995 Super Famicom fighting game.\n\n\nImage via Romhacking.net\n\n\nThe series hasn’t been strictly exclusive to Japan. Cho Aniki Zero was released over here on PSP. Meanwhile, the PlayStation version of Chō Aniki: Kyuukyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyou Otoko was ported to PS3 and PSP via the PSOne Classic lineup, but they were provided as-is. That is to say, they were not translated. However, they weren’t especially difficult to figure out for Anglophones.\n\n\nFor that matter, Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen wasn’t impossible to play for those who don’t know Japanese. However, it is nice to see it finally get a full translation, even if it’s not official. Considering how notorious the whole series is, it’s very surprising to me that this is the first time the series has seen a fan translation. Yet, that statement was made on the mod’s page, so I fact-checked it and found it to be true. Weird.\n\n\nThe Chō Aniki: Buff Battle Ballad comes to us from modders Pennywise, Ryusui, and FlashPV. The patch can be found right over here.\n\nThe post Oily muscle celebration game Chō Aniki: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen gets fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sony has just announced a new State of Play showcase, airing on September 14, 2023.\n\n\nThe Sony State of Play will air at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. The announcement doesn't confirm how long the show will last.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what to expect, Sony's saying there will be a focus on updates to previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles. It's set to have indie, PlayStation VR2, and major upcoming third-party games in the show too.\n\n\nThe state of PlayStation\n\n\nSpeculation can run rampant around this, so at the very least, it's nice to just have a concentrated 24-hour window of it.\n\n\nBy the sounds of it, we're going to be hearing about a set stable of known quantities. Looking back at recent State of Play showcases, it seems like we could catch anything from a Destiny 2 update or some Street Fighter 6 additions to, as Sony noted, some virtual reality.\n\n\nHopes might be set higher for some news on big third-party games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth or Death Stranding 2. Time will tell, I suppose. I'm personally curious to know if we'll hear anything on Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which was pushed out of this year and into next.\n\n\nEither way, it'll be a packed news day tomorrow with a Nintendo Direct also airing in the morning. It's like a little mini-E3 in September. And with Tokyo Game Show just around the corner, there's likely even more news set to hit before the Fall season of games gets underway.

          "description": "A new indie action RPG has been gaining traction on Kickstarter. Anima - Song From the Abyss is the latest game from Spanish-based studio Anima Project.\n\n\nThe group has been around for a while, forming in 2005 and having several published games, but Anima - Song From the Abyss is the studio's first Kickstarter and most ambitious project. Stylish action games like NieR Automata and open-world titles like The Witcher are influencing the title's direction. \n\n\nPrevious Anima titles were self-published and are solid games in their own right. Things like the budget were noticeable, but an interesting world and lengthy journey showed the team's passion. It's worth seeing how Song from the Abyss stacks up to NieR Automata given the first game's influence on the previous entries. \n\n\n\n\nOne notable difference is that Song From the Abyss is more colorful than its predecessors. The Kickstarter states Zelda as an influence, and it's noticeable with how saturated the environments are.\n\n\nBeyond that, Song of the Abyss' main appeal is opening the series up with a bigger budget game. The series always had an open-ended structure, but this expands the concept further. It's not open-world but ensures environments have a lot to explore.\n\n\nA notable feature returning from Gate of Memories is character switching on the fly. If executed well, stylish action game fans will be satisfied with stylish combos while alternating between protagonists Soren and Noein.\n\n\nSeeing new and interesting projects from small teams is always exciting. Anima Project is a three-person studio, and its previous efforts cut above what a team of that size can do with an action RPG. The good news is, the Kickstarter campaign has already cleared its initial funding goal. Hopefully, a bigger budget will help the team achieve its ambition and it will come out on time for its projected November 2024 release.\n\n\n\nThe post Kickstarter action-RPG Anima – Song From the Abyss draws on Zelda, DMC appeared first on Destructoid.",

You hire subordinates, punish sinners, and protect the rift between Hell and Earth. It’s a mix of deckbuilding and tower defense, where you need to create strategies based on your hand of cards.\n\n\n\n\nHeretic’s Fork employs that very particular art style that pairs drab colors and contrasts them with bright red. It touts both a rocking soundtrack by folks like Occams Laser. The developer also promises dark humor, and I’m already on board with the well-proven corporate Hell motif. \n\n\nThere’s a demo available, but the press release points out that the full version has a fully interactive desktop with secrets to unveil. I think they mean computer desktop. I’ve been really digging a lot of deckbuilder games recently, but if there’s one thing I enjoy more, it’s fictional operating systems. So, weirdly, that’s the part I’m most interested in. I probably would have grabbed Heretic’s Fork for review, but this week, in particular, is packed for me. I’m not sure why everyone decided to release everything in mid-September, but here we are.\n\n\nHeretic’s Fork is available now on PC.

          "description": "Way back in 2019, I did my first game review for Destructoid. It was for Doinksoft’s Gato Roboto. I wasn’t a huge fan. I thought that it played well but was derivative and insubstantial, largely paling in comparison to the games it took inspiration from. To be fair, however, that was one of Doinksoft’s first attempts as a studio, and imitating those that inspired you is a totally fair way to start out.\nWith that out of the way, however, we have Gunbrella. Now, this is something I can get behind. Or get under. While there is still some obvious inspiration showing through in many places, Gunbrella makes it obvious that it’s a game that started with a simple concept and grew from there. It's the best, most organic way to make a game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_403807\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"64…",

          "description": "Update (9/13/23): Following yesterday's news, Unity has clarified and already walked back some key points. In a statement to Axios, Unity exec Marc Whitten said fees will not be charged for demos unless they are a part of a download that includes the full game.\n\n\nAdditionally, Unity looks to have walked back one issue around multiple fees. Unity now says it will only charge for an \"initial installation,\" per Axios, after regrouping to discuss the issue. However, an extra fee will charge if a user installs a game on a second device; once on a home PC and again on Steam Deck, for example. Whitten also says that developers will not be on the hook for fees through services like Xbox Game Pass, but rather, it would be the distributor (a.k.a. Microsoft).\n\n\nOur original story follows.\n\n\nThis morn…",

          "description": "A new Nintendo Direct livestream is set to air, and quite soon at that. This one's a 24-hour notice, with September 2023 Nintendo Direct airing tomorrow on September 14.\n\n\nThe show will run for roughly 40 minutes, containing information focused on \"Nintendo Switch games releasing this winter.\" It'll air on Nintendo's channels at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET.\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, there were some rumors swirling about a September Nintendo Direct leading up to this announcement. But it's nice to see that the usual pre-Fall show has been locked in. We've usually seen a show around this time, coinciding with Tokyo Game Show, which is running September 21 through 24 this year.\n\n\nLet the speculation begin\n\n\nSo, at this point, there's little else to do but speculate. Though Nintendo's specifying a winter window, I'm sure some fans are hoping to see some massive new announcements, especially after the reports out of Gamescom.\n\n\nThe upcoming fall slate is a little interesting for the Switch. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet just got its first batch of DLC in The Teal Mask last night, with The Indigo Disk still on the way. A 2D Mario game is on the way with Wonder, alongside a remake of a classic in Super Mario RPG. Plus, there are some potential hits lurking around, like Fashion Dreamer and a new WarioWare.\n\n\nI'm personally hoping for a slew of surprising indie games. While this year's had some huge blockbusters, I'd dig something small and intriguing I could pick away at on my Switch. It's been sitting on the sidelines since Tears of the Kingdom for me, and could use an out-now surprise to encourage me to return.\n\n\nWe'll find out what Nintendo's winter has in store for us in tomorrow's Direct at 10 a.m. ET / 7 a.m. PT.\n\nThe post Next Nintendo Direct presentation arrives tomorrow, September 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was turned onto it back in the day by the relentless enthusiasm of Destructoid grizzled veteran Jonathan \"Grizzled Veteran\" Holmes. With Unity making an impressive attempt to implode a massive section of the indie development community, Will Brierly has decided it's time to stick the needle in and get sucking as much cash out of enthusiastic soda drinkers as possible.\n\n\nVia the Soda Drinker Pro website, Will Brierly has announced that beginning January 1, 2024, a diabolical new monetization scheme will be implemented.\n\n\n\nHistorically, Soda Drinker Pro functioned on a one-time purchase model.

          "description": "The console wars continue, and it looks like Xbox is enjoying a boost in the UK. It turns out sales of the Series S and Series X have increased by 76%, based on week-on-week figures up to September 2.\n\n\nThat's according to a report from Gamesindustry.biz. The data itself comes from GfK – a German market research company – which says that the Series X in particular enjoyed a 46% jump in sales across the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for this has been attested to the recent 1TB model of the Xbox console. The Series S 1TB edition released at the start of September and, according to GfK spokesperson Dorian Bloch, accounted for 24% of all the Xbox systems sold at the start of the month.\n\n\nThere's another factor as well...\n\n\nOf course, it isn't just a new model that's responsible for this increase in sales. It's been suggested that Starfield – which launched fully on September 6 – is partially responsible for this boost. \n\n\nGiven that the game was available to people who pre-ordered the Premium Edition from September 1, it's entirely plausible that many people in the UK went out and bought an Xbox in preparation.\n\n\nAs we all know, Starfield is an Xbox exclusive and was made available through Game Pass from day one. It's easily one of the most anticipated releases of this gaming generation, much to the chagrin of PlayStation and Nintendo owners.\n\n\nReviews for Starfield have been largely positive, though many have noticed the usual assortment of bugs. It's a Bethesda game, after all. But a 76% jump in sales across the UK suggests that Microsoft making it an Xbox exclusive was worth it financially.\n\nThe post Sales of Xbox Series X|S jump 76% in the UK appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A few months before release, it was revealed that Bethesda would be partnering with AMD for Starfield, likely leaving Nvidia and Intel users worried. Now, Team Green has pushed out a new driver update that is said to boost the game by an average of 5%.\n\n\nThat's according to a recent blog post from Nvidia itself. The long and the short of it is the company is rolling out an over-the-air (OTA) update for the RTX 30 and RTX 40 series. The post describes it as a \"Resizable BAR profile for Starfield which increases performance\" for its modern graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone playing the game on PC with one of the above GPU generations should hopefully see some improvements to overall performance.\n\n\nThe Colony Wars vs the Graphics Card Wars\n\n\nGiven that Starfield has been better optimized for AMD hardware, the likes of Nvidia and Intel will likely have a harder time meeting expectations.\n\n\nThis does appear to be the case as noted in the above video from Digital Foundry. In the analysis, Starfield running on an Nvidia RTX 2070 SUPER struggles to reach 60fps. By comparison, Cyberpunk 2077 is able to achieve above 70fps with the same hardware and with ray tracing on.\n\n\nEven the Nvidia RTX 4060 is unable match the performance output of AMD's own RX 7600. The former seems to have problems even reaching 40fps, while the latter more than outdoes its competitor in terms of framerate.\n\n\nHopefully this latest OTA update from Team Green should see some improvements. Future benchmark tests will at least be able to give the lowdown. If you're struggling to get the driver update OTA, Nvidia's own Sean Pelletier has some advice on how to force the update.\n\nThe post Latest Nvidia driver improves Starfield performance on RTX 30 and 40 series appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Although it was met with some criticisms when it was released in February of 2022, Dying Light 2 is a worthy follow-up to its 2015 predecessor. However, since developer Techland updated the game recently, the horror sequel has been facing the wrath of the review bombers.\n\n\nIf you take a look at the Steam page for Dying Light 2, you'll see that the scores now say \"Mixed,\" with the review chart showing the negative reception the game's been getting recently.\n\n\n\n\nMany have expressed anger at the Summer Time patch, which added new weapon animations, bug fixes, and more. However, it also introduced microtransactions in the form of Dying Light Points. These are purchasable with real money and can be used to acquire add-ons. As the Steam reviews show, this has not gone down well with fans.\n\n\nTechland responds\n\n\nAs is usually the case with such controversies, the studio has issued a statement regarding these \"frustrations.\" The developer says it has been listening to feedback and has started working on a \"couple of solutions proposed by the community.\"\n\n\nOne such example is a second look at the \"mechanics of adding an option to purchase individual items from the existing bundles.\" Whether there will truly be a 180 on the implementation of DL Points remains to be seen.\n\n\nThe fact that the message from Techland goes on to remind people of the \"several bundles in the store that can be bought for less than 500 DL Points that you can grab now\" sort of implies they're here to stay.

You can now play as Shoto Todoroki, Eijiro Kirishima, and Mina Ashido from the anime's Class 1-A. Todoroki is available by himself, while the other two are included in a bundle. Additionally, characters can now create an Ice Wall, in addition to using the Deku Smash. \n\n\nImage via Epic Games\n\n\nTodoroki, Kirishima, and Ashido are available on Fortnite's Item Shop. Todoroki himself comes with two costumes and is 1,500 VBucks. There's a bundle with him and three other items, such as the Cold-Hot Hitters and U.A. Uniform weapon skin, for 2,400 VBucks. \n\n\nAshido and Kirishima are 1,500 VBucks separately or 2,800 VBucks together. That 2,800 VBucks bundle also comes with the Cultural Festival Dance, Red Riot Thrashers, Red Riot Shield, and Acid Axe. \n\n\nFortnite players can also find the Ice Wall ability, in addition to the Deku Smash as an item pick-up. You can score them easily from the All Might supply drop, which has the former hero's face on the balloon. The Ice Wall can protect your friends or slip up players as an offensive attack. \n\n\nAdditionally, there are quests focused on My Hero Academia. These include finding All Might supply drops, damaging foes with the Deku Smash, and causing fire damage to structures around the world. If you finish enough of these quests, you'll gain an instant level-up.\n\n\nDeku, Bakugo, and Uraraka are currently not on the Fortnite Item Shop at the time of writing, but they'll may join the lineup soon if you missed them the first time.

The demo is now available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. In addition, all progress made can be transferred to the full release.\n\n\n\n\nFor longtime fans of the Disgaea franchise, the new trailer for Vows of the Virtueless includes the return of Tsunami Bomb’s “The Invasion From Within,” which was included as the trailer music for the original Disgaea: Hour of Darkness back in 2007. To hit its fandom over the head with a nostalgia meteor this close to release, NIS America must have a lot of confidence in Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless.\n\n\nIn the latest entry in the Disgaea franchise, we follow Fuji and Pirilika as they seek to return the bushido code to the demonic realm of Hinomoto. As is to be expected from the series, there are a vast number of character classes to pick from, along with new features such as Item Reincarnation, Jumbification, and Hell Mode! Plus, with the inclusion of online ranked battles, it seems there’s much to do this go around.\n\n\nDisgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is set to release on October 3 for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. You can download the demo today to test out the new features and, as mentioned above, transfer any progress made to the full version of the game when it launches.\n\nThe post <strong>NIS America launches demo for Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless</strong> appeared first on Destructoid.",

It captured my imagination in a way I haven't felt in games since I was a kid.\nI wondered why this was until I thought about how it handles romance. When I shipped Karlach and Lae'zel together, I compared Baldur's Gate 3 to dating sims rather than other RPGs and everything clicked.

          "description": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre launches its next update today, September 12, 2023, and players irritated by those long lobby queues may see some relief. \n\n\nPatch notes for today's quick fixes add a lot of little tweaks that add up to big changes. Notably, Gun and Sumo Digital took out the lobby timer that was added in a previous update following community backlash. Sumo intended to give players more time to fill lobbies, but the patch notes seems to acknowledge it backfired: \n\n\n\"The community generally disliked this change, and we have therefore reverted it back to the standard 3 minutes.\"\n\n\nThe seemingly endless lobby timer starting and stopping was occasionally my experience, too. There's quite a few threads hanging out on Reddit and Steam complaining about waits and changes to the system. Now, you'll wait three minutes, and the Texas Chain Saw Massacre's community lead, Matt Shotcha, noted player feedback on a few occasions. \n\n\nImage by Gun\n\n\n\"Maybe they can add a prompt or sound if 6 of 7 players ready up or it cuts the timer to a minute or 30 seconds,\" wrote one player. Shotcha responded it was \"something we can consider for the future.\"  \n\n\nOther fixes include the funky matchmaking queue with active players continuing to countdown long after everyone readied up. This happened a few times within my own pre-made groups. But now, assuming everyone selects ready, you won't have to wait for the full-timer to expire to find another lobby. \n\n\nAs for the rest, they're mostly things that didn't impede in my matches, but are noteworthy. Bone scraps now limit players to three uses, and the car battery begins Texas Chain Saw matches fully charged. The full list is worth a read, even if you aren't adding new victims or family to the roster. Queue hiccups aside, I've had a blast in it, terrifying grandpa jokes and all. \n\nThe post Texas Chain Saw Massacre update axes the long lobby timer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It looks like Apple is leaning more into the gaming market than ever with the iPhone 15 Pro. At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that some big titles will be running natively on the new device, including Resident Evil 4 Remake, Resident Evil Village, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding.\n\n\nThis is a massive deal because this will be the first time a mainline Assassin’s Creed title will run on iPhone without the help of cloud streaming. This could be a significant improvement over the latest generation of iPhones, especially for those looking to play the biggest titles on-the-go, but don’t want to invest in a fully (or partial) portable console like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not the first time a console quality game has been natively run on mobile phones, however. An example of this would be Fortnite, which has been running the same experience as on consoles on mobile since its launch in 2018.\n\n\nSo, the viability of this announcement will largely depend on how the iPhone 15 Pro’s battery life holds up while playing as an assassin or skulking the village in search of your missing daughter in Resident Evil Village.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Assassin’s Creed Mirage is set to release for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on October 5, the game will not launch for iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max until the first half of 2024. As for Resident Evil 4 Remake, Resident Evil Village, and Death Stranding, those are due to arrive later this year. It would seem that, if Apple has anything to say about it, 2024 could be a red letter year. \n\nThe post Resident Evil Village, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, and more coming to iPhone 15 Pro appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has consistently been a fan of airing Nintendo Directs during September, with the usual September Directs being some of the most exciting of the year. And the company will continue that streak in 2023 as it has announced a Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, September 14.\nThe company revealed this on Twitter today, stating that the direct will run for \"roughly 40\" minutes at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET on September 14. \nTune in on Sept. 14 at 7 a.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused on #NintendoSwitch games releasing this winter.\nhttps://t.co/tUb8vyZNfx pic.twitter.com/WJcQ5ZQl1b\nSeptember 13, 2023\nAs for what to expect, there's a lot of unknowns circling this Direct. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That's the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. \nDetective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it's likely we'll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There's plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we're hoping to learn more about the company's 2024 plans. Considering \"this winter\" dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.\nOn that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we'll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. \nThis Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. \nWhat do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct?

While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. \n\nWhile details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. \nAs for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.\nResident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin's Creed Mirage is Game Informer's current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5. \nRead Game Informer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review here, and then check out our thoughts on Resident Evil Village.

The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. \nLike most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19.

Ahead of the game's release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. \nToday's trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao's second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nShang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as \"a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona.\" Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster's other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. \nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game.

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke.

          "description": "Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.\nPer Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. \n\"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it,\" Baird tells EW. \"It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story.\"\nStray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here. \n[Source: Entertainment Weekly]",

Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. \nTokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24.

          "description": "E3 2023 was canceled back in March, and PAX organizer ReedPop was in charge of organizing the event, the first of a multi-year contract. However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.\nAccording to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. \n“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”\nReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then. \n[Source: GameIndustry.biz]",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.\nNitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. \nMegan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,\" Fox says in a press release. \"It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. \n\n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.",

As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. \nPublisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.\nIn terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. \nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.",

          "description": "The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.\nIn a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. \n“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man,\" Pieces writes. \"We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”\nThe studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. \n\n\nAlone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.\nMore than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.\nIn the fall of 2020, my wife and I lost a baby…",

This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
