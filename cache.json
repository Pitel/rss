Splish-splashing its way onto Switch in stunning watercolour is Dordogne, a nostalgic kayak trip down the metaphorical river of life – and also down the literal river of Dordogne in the south of France. Umanimation, the production company behind the game, specialises in “transmedia universes”, its previous works including a web series and a VR short film. This, its first video game project, combines the airy sweeps of gorgeous watercolours with all the button-pressing fun of gaming - and does so to deliver a deeply touching rumination on loss.\nThe story focuses on Mimi and her paternal grandmother Nora. When Mimi is in her early 30s, Nora passes away leaving behind a letter telling Mimi to visit her old house in the French region of Dordogne. Mimi’s father Fabrice has been feuding with Nora for as long as Mimi can remember. She doesn’t know why, but it dates back to a childhood summer visit to her grandmother’s house. She has hazy, happy memories of the holiday, but also suffers from a mental block. Thus is established an emotive mystery wrapped up in halcyon, sun-drenched memories.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So now Hellsinger offers a poppier experience with a new DLC letting you perform violence to the sounds of Gorillaz, Depeche Mode, Icona Pop, and more.

          "description": "We got a proper look at Starfield (which my brain autocorrects to \"Garfield\" every single time I read it) on Sunday thanks to a dedicated 45 minute long presentation that showcased the game's various systems, planets and characters in granular detail. 45 minutes is a long time to devote to one video game, you could argue. Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? \nAnyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.\nRead more",

We've covered more mid-range models before, but today we have something a bit different: a truly mainstream graphics card that delivers excellent 1080p performance at less than £200, plus nice extras like ray-tracing hardware, FSR 2 image upscaling and a modern media encoder for streaming and recording gameplay. \nI'm talking about the AMD Radeon RX 6600, which is available in the popular Sapphire Pulse configuration for £180 plus £8 shipping over at Overclockers UK - with a free copy of the Resident Evil 4 remake. This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago.

          "description": "After its big reveal at Summer Game Fest on Thursday, the internet has not taken kindly to Ubisoft's new Prince Of Persia game. There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a \"true\" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake. \nRead more",

Having spent a few hours with third-person co-op shooter Remnant 2, I reckon it's shaping up to be exactly those two things. It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care. From what I've played, it's more about being the looter shooter for those who care about fine-tuning the consistency of the numbers they're able to extract from their foes.\nRead more",

I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.\nThe countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, \"five, four, three!\", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of \"Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass\". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ahead of the launch of its Steam Next Fest demo next week, I've been playing a substantial early build of Mimimi Games' latest stealth strategy game, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. \nAs you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th. \nRead more",

An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk.

To skip to the end: it looks a lot like past Paydays, inasmuch as it's a co-op first-person shooter that's less about clever breaking and entering and more about mowing down waves of cops. \r\n\nThe trailer also came with a release date: September 21st.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like lots of people in the RPS Treehouse right now, I've been squeezing in bits of Diablo 4 around the various Summer Game Fest streams happening this week. I'm having a decent, if mildly monotonous time so far, mostly because I haven't unlocked all my Druid's abilities just yet, but I'm keen to keep going with it, mostly because I just like turning into a bear and a wolf every three seconds to whack some evil skelly boys, innit. When I was logging off the other day, though, I had a fleeting glance at Diablo 4's shop. Not to actually buy anything, I should stress. I'm not one for cosmetics in any shape or form. But I just wanted to see what ludicrous things it was trying to sell me for real human money. And one item for sale was, of course, some fancy horse armour, and it cost six English pounds and thirty nine pence. £6.39! For a mangey rope bridle and a bone dagger on its side! (You can see it in the header image up top there). Ridiculous, I exclaimed, and promptly shut down my PC. \nThe next morning, I was talking about this daft bit of armour with the RPS Treehouse when Alice0 suddenly introduced me to the weird and wonderful world of cheap horse games on Steam. After all, why spend upwards of £6 on a pointless cosmetic item when you could feasibly put that money toward 6 whole horse games that have actually dozens of horses in them? So join me as we discover how many horse games you can buy on Steam for the same price as Diablo 4's horse armour. \nRead more",

Civilization: Beyond Earth, Galactic Civilizations 3, Age Of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend made 2014 an incredibly strong year for strategy games, but nowadays, who really still plays these older entries?\nI don't mean to sound derisive. It's a sombre truth. At 233 hours, I've put more time into Endless Legend than any other 4X strategy game in my Steam library, and loved every minute of it. To this day it's still the best in the genre when it comes to sparking the imagination of my chronically fantasy-loving brain. The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly. It's a simply splendid game. The question is whether it's still worth playing today.\n Read more",

In 2018, it was caught up in the dispute between the original film's producer and writer, causing publisher Gun Media to halt all DLC plans. In 2020, the game's dedicated servers were killed, but online play limped on via peer-to-peer matchmaking.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Some of the best Star Wars tales came from these games\nThe video team at Destructoid has been busy cooking up some new stuff for the community, and I'm pleased to present the \"History of\" series, and it's starting out with a bang! Brett Medlock and company are looking at Star Wars action games: which have a long and storied history dating back to early consoles and the PC platform.\nHaving experienced Star Wars games basically since they started taking hold on the NES, I've seen an unprecedented amount of massive hits mixed with poor decision-making across the board. Star Wars is so massive that Lucas and Disney respectively could not and cannot currently contain it, and licensing projects out to other studios is just a cold reality. But as we moved out of the relatively safe zone of '90s console platformers and PC flight sims, things got a little dicier. If you're curious, yes, the flood of prequel games is covered in the video (that all starts roughly 3:00 in!).\nThankfully, there are tons of bright spots like Dark Forces (which evolved into Jedi Knight, augmenting itself to the very spine of the IP itself) and KOTOR to help carry on the \"Star Wars video game\" name as it were. A lot of that light and legacy also shone through for some of the modern hits, like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. There is still plenty of room for fun and innovative Star Wars titles, so long as creatives are willing to take risks.\nBut don't just take it from me, watch the video below!\nA visual history of Star Wars action games\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjdkNo2oBs\nThe post Star Wars action games have a fascinating history: watch it unfold in our new video series! appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Darkstalkers is Back, exactly as you remember it\nStreet Fighter 6 might have only just gotten out of the gate, but already the mod community is hard at work on bringing an array of fun 'n' silly new skins to the 18 World Warriors of Capcom's smash sequel. And we're absolutely getting off on the right foot, with these skins that turn poster boys Luke and Jamie in Darkstalkers' very own night slashers, Morrigan and Felicia.\nAs created by artist and modder Remy2FANG, the new skins bring the spirit of Darkstalkers to the Street Fighter 6 universe, just as we all wanted. Luke ditches his horrendous cuffed pants for the succubus' sultry ensemble, while Jamie shows off more than his usual amount of cheek as melee moggy Felicia.\nThey both look cute af, is what I'm saying.\nhttps://twitter.com/Remy2FANG/status/1668445962791174144?s=20\nThe Street Fighter 6 skins are available over at the Nexus Mods hub, and represent just a sliver of the alt costumes that the talented mod community will no doubt be sending into battle over the coming years. Of course, it goes without saying that modding titles is a strictly unofficial deal, and players will want to make sure that they know exactly what they're doing before they go poking around in the game's source folders.\nEvery Street Fighter title since SFIV has found itself awash in awesome creations, often referencing characters and worlds from the gaming universe. It will be rad to see what these talented creators come up with next. Street Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 mods see Luke & Jamie cute-it-up as Morrigan and Felicia appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pre-orders open July 31, and it’s expected to ship 3-4 months after that.\nWhen I recently covered Mr. Run and Jump’s announcement, I mentioned that it originally started as a homebrew project before being expanded to a modern game. In that article, I opined that I’d rather play the original version. I’m getting my wish here, and I’m almost embarrassed about it. Obviously, Atari had this planned before I opened my big mouth, but I’m not used to having a demand actually met.\nMr. Run and Jump is largely how it sounds.

          "description": "Explore Apollo's backstories on new hardware\nThe Ace Attorney series is getting another collection, this time focusing on the second trilogy of attorney adventures. Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy will bring more of the series to modern platforms in early 2024.\nAnnounced at last night's Capcom Showcase, the trilogy collection will contain three Ace Attorney titles. Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirt of Justice are all included in the compilation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4M9VfoAC68\nThe games will be in full HD, and include seven language options as well as voice recordings. Not much more has been shown about it, other than that it brings the three entries together into one bundle. I imagine it will be packaged the same as the original trilogy collection was.\nAnd justice for all\nThis compilation is a very intriguing collection of games. While the original trilogy followed the first three games, showing lawyer Phoenix Wright's early career and journey, this second trilogy switches gears and looks towards Apollo Justice.\nApollo is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm really happy to see his trilogy get a collection. These games were part of the 3DS catalogue, so seeing them escape the shutdown is nice. As far as the actual games, I feel like reception on them is a bit more mixed compared to the original Ace Attorney trilogy. That said, I personally enjoy these entries quite a bit. Spirit of Justice actually contains one of my favorite cases in the entire Ace Attorney series!\nHopefully, having three collections at this point—the original, the Apollo games, and the Great Ace Attorney duology—means a new entry is a possibility. If Layton can stage a comeback, so can Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, and the gang.\nThe post Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy heads to PC and consoles in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The FTC filed suit against Microsoft back in December 2022, but the case is still yet to be heard in court.\nThe FTC has asked for an injunction preventing the sale from taking place be filed no later than June 15, and that said injunction remain in place until the court makes its decision later this summer.\nIn a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Microsoft president Brad Smith writes: \"We welcome the opportunity to present our case in federal court. We believe accelerating the legal process in the U.S. will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market.\"\nThe FTC continues to build its case against the proposed sale ahead of August's hearing. The commission is expected to present arguments that Microsoft's ownership of the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft studio will create something of a monopoly within the industry, limiting player choice and confining popular brands to MS own platforms. Microsoft has repeatedly denied that this is the intent behind its proposed purchase.\nPretrial briefs are expected to take place in July, with the court officially opening August 2.\nThe post FTC requests injunction to prevent Microsoft/Activision sale from closing early appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some of you will be excited, while some of you may be holding back judgment. In any case, it's on a lot of people's lips, and the game may have its release date already.\nAs spotted by Twitter user ResiEvilCentral, Australian website Gaming Gorilla has made Silent Hill 2 available for pre-order, at a cost of $89 AUS (about $60 US). However, the most interesting part about this listing is that it says the \"expected release date\" for the remake down as September 29, 2023.\nNow, given that neither Konami nor the developer has said when it's likely to launch, where Gaming Gorilla got this information is definitely interesting. Last we heard, Bloober Team denied SH2 was ready for release. The fact that both Steam and the PlayStation Store also do not list a release date means this could well have been in error.\nhttps://twitter.com/resievilcentral/status/1668311447212785692\nEither that or someone somewhere has access to information the rest of aren't privy to. As of this moment, there is no official release date for the game, so it's entirely likely that this is just a rumor or someone has made a mistake. At the time of writing, the \"leaked\" release date is still on the retailer's website. However, it's best not to get your hopes up until the studio/publisher either confirm or deny these latest developments.\nSilent Hill enjoys a pretty solid legacy, though it's been lying dormant for too long. The second installment, released in 2001, has gone down as one of the most important survival horror games of all time. Given this, it's not surprising that so many are looking forward to the remake. Whether Bloober Team can pull it off remains to be seen at this stage.\nThe post Retailer may have leaked Silent Hill 2 launch date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The digital funland will open in June and is a celebration of the veteran studio's legacy of games and franchises.\nVery little has been offered in the way of details, but Capcom Town will feature \"a digital museum and other buildings\" which one would assume will be filled with artwork, marketing materials, write-ups, and trailers from franchises such as Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and many more. We will likely see areas based on Capcom's arcade roots, hopefully offering nods to titles such as Strider, Side Arms, Gun.Smoke, and maybe even Cadillacs & Dinosaurs... Ok, now I'm just being unrealistic.\nCapcom is genuinely one of the industry greats, and while the past decade has certainly seen the studio stumble on more than one occasion, the developer seems to have been back on track since the 2018 launch of Monster Hunter World, which has led to a string of quality, successful releases.

          "description": "Turning (Ghost) Tricks\nThe Summer Game Fest presentations are all but complete, but there are still several publishers preparing to do their own thang with their own live streams — And in just an hour from now, Capcom will open up the airways with its own Capcom Showcase presentation, filled with news and updates.\nWe already know that the veteran developer is preparing to show off several upcoming releases, including action RPG Dragon's Dogma 2, dinosaur battler Exoprimal, and the remastered spook-fest Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. In addition, we can perhaps expect post-launch news for the recently released Street Fighter 6, and perhaps an update on the \"Separate Ways\" DLC for smash hit Resident Evil 4. There's a lot of possibility, so it should be a fun little stream.\nThe Capcom Showcase live stream kicks off at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The stream won't even take up too much of your time, as it is expected to run a short 30 minutes. Check out the show for yourself in the embed below, and we'll be sure to bring you all of the news right here on Destructoid.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRiEUtXKozU\nThe post Come watch the Capcom Summer Showcase live stream with us! appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The heart of the franchise was not lost in translation\nMaking the jump from a two-screen device to a single-screen experience can be a tricky proposition. Some games, like The World Ends with You, lose something in the conversion. Others, like Layton’s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaire’s Conspiracy Deluxe Edition, discover life can effortlessly go on with just one screen. Most games have a logical path forward moving from the Nintendo DS/3DS to modern hardware.\nBut Etrian Odyssey is not like most games. This franchise is categorically connected to the dual-screen era of gaming that it’s almost hard to imagine how it could possibly work on Switch.

          "description": "Who Goes There?\nDuring yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, publisher Secret Mode released a creepy teaser trailer for a new horror title, Still Wakes the Deep, which is currently in development for PC and Gen9 consoles.\nDeveloped by The Chinese Room in Unreal 5, Still Wakes the Deep sees an offshore oil rig in the North Sea under siege by a mysterious and terrifying entity. It's 1975, a storm is raging, and something has come aboard the Beira D rig. With lines of communication severed and escape seemingly impossible, there may be no other option than to face terror itself if you are to survive this horrific incident.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI74BV20B7g\nThe teaser trailer offers little in the way of gameplay and concept, but we do get to see some very impressive visuals, as well as catch a glimpse of the foreboding, isolating atmosphere of the title. It all feels very The Thing, which is obviously a more than suitable comparison for '70s isolation horror. The Chinese Room is no stranger to horror, having developed titles such as Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Dear Esther, and with the power of Unreal 5 in its hands, Still Wakes the Deep could eventually prove to be the studio's magnum opus.\nStill Wakes the Deep is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Still Wakes the Deep brings ’70s horror to an offshore oil rig appeared first on Destructoid.",

But apparently, that’s important in Star Wars: Outlook – I mean Star Wars: Outlaws – which was shown off by Massive Entertainment as part of Ubisoft Forward 2023.\nYou play as Kay Vess, a thief who has a bounty on their head. She sneaks around and sucker-punches some dudes who don’t look like her. Her furry axolotl can be commanded by her to fetch weapons in the midst of combat. It’s actually pretty cute. Very merchandize-able.\nhttps://youtu.be/c7K2TA0bBpY\nShe then takes off into the open world. Yeah, it’s open world. Normally, this isn’t much of a bulletpoint, but for Ubisoft, it’s a warning. So, this whole thing is just accomplishing a side-quest delivery, and then returning to the quest giver. She then takes off in her ship, which, again, is the most unimaginative-looking ship I’ve seen in a while. There’s some space combat. Quest complete.\nI mean, it looks nice. It sounds nice. It’s very Star Wars-y, which I mean as a compliment. Still, though, the whole vertical slice of gameplay is so Ubisoft that it gives me pause. A lot of the features of Star Wars: Outlook, uh, Outlaws look pretty cool. I just don’t want to be using them to accomplish a bunch of shallow, repetitive nothing missions.\nWe’ll see for sure just how it turns out when Star Wars: Outlaws release sometime in 2024.\nThe post Star Wars: Outlaws gameplay trailer demonstrates its merchandisablity appeared first on Destructoid.",

I would have been more excited for a game, but that’s just me. This is not that. It is not a sequel to Blood Dragon. It's a show that is coming to Netflix this Fall.\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon was a standalone expansion to Far Cry 3 that, in a rare move for Ubisoft, looked like it was made by people having fun with their work. Unfortunately, it looks like Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix isn’t really… that. It’s not looking very parody ‘80s cyberpunk.\nhttps://youtu.be/LgAUYJ_gglg\nBut! Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix does look kind of fun. There are Easter eggs, butts, and speed lines. There are some rainbows. It also looks like there’s going to be some Assassin’s Creed wrapped in there. Could be good. I’ve got no reason to believe otherwise.\nI mean, I would still prefer that Ubisoft just makes another dumb-fun game, but I suppose that might be asking too much.

The first of these was an animated trailer, which offers a pretty good time if you're a fan of the new design for the titular prince.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxP9Mx3AdEk\nOf course, cinematic and animated trailers in the video game world are a dime a dozen. Fortunately, the second trailer demonstrates the proper gameplay of this title, which gives us a bit more to chew on. Director Mournir Radi said The Lost Crown has a \"semi-open world,\" which I still can't get over.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3qsC8T42Ag\nThe most intriguing part of this trailer is the showcase of time-based powers reminiscent of the original Sands of Time. While this gimmick might be in vogue at the moment, Prince of Persia at least has precedent for it. So far, it looks like time-based mechanics will factor heavily into both the combat of The Lost Crown and exploration of its not quite linear world. It's not a full open world, that I can assure you.\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown and its semi-open, definitely not closed world will launch on January 17, 2024.

Preparing for these shows is a hugely expensive endeavor, but it's still surprising to see Sony may not be on deck this year.\nOf course, the publisher did just roll out over an hours' worth of trailers in a recent State of Play, and there is still Paris Games Week and the Tokyo Game Show to go before the year is out, so PlayStation is sure to put in a new appearance come fall, even if it is taking time out for the remainder of the summer.\nGamescom 2023 — with or without PlayStation — takes place at Koelnmesse, Germany between August 23-27.

Except Star Trucker is a more literal version of that. It’s more like if you jammed Elite Dangerous into Euro Truck Simulator 2 and then removed all the superfluous bits. For example, I see no mention of space pirates or combat of any kind within the walls of this press release. Nor in the twangy trailer.\nhttps://youtu.be/0ByyuI-azZs\nWhat I do see is the kind of approach I love. There’s this slowly building philosophy in the sub-mainstream game development community where tactile gameplay is beginning to slide in. Specifically, when it comes to driving games, there’s a push to make you feel more like a person in a vehicle rather than the vehicle itself. That means having to get out and perform maintenance or take care of your meat-vessel needs. This is in contrast to games like Euro Truck Simulator 2, where you have no real existence outside of your truck.\nWe're star truckin' round the stars\nThe trailer doesn’t show off a lot of gameplay, but it does depict things like patching holes in your truck. It looks like you activate things within your truck by actually looking at them and interacting. Moreover, during the sequence where the player fixes the exterior of their space-truck, you get a glimpse of the interior, and it seems to be more than just a cockpit.\nThat’s more-or-less just speculation. What Star Trucker does promise is hauling jobs, goods of the legal and less-than-legal variety, and customization of your space-rig. There’s also a CB Radio that allows you to “interact with a fully voiced cast of characters for an authentic trucking experience.”\nPC is the only announced platform for Star Trucker, while the release window is for the wide-open road of 2024.\nThe post Star Trucker is assembling the space convoy in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.\nThe collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.\n\n\nThe Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.\nApollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...\nIt is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.\nOur team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.\nThank you for your continued support.\n-The Pragmata Development Team\nPragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a \"near-future dystopian world on the moon,\" according to Capcom.

The reveal shows smuggler Kay Vess sneaking and shooting her way through a galaxy far far away. There's a lot going on in this trailer, so let's break it down.\nThe demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind.

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.\nYou can also check out a new trailer for the game below.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.",

Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nXDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.\nFor more on XDefiant, check out our preview, or if you want to see some gameplay, our episode of New Gameplay Today.",

The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.\n\n\nThe game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. \nWe also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.\n\n\nThe update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.\nVampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. For more on the game, check out why we gave it such a high review, or learn about its upcoming TV adaptation.",

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC.

The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.\nThe new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

The footage was impressive in both visuals and performance.\nUnfortunately, no specific release date was offered, but it was given a 2024 release window.",

The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.\n\n\nThe description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.\n\"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi,\" the description says. \"Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix.

The trailer (but not the full game, presumably) stars Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd fame as Dave commiserating about the age of heroes being over and the age of agriculture being the future. In a twist, however, it is revealed that Ayoade's character is a giant fending off heroes who are trying to invade his home.\n\n\nFrom there an action sequence begins with a hero outrunning the giant Ayoade. It is revealed in the end that the hero has defeated the giant by show of them sitting on his shattered glasses. The trailer's description on YouTube shares that this new entry will continue to take place in Albion.\nNo release date was revealed, but the game will be available on Game Pass day one.",

This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.\nAs Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. \n\n\nIn addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).",

Players guide three very different characters – a samurai, a Kodama spirit, and a cat – on a journey to save Japan from invading Oni. As the samurai Takeshi and the much smaller Kodoma, you’ll hack apart undead soldiers and supernatural foes from Japanese mythology. As the cat, platforming and stealth are the names of the game, as you’ll avoid enemies such as one, particularly toothy and terrifying-looking demon. \nThe Spirit of the Samurai has been in the works for a few years by developer Digital Mind Games and arrives in 2024 for PC.",

          "description": "After years wallowing in purgatory, 2011's Shadow of the Damned is getting another shot in the limelight via a remaster. On top of that, developer Grasshopper Manufacture is holding its own E3-style presentation next week.\nShadows of the Damned was the product of a collaboration between Grasshopper's Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), who wrote the game, and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who served as a producer. It's a third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who must rescue his girlfriend after she's abducted by the forces of the underworld with the help of his trusty phallic-joke loving demon, Johnson. The game's bombastic, supernatural action and absurd sense of humor made it generally well-liked upon release (We scored it a 9.25 out of 10 in our review), but it has never been ported beyond its original platforms on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's about to change.\n\n\nThe humorous trailer doesn't reveal any details about the remaster, but we'll likely learn more at the inaugural Grasshopper Direct on June 14. The event celebrates the studios 25th anniversary and kicks off at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET, so fans in the U.S. will have to brew an extra cup of coffee if they want to catch the event live. \nAre you a fan of Shadows of the Damned or does this remaster entice you to give it a shot?

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

However, the game will still be playable for those who own it through at least the following year, meaning up to December 31, 2024. Until then, the base price of the game will be dropped to $4.99, and each piece of DLC will cost $0.99. \npic.twitter.com/n52hJPUxwx\nJune 8, 2023\n\nFriday the 13th: The Game pits a team of players controlling Camp Crystal Lake counselors working together to survive against a player-controlled Jason Voorhees. The game didn’t arrive to the warmest reception when it launched in 2017, but it’s always a bummer to see games disappear, especially when it's at the mercy of IP licensing.

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. PS: we made a mistake in the Windows release; a 13.2.1 was pushed to address this issue. It is fully network compatible with 13.2, so no need to update unless you want to. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
