          "description": "We go hands-on with the Aya Neo 2021 Pro.\nNext year, the Switch will be five years old – a fact which makes the continued demand for the console all the more remarkable. Despite being powered by technology that, even back in 2017, could hardly be described as cutting-edge, the hybrid system has shifted over 90 million units worldwide and shows no signs of slowing down as we move into 2022.\nEven so, Nintendo is savvy enough to know that continual hardware refreshes are a good way of maintaining momentum, and it has already iterated on the base Switch model twice (three times if you count the version with improved battery life). This year's OLED model is perhaps the most significant enhancement, bringing with it a larger, super-bright display, improved audio and superior build quality. However, the one thing that many people were hoping for is absent: more power under the hood. In terms of processing prowess, it's essentially the same deal as the 2017 original.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Interestingly, those releases alone have included two titles that can certainly be described as 'divisive' — we're thinking Skyward Sword's arm-waving controls (though the HD release has button options), and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link being that one that hardly anyone's beaten. Heck, there are people that say Breath of the Wild is overrated, even if this writer and a fair few others would happily die on a hill arguing in favour of its brilliance.\nZelda is a series that, partly because of the passion and love it fosters, also draws out strong opinions whatever route it follows. Some said Wind Waker was too cartoony, others said Twilight Princess wasn't bright enough. Some games are too traditional, or not traditional enough, or they're whatever Tri Force Heroes was (which could have been great with a few different design choices, arguably).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dhampir squib.\nThese days, it feels like every other ‘new’ game being released is a remake or a remaster of some old game. There’s value in this, however, as it’s wonderful to have great games that were previously locked to old platforms brought onto modern devices with improvements and additions. But, just because a game is retro, doesn’t mean it needs to be revisited. Some games are best left in the past, and BloodRayne is one of them. While it may have a mildly interesting premise in 2002, BloodRayne ReVamped is a boring, shoddy, and nearly-broken mess of a game that you should definitely avoid.\nBloodRayne places you in the role of Rayne, a half-human half-vampire ‘dhampir’ living in the '30s during the height of the Nazi regime. Hitler has formed a secret organization to investigate how the occult can be utilized to aid the Nazi effort, and this has resulted in Rayne being called in to deal with the problems which that obviously has started to cause. It’s far from a gripping narrative, and it’s not helped at all by the dull, bored performances from the voice cast, but there’s something vaguely alluring to be found in what a schlocky mess the story turns out to be. It’s in that ‘so-bad-it’s-good’ category.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It’s been a little over 9 months since Fights In Tight Spaces first released on to Steam Early Access, and as of December 2nd, it’s kicked open the door and walked into a full release. It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. \r\n\n\r\n  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game's multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The teams over at Motion Twin and Evil Empire have got your back. The latest DLC, The Queen And The Sea, has been teased with a tiny new trailer.\nThe Queen And The Sea is currently planned for a release early next year. It's described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.\nRead more",

They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.\r\n\n\r\nThat's pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. \r\n\n\r\nThe patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.\r\n \nRead more",

What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black.

The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.\nIn that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she's written a message on the palm of her hand reading \"He is alive\". I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.\nRead more",

All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\nUnless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters.

          "description": "Well, chums, Black Friday itself has been and gone. I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I did manage to procure a solid bottom-rest at a good discount and I’m very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, it still cost a good chunk of change, leaving me with much less to spend on my recently rediscovered Warhammer habit.\r\n\nLuckily for anyone still looking for somewhere to park their behind while gaming, you can get your hands (cheeks?) on a Razer Iskur gaming chair worth £500 for free.

          "description": "As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there's one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn't win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn't rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I've ever played. \nRead more",

The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. \r\n\n\r\nSadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.\r\n \nRead more",

But before then, Epic are currently giving away a whole other manner of slaughter, the hunting sim TheHunter: Call Of The Wild.

Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.\nAs it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.\nRead more",

I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.\nYeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.\nRead more",

If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I'd much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they'd follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move. But I don't think we need to see more of Shepard's side of things, you know? They should put Liara front-and-centre instead.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. \nBloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think this Spartacus service sounds like a true competitor to Xbox Game Pass?

Players control an astronaut who returns to Earth after a mission only to find the planet upended by an alien invasion.\nAfter a botched reentry to Earth, protagonist Charlie Gray finds herself alone, emotionally broken, but driven by a singular mission to locate her missing daughter. She’s up against an intimidating extraterrestrial menace, specifically an invisible hunter tracking her every move. Charlie must outwit this foe to survive while also confronting more in-your-face threats such as shambling corpse-like creatures in over-the-shoulder third-person combat. Charlie may not be a soldier, but she is a brilliant engineer, using those skills to concoct blueprints for tools by examining everyday objects. Think of her like a McGyver. As a survival game, managing Charlie’s nutrition, hydration, and mental health are vital.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAftermath’s foreboding presentation and atmosphere come courtesy of artist Alessandro Bavari, art designer for Alien: Covenant.

Oddly enough, despite Amalur being available on the Switch, THQ Nordic’s press release about today’s Fatesworn news doesn’t mention the Switch when it comes to platforms for the expansion. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“This year on December 14, the journey of the Fateless One continues,” THQ Nordic’s press release reads. “After the Crystal War has been fought and Gadlow has been defeated, the people of Amalur were hoping for peace to return to their lands. And although peace has indeed come to Amalur, rumors of a new threat are starting to spread, rising in the far west, the icy lands of Mithros. None other than Telogrus, the God of Chaos himself has awoken and is gathering followers to throw the whole world into chaos.” \nTHQ Nordic says Fatesworn adds a whole new storyline to Amalur, a new environment to explore, multiple new quests and missions, new Chaos Realm dungeons, extra gameplay mechanics, more weapons and armor, never-before-seen enemies, and more. It will also raise the level cap of Amalur to 50 and it features a new soundtrack by composer Grant Kirkhope.\nYou must own the base Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning in order to purchase and play Fatesworn, which will be out on December 14. Perhaps more interesting than the content of Fatesworn is the fact that it’s an expansion for a game that came out 10 years ago. That’s quite unheard of in games, especially single-player ones.

          "description": "Since the reveal of The Foundation, a character critical to Fortnite Chapter 2’s ongoing overarching narrative, fans have speculated on who it might be. The number one theory links The Foundation to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and for good reason – the character’s armor features a design that matches up nicely with Johnson’s tattoos. \nWe were all but confident that Johnson was The Foundation, but the actor’s new Twitter video today seems to finally confirm the role. Oddly enough, it comes by way of a ZOA energy drink ad in which Johnson is seen talking about ZOA while using words that match up with Fortnite – zero point, higher ground, foundation, and the universe, to name a few. \nLate night grind, POWERED BY @zoaenergy💥⚡️\n#ifyouknowyouknow 🦾 pic.twitter.com/admN7U9QKt\nDecember 2, 2021\nThen, as you can see above, he reaches into a fridge to grab a ZOA, and lo and behold, The Foundation’s helmet is sitting there. Of course, Johnson ignores it – cheeky – but then he returns right to using some Fortnite-centric words again. The tweet that accompanies his video also says “#ifyouknowyouknow” with a robotic arm beside it, so...uhh yeah, Johnson is The Foundation – we smell what you’re cooking. \nThe timing of this reveal is curious, too – Fortnite Chapter 3 is right around the corner. Perhaps The Foundation is primed to take on a more significant role in the battle royale’s story. Maybe we’ll hear Johnson’s voice as The Foundation in Chapter 3. Only time will tell for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out this trailer that shows Fortnite Chapter 2 is coming to an end before Chapter 3 launches sometime soon. Check out Game Informer’s Fornite review after that, and then give Game Informer’s list of all Marvel and DC characters in Fortnite a look. \nAre you excited to see what The Rock is cooking?

Ultimate roster was finally complete, and now, the game’s balance tuning is also complete after a new update that’s now live. \nFirst reported by Kotaku, Nintendo revealed on Twitter that the latest Ultimate balance update, Ver. 13.0.1 has been distributed and will be “the last update related to the balance adjustments of the game.” However, Nintendo said that other updates might happen to fix problems related to Ultimate. Director Masahiro Sakura also used this update to give thanks to everyone involved. \nバランス調整もこれで完了です。調整関係者各位、おつかれさまでした。\nhttps://t.co/10X7YREOnJ\nDecember 2, 2021\n“Balance adjustment is now complete,” Sakurai writes on Twitter. “Thank you to everyone involved in the coordination. The fighters used in the top-ranked battles and the average online win rate are all different, so I think this is a generally desirable distribution.” \nThe actual update features nearly 60 changes to character moves, spanning 24 different fighters. There are damage increases, speed boosts, animation length changes, and much more. You can check out the full update patch notes here. As noted by Kotaku, there are quite a handful of buffs – more buffs than nerfs, even – so many of your favorite fighters are probably feeling a touch stronger than usual. \nFor more about Ultimate, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review and then read about how Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global for new Ultimate and Melee tournaments.

          "description": "Halo Infinite’s full release is just around the corner, and several players have already taken a liking to its free-to-play multiplayer mode. One player, in particular, named “Sakana,” posted a ridiculous clip (seen below) to Twitter, showcasing the stopping power of one of the franchise’s most popular rifles. With one sniper bullet, 23 players are eliminated in mere seconds. \n23人抜きスナイパー　#HaloInfinite pic.twitter.com/AjCoGewbL1\nNovember 30, 2021\nImpressive, right? Sure, Sakana got a bunch of buddies to stand single-file, but the results are still cool as hell. Watching the kill-points increase and the red-hued damage indicator flash per each downed Spartan is pretty satisfying. The only highlight that could top this would be if 23 players somehow lined up inadvertently in the middle of a standard multiplayer match. Let’s see how many people load into big team battles in the hopes of achieving this legendary feat. Trust me, you’re more likely to get a 23-player killing spree by playing the game mode normally. \nThis isn’t the only wild thing that people have done in Halo Infinite. We’ve seen players grapple the vehicle bumpers as if wakeboarding … but without the board. We’ve learned that Spartans can lob fusion coils with NFL-level arm strength. The list goes on and on and will likely extend to Infinite’s single-player mode when it releases on December 8 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. \nIf you’re a Halo fanatic like we are, be sure to enter the Swarovski sweepstakes for this crystallized Master Chief helmet and energy sword. And if you’re not an Xbox Games Pass member, then you’re missing out as Ultimate subscribers are slated to get access to monthly multiplayer bonuses.  Those’ll go nicely with the extra six-match XP that 343 Industries implemented in its latest Halo update. \nThat 23-player killing spree was nuts, right?

My small team of survivors committed a little under forty hours building fortifications around the crash zone, scouring for food and rare weapons in sprawling underground caverns, and keeping cannibals and, later, grotesque mutants at bay. The sequel, Sons of the Forest, got two trailers earlier this year, highlighting a newfound emphasis on storytelling. An unnamed NPC – specifically, a nonvolatile mutant – is slated to be the player’s companion. But beyond montages and short action sequences, previous Sons of the Forest footage inspired more questions than answers. \nA new trailer (seen below) continues that exciting, albeit frustrating, tradition of narrative vagueness.

          "description": "Next year, a new story-driven DLC is coming to first-person cyberpunk action-platformer, Ghostrunner, and it’s called Project_Hel. \nIGN revealed the news yesterday after developer 505 Games teased the “Ultimate DLC” last week. It turns out that “Ultimate DLC” was Project_Hel, the upcoming story-driven DLC where players will control Hel, one of the bosses from the game. Project_Hel will go live in January, but before that, some players will have the chance to go hands-on with it during a private beta held sometime before the DLC’s launch. \nHel will be a “combat-oriented character designed to appeal to ‘new players and veterans,’ and will feature her own ability progression system,” according to IGN. The story of Project_Hel will take place over six new missions that task Hel with descending from Dharma Tower, a locale heavily featured in the base game. Alongside new missions, Project_Hel will include new enemies, new bosses, and six new songs from Daniel Deluxe. \n505 Games told IGN that it was initially planned as a smaller DLC before becoming a “full-blown Ghostrunner experience.” It will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Amazon Luna on January 27. It will cost $14.99.\nThe studio also revealed that a new Holiday Pack would hit the game on December 7, and it’s a free cosmetics pack that includes holiday swords with matching gloves and more. \nWhile waiting for Project_Hel to launch in January, read about how native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Ghostrunner launched back in September. Then, check out this flashy neon pack that launched back in August alongside new assist options and a roguelike wave mode. Read about how 505 Games has already confirmed Ghostrunner 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC after that.  \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about Ghostrunner’s Project_Hel DLC?

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop three times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as a cool camo option for your spartan and vehicles (see above).\nThe biggest bundle is the Anubis Armor Set for the Mark VII Spartan. This set offers the Arctic Void Epic Armor Coating, the Anubis Epic Helmet, a new visor and shoulder pads, and the rather mundane Vigilant Watch stance. It retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.\nThe most visually pleasing option in this week's offering is the Splinter Desert Epic Armor Coating that gives your Spartan a gray camo look. This texture can also be applied to all vehicles. This bundle is 1,500 credits.\nIf you love seeing your Spartan stand in generic poses, you can purchase the Tacticlamp 117 bundle to get another stance of a Spartan holding a pistol in a rather trivial way. The last item offered is the Reach Falcon Pilot Pack, consisting of a Falcon Nameplate and matching vehicle and weapon Emblems, along with new shoulder pads for your Spartan. This pack requires you have the Mark V armor from the Heroes of Reach Battle Pass. You can see all of the items in the image below:",

Instead, you can take a look at Starfield in a very different fashion, with a behind-the-scenes look with game director Todd Howard, studio director Angela Browder, and art director Matt Carofano. It’s more of a micro look at Bethesda’s approach to their games, their stories, and their open worlds. It’s more of a conversational approach than a lot of game trailers, but it looks like it’s simply setting the stage for lots more to come regarding Starfield. Check out the full video right here.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThis is really just Episode One of a Starfield trailer series, so inevitably there will be a lot more on the way before Starfield’s release.

There is, of course, loot and wealth to be found throughout each of these dungeons, and there seems to be a cute bat at the center of its story, as the name alludes to. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Ancient Dangers looks quite great and it’s tough to picture it as a game made inside Dreams, which is itself a game. Credit to Media Molecule, though, for doing just that. Ancient Dangers looks great, too, which is especially exciting because it’s already out as of today. \nHere’s the official description for Ancient Dangers:\nAncient Dangers is a third-person dungeon crawler, featuring a single-player mode where players control Scoria, and a co-op mode, which adds Scoria’s twin, Gabbro, to the mix. The co-op mode is couch co-op only, though. Media Molecule says new PlayStation trophies have been added to Dreams for players to unlock while playing through Ancient Dangers, too, so if trophy hunting is your thing, you don’t want to miss this. \nFor more about Dreams, check out our thoughts on its release in Game Informer’s Dreams review. \nWill you be checking out Ancient Dangers: A Bat’s Tale?

After weeks of throwing around the oddball and hacking up competitors with the sizzling sword, is it time to take the campaign trek? Well, here’s the first big trailer from the campaign, unveiled today.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFPS campaigns often range from the mundane to the majestic and we don’t know just where Halo Infinite’s falls just yet. Clearly, much has changed since the underwhelming demo slice of legend that gave rise to big-time internet memes and a fair amount of concern about what the final game would play like. That said, we’ll be looking closely to see what the verdict is as we get closer to launch. While multiplayer hasn’t been without issues, especially ones related to battle pass progression, game customization, and more, overall Halo Infinite’s “return to form” for Halo seems to be well received thus far. Take a look at how the campaign has changed from its initial reveal to now in the video below!\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThere’s not a whole lot you can extrapolate from a trailer like this except “get hype”, and with a game like Halo, you’re already probably either onboard for what this new campaign experience is poised to serve up or unlikely to be swayed by what’s on deck here.

Techland's press release also had some words from Tymon Smektała, lead game designer on Dying Light 2. In it, he speaks about how the work on the game isn't quite done yet, saying, \"The fact that the game is done and we hit the gold status two months before the release is a great sign but it doesn’t mean that our work ends here. There are still some upgrades and tweaks to add, and community feedback to implement, but the base is solid and ready to play.\"\nSo, while much of the work is in the rearview mirror, there's plenty to tweak and fix before the public is finally able to play it. Still, the feat of shipping a game is a massive undertaking and one worth celebrating. Tymon says, \"I’m extremely proud of the whole team!\" Considering the ups and downs the project faced over the course of a long development process, he should be. \nThe next time we'll see Dying Light 2 Stay Human is just around the corner. This Thursday, Techland will premiere Episode 5 in its Dying 2 Know series, where about 15 minutes of new gameplay will be shown. You can find that at 12 p.m. Pacific on Techland's Twitch channel.\nDying Light 2 Stay Human is well on track to hit its February 4, 2022 date to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch (cloud version), and PC. For more on Dying Light 2, check out Brian Shea's recent preview where he played four hours of the game.",

          "description": "For many of us at Game Informer, Halo Infinite's free-to-play multiplayer is a blast that feels nostalgic and refreshingly new at the same time. However, a point of contention (one that's also been shared by the wider Halo community) is the monotonous grind of accumulating XP points. Infinite's progression system leaves a lot to be desired, and leveling tends to be a painful slog. Initially, 343 Industries implemented an update to give players longer durations for XP boosts (among other features). Today's new update goes a step further and increases XP payouts for the first six matches of each day. \nAfter seeing how XP was earned with those changes, we noticed that players were starting their sessions with slower payouts than we'd like. To address this, we will be increasing the XP payout …",

          "description": "Antstream Arcade is now available on the Epic Games Store, boasting over 1000 games to stream to your PC. We learned of its inclusion in the launcher through a story from the folks over at PC Gamer.\nThe streaming service has all kinds of games from the arcade, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, SNES, and many more. While the Antstream is free to download and access, gems or a subscription will be needed to play anything. Epic is offering a welcome pack available for free until Thursday for new players to check out the service, which provides 1090 gems to mess around with. Most games cost 30 gems per play, though, for the price of $39.99 a year, you can play any solo or co-op game without having to pay extra.\nAntsteam features additional benefits to those playing on its platform, including achievements and challenges. Tournaments are also available, pitting your high scores and feats against others in games like Mortal Kombat, Dig Dug, Chain Reaction, or Marble Madness. Winning or scoring highly in these contests will payout in gems to spend on other games or enter future tournaments.\nThere looks to be plenty to check out with Antstream Arcade, with many cool old arcade and console games to try. I'm eyeing some of the SNK and Commodore 64 collections, myself. Keep in mind that you aren't downloading any of these games, so making sure you have a strong network connection will be critical for an optimal experience. Along with the addition to the Epic Games Store, Antstream Arcade is available on PC, iOS, and Android devices.",
