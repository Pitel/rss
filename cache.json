Fire Emblem Engage launched in January and brought the series back to its combat-focused roots, forgoing the relationship-sim elements that had worked so well in its predecessor, Three Houses, for a game where the action came thick and fast.\nWe loved it. Engage provided a sleek and visually stunning take on the franchise's combat mechanics offering up some sweet turn-based tactical action. And this has continued over the ensuing months, with developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo putting out a whopping four separate waves of DLC, culminating in April's 'Fell Xenologue' story add-on.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A completely hypothetical situation to explore how small changes could impact the course of world events. Video games that explore these kinds of questions usually fall into the grand strategy genre, putting players at the head of a faction with the aim to dominate their enemies either through political manipulation or brute force, and seeing what might have happened if some grand historical engagement had gone the other way.\nOne developer that has always been at the heart of the grand strategy genre is Kou Shibusawa, a division of Koei Tecmo that has been producing some of the best and most celebrated historical strategy titles out there, dating back to the original NES.

It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.\nDark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?\nRead more",

It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. \nOne excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters. \nRead more",

Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.\nThe tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.\nRead more",

What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.\nRead more",

But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.\nRead more",

I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.\nRead more",

The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. \nIt's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.\nWhat I'm saying is: it's still worth it.\nRead more",

Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.\nThat's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.\nRead more",

Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?\nHaving seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.\nRead more",

As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games.

Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? \nAnyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.\nRead more",

We've covered more mid-range models before, but today we have something a bit different: a truly mainstream graphics card that delivers excellent 1080p performance at less than £200, plus nice extras like ray-tracing hardware, FSR 2 image upscaling and a modern media encoder for streaming and recording gameplay. \nI'm talking about the AMD Radeon RX 6600, which is available in the popular Sapphire Pulse configuration for £180 plus £8 shipping over at Overclockers UK - with a free copy of the Resident Evil 4 remake. This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago.

So, having seen roughly 30 minutes of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, I can give you the unfettered lowdown of a person who's analysed it with a cold, hard stare. In brief, the game looks rather lovely! If… too lovely. I worry there's a big catch somewhere and I can't put my finger on it.\nRead more",

If only there was a way to get my brain to remember which obstacles were where... Happily, Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown has an ingenious solution. Aside from shaping up to be one of the best platformers I've played in ages, it also has a very neat feature that lets you pin screenshots to your map screen, meaning you'll never have to pointlessly backtrack ever again. \nRead more",

          "description": "After its big reveal at Summer Game Fest on Thursday, the internet has not taken kindly to Ubisoft's new Prince Of Persia game. There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a \"true\" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake. \nRead more",

Having spent a few hours with third-person co-op shooter Remnant 2, I reckon it's shaping up to be exactly those two things. It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care. From what I've played, it's more about being the looter shooter for those who care about fine-tuning the consistency of the numbers they're able to extract from their foes.\nRead more",

          "description": "Vývojář Red Hatu Richard Jones narazil na chybu, která celkem brzy po startu zasekne jádro 6.4, ale jen v jednom z asi 1000 případů. S procesorem Intel se to stává méně často, než s procesorem AMD.  Aby našel zdroj chyby, bylo potřeba dělat bisekci jader 6.0–6.4 a každé jádro bylo nutno pustit 1000×, aby se vyloučila chyba. Pokud se jádro zaseklo dříve, mohlo se pokračovat půlení intervalu dříve.",

As the co-creator of the original Doom and Doom 2, Romero is something of a celebrity in the video game world. Helping to establish the early days of the FPS genre through a young id Software, the designer and programmer is as notable for his contribution to development as he is for his legendary long hair.\nhttps://youtu.be/gIl_TqFJNO8\nSeeing Romero play the \"MyHouse\" WAD file is an interesting spectacle, especially once he gets into the meat of the level. Without spoiling too much, MyHouse.WAD, created by Steve \"Veddge\" Nelson, is a rather unique take on classic Doom. Beginning as an innocent enough-looking mod that features the original game's iconic monsters, things soon take a bizarre turn.\nThroughout the playthrough, which lasts just over an hour, Romero makes a few comments about the map, saying the word \"cool\" a helluva lot. It takes him a while to get going as he searches the titular house to make sure he's seen everything. Once it all kicks off, he seems very impressed with what Veddge has put together. Romero particularly likes the way the music alters as he progresses through the level.\nWhile you could argue that he hasn't made as much of an impact since the early days of Doom and Quake, John Romero is still making games. In fact, he's still tinkering with Doom, having released the SIGIL episode in 2019 as well as working on SIGIL 2.\nYou can download MyHouse.WAD from Doom World if you want to try it for yourself (which we recommend you do). Note: you will need GZDoom in order to run it.\nThe post Doom’s own John Romero plays the infamous ‘MyHouse’ map appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "What accomplishment doesn't he want to achieve?\nBeing one of the most recognizable faces in all of game development, Hideo Kojima is known for his outlandish ideas. While he rose to fame with the Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid franchises, his legacy continued with 2019's Death Stranding, a game synonymous with surrealism.\nNow, the man himself has shown an interest in literally reaching for the stars. In a recent YouTube video, Hideo Kojima was asked by Geoff Keighley about achievements he still has in mind as he approaches 60. Speaking through an interpreter, the director said that he wants to go into outer space. The comment inspires some laughter from the audience. Kojima then goes on to say that he wants to make a game in space that the player can play while also floating about in the cosmos.\nTo hear the quote, skip ahead to around 23:19.\nhttps://youtu.be/fAAbAAqHEic?t=1299\nAnybody who knows the man and his work can say for certain that this is probably not a surprising dream. If you're a fan of his games, you may describe him as a \"visionary.\" He's not always appreciated, but he definitely leaves an impact. Of course, seeing as Hideo Kojima likes to tease, it's entirely possible that this comment about going into space is a bit of a joke on his part.\nStill, it's interesting to imagine what a game in space would be like, and if anyone's going to do it, it may as well be Kojima. However, we seem to be some way off before we regular folk can take trips to the stars. A video game that's been developed and is playable off-planet sounds kooky in a way that a lot of Kojima's ideas sound kooky. But, at the risk of bursting any bubbles, the prospect of such a game would probably be only suitable for the ultrarich. So Bezos could play it, but not you and I.\nBesides, Kojima still needs to finish Death Stranding 2, not to mention that Xbox game he's said to be working on.\nThe post Hideo Kojima wants to develop a game you can literally play in space appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thanks to the introduction of Udon, VRChat's in-house coding language, players are now able to build more complex worlds.

While the action is fairly typical of the era, the storyline is one for the ages. Essentially, World Peace has been achieved on Earth, but the planet has been ravaged by an en masse disappearance of women. As it turns out, a dying intergalactic populace known as the Zancs cannot interbreed, and is instead abducting Earth's women in order to help it repopulate its own race. Big ol' yikes on that one, Taito.\nAnd there's no sign of Roddy Piper anywhere.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlaXGd-SUbY&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays\nAnd thus, fighter pilots Dawnson and Bogey are dispatched to confront the Zancs, speed up the extinction process, and bring back the planet's ladies, one of whom is Dawnson's own gal pal. What follows is standard horizontally-scrolling shmup action, depicted in Taito's typically oversized and kinda vulgar fashion. Power-ups can be gathered in order to boost the players' weaponry. Not explained is how our heroes plan to bring all of the women back to Earth in their two tiny, one-man vessels. But if ask too many questions, then the minute of this carefully crafted narrative begins to come undone. So don't.\nMegablast is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.\nThe post Rescue Earth’s women in Arcade Archives’ oddly-plotted Megablast appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "And it does indeed look absurd\nBack in 2020, Dan Houser left Rockstar following a long hiatus. Being the driving force behind the stories of Grand Theft Auto 5, both Red Dead Redemption games and Max Payne 3 means his absence could lead to some changes for future titles from the GTA developer. That said, seeing as the company has yet to release a new game since his departure, we can't really know for sure.\nHowever, Houser is back with his new company, Absurd Ventures. According to a report from Polygon, this outfit will give the writer and producer a new outlet for some upcoming projects. In a press release, Houser said that he and his team are \"building Absurd Ventures to create new universes and to tell great stories, wherever and however we can.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/n5-9SeQjAEc\nJust what the studio actually has in mind will be the topic of much discussion going forward, no doubt. You can have a look at the Absurd Ventures website for some faint clues, though there's very little there to say about what's in the pipeline. There's also a video promoting the company, but it's a series of bizarre imagery that really leaves more questions than answers. We'll just have to wait to see what the studio conjures up, but given the name that's attached, it's going to be of interest to a lot of people.\nAlong with his brother Sam, Dan Houser is responsible for one of the biggest franchises in gaming history via the Rockstar brand. Grand Theft Auto began life in 1997, with Dan being credited as either writer, co-writer, or producer on pretty much every entry since the London 1969 expansion from way back in the day.\nTo many fans, it will be a little strange not seeing his name in the credits for GTA 6, when that actually comes out. However, there's no doubt that what he has planned for Absurd Ventures will turn heads, especially with the words \"is it OK to dream again?\" seen in the promo video.\nThe post Dan Houser, co-founder of Rockstar, unveils Absurd Ventures media outfit appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie was a smash hit, leading it to become the second highest-grossing animated movie ever. After such success, making a The Legend of Zelda movie would seem like a logical next step.\nA recent report claimed that Illumination, the studio behind the Mario movie, is already working with Nintendo to make an adaptation of the Zelda series. The rumor spread like Internet wildfire, but there's one problem with this story. TheWrap talked with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri to ask about a Zelda movie, and it looks like Link's story isn't on the table for the studio. Meledandri even adds that he has no idea where these rumors are coming from. Outside of blind guesses from fans, that is.\n\"I mean I can understand how people would surmise all sorts of things because obviously, we’ve had a great experience working together,\" said Meledandri. \"My relationship with Nintendo now includes being on their board of directors, so I understand how people can surmise these things. But in terms of the specifics, that was just something that I’ve been hearing lots of reports. This is just about what’s next between Nintendo and Illumination.”\n\nRumors every week\nBenjamin Renner, a director at Illumination currently working on Migration, also chimed in about the issue. He says that he sees \"one report every week\" of what their team is working on next, and this one just so happened to be Zelda.\nIllumination, the studio behind other hits such as Sing and Despicable Me, has already fast-tracked a Mario sequel. That could prove to be a reason why a Zelda movie might not see the light of day just yet.\nStill, the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie has earned Meledandri a seat on Nintendo's board of directors. We'll have to wait and see if Illumination will take on other Nintendo properties in the future.\nThe post Illumination CEO denies report of Zelda movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.\nJust to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.\nJune 18, 2023\nHere, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be \"deeply involved\" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will \"introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe,\" according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.\nIn addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:\nGiven the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.",

Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. \nEmbark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. \n\n\nA prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. \nFire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week.

Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. \n\n\nWe awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, \"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction.

          "description": "Dead Cells joins the growing list of video games getting animated series adaptations with a show based on the popular action roguelike slated to arrive next year.\nThis series comes from French animation studio Bobbypills, which is also animating Netflix’s upcoming Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired Captain Laserhawk. Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. \n\n\nDead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. \nFor more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.",

Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.\nThe collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.\n\n\nThe Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.\nApollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia.

The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nXDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions.

The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.\n\n\nThe game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. \nWe also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The game graces Game Informer’s cover this month, and you can read a month’s worth of exclusive features about the game by visiting our coverage hub.",

Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.\n\n\nThe update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.\nVampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices.

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC.

          "description": "Today’s Xbox Showcase gave us a first meaningful look at Avowed, the upcoming fantasy RPG on the way from the team at Obsidian. The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.\nThe new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

The footage was impressive in both visuals and performance.\nUnfortunately, no specific release date was offered, but it was given a 2024 release window.",

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
