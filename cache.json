          "description": "Coming to Switch very soon.\nZelda's great. On that, we can all agree. Fighting monsters! Exploring dungeons! Battling gigantic bosses! ...But Zelda games don't usually give Link much freedom when it comes to settling down. Although Breath of the Wild gave you a house for the first time — previously you were always living with family, or squatting in a treehouse — there wasn't much you could do with it. Gardening? Fat chance. Furniture? Lol no. And befriending the villagers? Good luck with that, mate.\nBut Lonesome Village may just offer the Zelda-Animal Crossing fusion that you've always dreamed of. Although there's no combat, you'll be doing a lot of exploration, finding mysterious ruins, solving puzzles, and uncovering long-lost secrets. When you're not out adventuring, you'll return home to the titular village and make yourself a life, befriending your neighbours, customising your house, and, of course, working in your garden.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A golden opportunity for Link.\nLynels are often considered one of Link's most fearsome foes in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With their huge, hulking figure, alarming speed, and dangerous weapons, we've had many a run-in with these creatures that have often ended in disaster. But someone's figured out a wait to clip this beast's fur and completely disarm it, turning this foe into nothing more than a big puppy.\nOver on Twitter, @zelda_watchan (found via Automaton Media) has shared a clip of them taunting a Lynel who is standing there, motionless, unable to do anything. Automaton Media has translated the tweet as \"I was able to take a Lynel’s weapons away and leave it completely helpless. In this state, it won’t attack no matter what you do.\" And that's exactly what happened, as this video on Twitter demonstrates (warning, the video contains a pretty rude, if artistically-drawn, hand gesture).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Combine this with our love of physical media and you would think that news of an OlliOlli World physical release would be enough to make our heart do a kickflip; except, the game's 'physical' release is not all that it seems.\nToday, Private Division and Roll7 announced that a physical version of the game will be released on October 28th, 2022.

          "description": "In need of a re-remaster.\nWhen a studio looks to remaster an older title from its repertoire, the absolute minimum expectation is that the new version looks and perhaps plays better than the original, making the most of modern hardware and, where appropriate, integrating new features to align with modern gameplay sensibilities. Granted, the results have often been quite fluctuating; on one side, you’ve got astounding works of art like the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, which arguably improves on the original games in every conceivable way, but on the other there are examples like Silent Hill HD Collection that undoubtedly serve as reminders of why some games should just be left well alone.\nLife is Strange: Arcadia Bay Collection sits somewhere in the middle. It showcases two strong entries from the burgeoning franchise — Life is Strange and Life is Strange: Before the Storm — in their entirety, but its release on Switch does little more than highlight both games’ shortcomings, primarily in terms of presentation and visuals. It’s a collection that’s honestly difficult to recommend if you’ve already experienced Don’t Nod’s creation. If you’re completely new to the franchise, then this is an adequate way to experience two solid narrative-driven games.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I've experienced in a game.\nGuiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King's Row and Route 66, it's like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I'm not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.\n Read more",

As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base.

Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.\nRead more",

          "description": "Out Of Hands is a fairly \"does what it says on the tin\" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill \"a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that\" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?\nBut in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative.

          "description": "At this year's Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio's Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.\nI like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. \nFor Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. \"He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,\" creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. \"He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.\nThis looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.\nAs well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.\n Read more",

          "description": "I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon. \nRead more",

Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.\r\n\n\r\nStill. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner.

Ken will step into his new guise as the Soaring Falcon Ranger, while Cammy becomes the Stinging Crane Range, complete with a brand new projectile attack!\n\n \nAs with Ryu and Chunners' Power Rangers pseudonyms, the new designs for Ken and Cammy reflect the colors and costumes of their Street Fighter iterations, freshly tweaked to fit within the bodysuited battleverse of the long-running Saban franchise. Ken appears to be sleeveless in his ranger gear, which must be borderline heresy to the Power Rangers community. Cammy is instantly recognizable, and even has a red metal beret sculpted directly into her battle helmet.\n\nKen and Cammy stand around six inches in height and feature full articulation, allowing them to be posed in all manner of dynamic stances. In addition, the figures come with various effect elements, so they can be displayed performing their unique, special attacks. The figures are expected to retail for around $35 USD, and will launch in March 2023. The Ryu and Chun-Li Power Rangers variants are available to pre-order right now, and are expected to launch a month earlier in February 2023.\nStreet Fighter's Ken and Cammy receive Power Rangers crossover action figures [Eventhubs]\nThe post Ken and Cammy join the Street Fighter x Power Rangers figure range appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.\nOverwatch became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases.

Halt\nPublisher Sega and developer Relic Entertainment have announced that the incoming strategy sequel Company of Heroes 3 has been hit with a delay and will no longer meet its November release date — It is now rescheduled to launch on PC on February 23, 2023.\nSpeaking in a statement on Twitter, the development team said that it believes the military sequel is not quite up to the standards expected of the team or the player community, and will be using the additional four months for additional development time, stamping out bugs, tweaking balance, and further polishing visual elements of the final product. Company of Heroes 3 had previously taken steps to revitalize its build following feedback from a beta period, which took place in November of last year.\nhttps://twitter.com/CompanyOfHeroes/status/1577297241894789124?s=20&t=3DZZoaA22NyOmP1nlLlPxw\nShowing remarkable restraint for video game fans, the Company of Heroes community reacted to news of the day with positive patience, asking Relic to continue with their work in hopes of delivering the greatest entry in the acclaimed series to date. CoH 3 is set against the backdrop of the Italian and African theaters of World War II, and will feature all of the scalpel-precise, point-balancing, tactical action of the previous games, complete with a whole new environmental destruction engine and several new visual effect improvements. Additionally, players will be able to pause the action and queue up multiple maneuvers — allowing plans to be executed in real time when gameplay resumes.\nCompany of Heroes 3 will launch February 23, 2023 on PC.

Then listen to it again. And again.\nIn case you're wondering: it's from Final Fantasy Record Keeper, which came out roughly eight years ago. Sadly, the game is no longer active, as service ended globally on September 29. But that hasn't stopped folks from sharing their memories of the game, including some Record Keeper exclusive aesthetics and songs. Record Keeper actually has multiple versions of the Chocobo theme, including this fiddle-related sampling, and more traditional versions.\nKnowing that there's a ska version of the Chocobo theme that now needs to be preserved wholly by fans is really sad: and speaks to the transient nature of mobile-only games. While we haven't exited the era of endless-mobile-games-as-a-service-only-to-be-shutdown-a-few-years-later; they're still prevalent, and many of them have some really cool moments of creativity like this song.\nIdeally, we can preserve a lot of them through various means like clipping parts of it and posting them on social media. While Record Keeper had fundamental issues, stuff like this deserves to be remembered. Hearing different takes on classic tracks almost never gets old.\nhttps://twitter.com/itsybatsy/status/1575985961980563456\nThe post The ska version of the Final Fantasy Chocobo theme slaps appeared first on Destructoid.",

Agent 47's new undertaking is now aiming to launch on January 26, 2023.\nA new blog from IO Interactive details the roadmap ahead for Hitman 3: Freelancer, in a series it's calling Road to Freelancer. The Hitman developer plans for several updates between now and January 26, including a closed technical test.\nOn October 6, a new patch and roadmap will arrive for Hitman 3. Another update on October 27 will have details about when the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will start and how to get access.\nThen, in November, IO plans to host the test. More updates will arrive between then and January 26, when the game mode goes live.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otBhG8ZldvQ\nFreelancer was originally planned for earlier this year, but has faced a few delays along the way. Hitman 3 has still been seeing some content roll out though, with its latest location Ambrose Island dropping in July.\nA new way to play\nThe upcoming Freelancer mode is being billed as a roguelike adaptation of the Hitman formula. In it, Agent 47 will have a safehouse and series of contracts to carry out. Loadouts and mission planning can be set up in advance, and equipment can be acquired or lost in the field.\nThis mode seems like a way to not just test out veteran Hitman players, but to add some interesting wrinkles and challenges to the existing map pool. IO says today that it's pushed beyond its initial scope for Freelancer to include \"almost all locations\" from the World of Assassination trilogy on day one. It's also going to be a free update for Hitman 3 owners.\nSo if you've got Hitman 3 on PC via Steam, you might be able to hop into the Freelancer test. Otherwise, it's headed to Hitman 3 owners on January 26, 2023.\nThe post Hitman 3’s roguelike Freelancer mode moves to January appeared first on Destructoid.",

Full-on total conversions are perhaps the king of these types of projects, but even things like the below Pokemon Yellow 3D remake from YouTube channel Pokebro (spotted by Nintendo Life) are on the list too.\nStarting with the challenge of \"how hard can it be to make a 2D game in 3D in two weeks,\" Pokebro managed to scrap this thing together in time. The first thing they did is import existing models for the main trainer (Red) and Pikachu: with the caveat that the latter's model needed to be spruced up a bit (there was a big hole in its head that was covered by a dome).\nFrom there, they had to program the Pikachu model to follow the trainer around, with an auto-battle system in place. Next comes recreating a select few environments (they reproduced up the first gym battle with Brock), and creating a spherical AI system of sorts that checks to see if there are Pokemon in Pikachu's radius that it can battle.\nThe rest of the Pokemon were created by Pokebro (with proper HP bars), which interface with the main Pikachu model with the automatic battle system. Said system has Pikachu latch onto an enemy (denoted by an exclamation point above its head), battle them with electric and tackle animations, then return to the trainer.\nEven if you don't like the visual style, the process of how Pokebro programmed all of this stuff to work in concert is worth checking out at just a short four and a half minute runtime. If you're interested in taking on a challenge of your own, you can find the trainer and Pikachu models at the aforementioned links.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXBLMqqBlaM&t=227s\nThe post This Pokemon Yellow 3D fan mockup looks like 3D Dot Heroes appeared first on Destructoid.",

Grubb has been proven to be pretty darn accurate in these matters, so it looks like NFS fans should start revving their engines, and keep their eyes peeled for a new trailer in the very foreseeable future.\nWe will, of course, bring you all of the wheel-spinning deets right here on Destructoid.\nThe post EA teases incoming Need for Speed sequel reveal appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "These late stage amiibo are great looking\nThanks to a live showing at the Zurich Pop-Con & Game Show this past weekend, we have a look at the real Sephiroth and Kazuya amiibo models for the first time.\nObtained by way of images from Twitter user OctoBoxie (through a conversation with the great amiibo resource Amiibo News), Sepiroth is sporting his signature \"winged form\" (the term that Smash uses internally), and Kazuya is ready to fight in a battle pose. As you can see from the header image, these look just like the mockups we got months ago from one of the last Super Smash Bros. Ultimate streams. All we have to see now is Pyra/Mythra (which have poses too) and a potential Sora figure.\nThe photos confirm that these detailed figures line up with the great quality of the new Splatoon 3 amiibo. As a reminder, those were shown at the Comic Con/Made in Asia convention in Brussels, Belgium. Nintendo is really bringing out the big amiibo guns to trade shows this year.\nAs always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. The following amiibo are confirmed but not yet released:\nSplatoon 3 wave (Holiday 2022):\nOctoling (Blue)\nInkling (Yellow)\nSmallfry\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):\nSephiroth\nPyra/Mythra\nKazuya\nSora\nPictures of the Sephiroth and Kazuya amiibo:\nhttps://twitter.com/OctoBoxie/status/1577157419272007681\nThe post Here’s our first look at the gorgeous Sephiroth and Kazuya amiibo appeared first on Destructoid.",

And, of course, it wouldn't be the GOTY season without the coming of Geoff Keighley's big-ass extreme bash: The Game Awards.\nThis year, ticket-buying members of the public will be able to purchase entry to the live event. This marks the first time the public is allowed entry to the event, having been understandably being barred from attending since the onset of COVID-19. For the 2022 event, however, we mere peasants will be allowed to rub shoulders with the game industry's great and good, (there are some, honestly), to enjoy a few hours of live performances, trophy handouts, and trailer, after trailer, after trailer — no doubt rounded out with a 20-second video from Hideo Kojima.\nSo, if you fancy heading to Los Angeles for this year's event to see Elden Ring win everything, then keep your eyes glued to both Geoff Keighley's Twitter, and the Microsoft Theater website. Tickets will go on sale on November 1, though the price for entry is yet to be been announced. Be sure to iron your T-shirt with a tuxedo drawn on it, and don't forget to bring your wheelie shoes and invisible dog leash.

I have no info on this.\"\nThat's the kind of mystery I live for, so I got to researching, and eventually found out that a theater company called Solid Star (Heaven Eleven, Yu x You) is putting on a River City Girls play based on the original game. It's set to be performed live from December 7th to 11th, 2022. That's quite the limited run! And the cast is massive, maybe larger than that of the original game. Is that even possible? Bannon tells me that neither he nor River City Girls 2 writer Adam Tierney have anything to do with this production, so like Willie Scott once sang, \"Anything Goes.\"\nI'd love to see Bannon and Adam go to Japan to review this official(?) River City Girls play, but I'm not sure who'll pay to make that happen. Maybe Solid Star will? Even better would be if they shelled out some extra dough to cast my old Road Rules Northern Trail friend Bob Sapp as Abobo. Bob also hit me up just last Friday, for the first time in 25 years, to see how I was doing. Having Bannon and Bob come at me on the same day feels like more than a coincidence.\nSolid Star, if you're reading this, I will personally pay for Bob's airfare and lodging if that's what it takes to see him hit the stage in your show.

Players will now teleport to the shop interior when selecting the shop from the in-game map, while the tip transitions on loading screens have been stripped down to increase load times. Some menu elements will also be rearranged to prevent you over-eager button mashers from accidentally clicking the wrong option.\nIn addition to the above changes, four more demons will be added to the big book of baddies. These are the fiery Aitvaras, the priestess Isis, comical warrior Neko Shotgun, and finally, the iconic cutie-pie, Pixie (Devil Summoner variant).

Amid the sprinkling of gameplay (more so than the trailer) we've gotten so far, the latest set of clips includes gameplay of a series star. New Fire Emblem Engage Marth footage is out thanks to the series' Twitter account, and gives us a better look at the hero in action.\nHere is the full introduction/mini character bio from the inaugural tweet (translated/cleaned up), which also reveals his Japanese voice actor:\n\"Marth (CV: Hikaru Midorikawa) is commonly known as 'The Beginning Heraldry', and is a noble and charismatic hero among heroes. He is the prince of the Altea Kingdom, located in the alien continent of Archanea,\"\n\nWe get to see how guest characters seem to appear in Engage, and Marth is reconfirmed as a sword user in this entry. There will also be some story elements involved with the summoned heroes, including the below conversation with the main character.\nIf Engage pulls this off, and manages to bring in some of the most celebrated characters in this series' lengthy history, it could lead to some explosive moments. Ideally the team actually manages to make these portions sing: and elevates them over a fanservice-like inclusion.\nFire Emblem Engage Marth footage:\nhttps://twitter.com/FireEmblemJP/status/1575757841809408000\nThe post Nintendo shows off Marth in Fire Emblem Engage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It also asks you to choose between Kain or Raziel\nA new Crystal Dynamics-helmed Legacy of Kain survey has popped up, and could inform the future of the franchise based on its results.\nAlthough it was a fairly short run looking back on it, the series tore onto the gaming scene in 1996, exploded in 1999 with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, and then effectively ended unceremoniously in 2003 with Defiance. Since then the powers that be attempted to resurrect the series in multiplayer form, but it also died off in its own way. But with Crystal Dynamics bought and paid for and part of the Embracer Group now, it's likely time to start tapping into nostalgia.\nAs a reminder, here are the five major Legacy of Kain games that the survey centers on:\nBlood Omen: Legacy of Kain (1996)\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999)\nSoul Reaver 2 (2001)\nBlood Omen 2 (2002)\nLegacy of Kain: Defiance (2003)\nQuestion topics for the Legacy of Kain survey include:\nHave you ever seen someone stream a Legacy of Kain game?\nHow would you rate each game you've played in the series?\nWhat are your favorite parts about the series (mechanically and thematically)?\nWho is your favorite protagonist (Kain or Raziel)?\nWhat would your reaction to a new \"vampire game\" be?\nDo you want to see a sequel, remake, reboot, or remaster?\nDo you want a theoretical game to be single or multiplayer (co-op is also an option)?\nBeyond that, one of the most important questions drills down whether or not you'd rather see a remaster/remake of any of the five core games first. For what it's worth, my top pick is probably a Soul Reaver remake. There are so many different directions you can go, but if I had to choose one possible outcome, that would likely yield one of the best-received/commercially successful single titles.\n[Thanks Jeff!]\nThe post New Legacy of Kain survey hints at possible sequel, remake, reboot, or remaster appeared first on Destructoid.",

Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nThe NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on.

This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. \nTune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros.

There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. \nThis image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. \nSuper Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.\nWhile waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is \"unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world\".

According to Hulst, \"further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services\" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. \n\n\nHowever, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. \n\"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,\" he said. \nWhile Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. \nWhile waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that. \n[Source: Reuters]\nWhat is your dream From Software movie or TV series?

The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. \nTrailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.\nhttps://t.co/n9sLvsOLJS pic.twitter.com/b9GEoOZfEf\nOctober 3, 2022\nThis premiere is being dubbed as the \"first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. \nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. \nThose who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.\nYou can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.\n\nAccording to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.\n\"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,\" he said in a press release. \"I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it.\"\nThe collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.",

          "description": "Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. \nMore specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds \"for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,\" according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you \"will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.\" \nIf you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says \"most hardware purchases...made directly from Google\" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. \nThe Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. \nStadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia. \nDid you use Stadia? What do you think of this news? Let us know in the comments below!",

It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.\nKotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. \nHere's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: \nThe last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. \nAre you excited to play Skull and Bones next March?

As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: \n\n\nI'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. \nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. \nIs Wiglett going to be in your party?

We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.\nTo help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1.

We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.\nE3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. \nThe ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. \nJune 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   \nAs previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a \"world class event to serve the global gaming industry.\" The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019.

As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. \nThe publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. \nWhile waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you want out of a new Silent Hill game?

It also has a new premiere date for the movie following its delay in April. \nThe animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.\nJoin us October 6th at 4pm ET for the teaser trailer premiere of Nintendo & Illumination’s upcoming Super Mario Bros. film, releasing April 7, 2023. pic.twitter.com/1jEFnlvCnU\nSeptember 22, 2022\nThe Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won't have an Italian accent.",

          "description": "The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.",

Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

Whether you're talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom.

It doesn't show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it's bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters).
