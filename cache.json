The building work on the site — since given the official title Nintendo Museum — looked to be on course from the outside, but it seems the museum will miss its target completion date by a month or so.\nThe construction notice displayed at the site, as captured below by @hanayohaneNEKO on Twitter (thanks, Kyotogamer), now lists the completion date as 30th April. It's unclear how long this notice update has been up, but it does appear that the museum won't quite be ready for the end of March.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It has been a decade and a half since we first met Giratina and co. A decade and a half since we stepped foot in the Distortion World. And, most importantly perhaps, a decade and a half since we last got an 'ultimate' third entry to a Pokémon generation.\nWe'll dowse ourselves in Repel Spray before taking a step further — yes, you could count Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon as a 'definitive' edition for Gen VII. In fact, we might even do the same. This is a pair of games that carried much of the same DNA as the ones that came before them (Sun and Moon, in this case) while adding new Pokémon, locations, and a fresh storyline.

Struggling through the political and religious machinations of the lords and ladies around him, he seeks to avenge the death of his family and find a place in the world. But first, he needs to learn how to use a sword…\nOne of the very first tasks in Warhorse Studios' epic RPG is to collect a debt from a lowly drunkard. After a short intro to dialogue choices, you proceed to confidently throw hands with the peasant. After being roundly beaten within an inch of your life, you limp off to mother to get fixed up. It’s an appropriate intro to this gritty journey of bloody revenge. There are many ways to approach a confrontation, it’s going to be a while before violence is the easy option.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, there was Princess Toadstool's Castle Run on Nelsonic Game Watch back in 1990, Princess Peach's very first leading role (which you probably don't need to rush out and buy), and Super Princess Peach on DS, but nothing that feels like a proper turn as the core of a full-on adventure. Until now, that is.\nYep, whilst we were fully expecting this to be a throwaway sort of experience given the above track record, it turns out Princess Peach: Showtime! is easily Ms. Toadstool's finest hour (shocker), and a far more engaging romp than we had prepared for. It's still 100% a game aimed squarely at children, mind, and there's really not a whole ton of challenge for those seeking it, but for younger gamers, for relatives or friends sitting down to have a good old Nintendo sesh with some smaller kids, there's a whole lot of fun to be had with this one.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Solo developer Friedemann took to Xwitter on Monday to detail all the games that inspired him to make Summerhouse in the first place, and there are some really surprising, but fascinating call outs in there, including Stronghold Crusader and Sword & Sworcery. I love it when developers go in-depth about things they've seen in other games and tried to riff on in their own creations, so please, let's make this a tradition for all new game releases, yeah? \nRead more",

Recent events have conspired so that I have experienced a bunch of Warhammer 40K in a way that exposes me to the world passively, without lore dumping. I played the PowerWash Sim x 40K crossover DLC and loved it for just putting cool big machines in front of me and refusing to explain further, so when James picked Darktide as this month's RPS Game Club Game, like someone incautiously opening the door to Mormons, I was ready to let more of the God Emperor into my life. Except, having played some Darktide, I do not want to play Darktide. For me, playing Darktide does, in some measure, get in the way of enjoying Darktide.\nRead more",

          "description": "Being at once repellent and compelling is some kind of criterion for Real Art Status, and Horses - developed by Saturnalia developers Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - certainly earns that accolade. Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it's also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year's Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn't really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.\nPassing By - A Tailwind Journey isn't aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It's the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you're meant to go when they get around to it. It's not a purely vibe-based game, but you'll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.\nRead more",

          "description": "In November last year, the Australian post-apocalyptic CRPG Broken Roads was abruptly delayed mere days before it was meant to come out. Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed \"additional polish time and QA manpower\" to test the \"thousands of permutations\" available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.  \nRead more",

So far we’ve seen the past, the present and the problems surrounding this new buzzword as it filters its way into our games and communities. In this final part of the series, I want to try and think concretely with you about what the future might hold; to go beyond what we think is just or legal, what we might be excited by or fearful of, and instead think about the practicalities of making and playing games today and how that might be impacted by generative AI's growing dominance.\nRead more",

          "description": "Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I've been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It's not that it's difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold's assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than 'feed the fish' and 'talk to so and so', all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.\nRather, it's Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He's a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he's some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn't help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone's underlying frustration with him like it's all water off a duck's back. It doesn't seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he's too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn't nearly as pleasant. After all, it's not just Harold that's being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn't just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it's also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.\nRead more",

Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it's the sense that you're making your own version of its story that marks it out.\nPeople are going missing on the island, and you've been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn't the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don't figure it out in time, you'll have to make a new character and try again. And if you're an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you'll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I'll even do it without getting stabbed.\nRead more",

This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I'm currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who's a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! \nNancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It's also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works.

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.\nDLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.\nImproving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.\n Read more",

The Dragon's Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.\nNot that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2's closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn't only grander, it's still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.\nRead more",

So it's great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian's fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I'm always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn't reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.\nRead more",

          "description": "Later this week, Payload Studios' open world vehicular survival builder TerraTech Worlds launches into early access. As the name implies, it's a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload's founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they're viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. \"The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward,\" Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. \"We're not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining.\" Rather, it's \"more of a reimagining\" of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision. \nRead more",

          "description": "I didn't have any particular expectations for Heart Machine's open world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, but I wasn't expecting it to feel so... broken-up, I guess. In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.\nThe aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, \"has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels\". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted. \nRead more",

Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.\nCarnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.\nRead more",

My years of GDC left me devestated by the full realisation of how bad Mexican food is in the UK and I'm still not over it. Even the 'fancy' tacos and burritos you find nowadays cannot stand up to whichever burrito joint was closest to the BART station, especially as those were $7 and you'll pay £15 for a bad burrito here. Just. God. I miss them. I miss them so much. And the grackles. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!\nRead more",

          "description": "Having spent close to 40 hours hanging out with Cloud and co. on my (entirely accidental) Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth holiday last week, I've been absolutely bowled over by the sheer size and scale of its big, open world map regions. I've only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it's immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I'm sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who's ever despaired at Noctis' seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…",

It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price.

On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.\nMy goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.\nRead more",

          "description": "Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. \nStill, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ministerstvo zdravotnictví ve spolupráci s DIA a ÚZIS představilo novou aplikaci EZKarta (𝕏): \"Aplikace nahrazuje dosavadní Tečku a přináší nové funkce, díky kterým se stává plnohodnotnou eHealth aplikací Ministerstva zdravotnictví. Bude tak tvořit bránu k novým službám elektronizace zdravotnictví a stane se komunikačním kanálem mezi s občany. První funkcí nové appky je Očkovací průkazka občana. EZKarta však bude postupně přinášet nové funkce, např. mapu poskytovatelů zdravotních služeb. EZKarta přinese uživatelům úsporu času v nakládání se zdravotnickou dokumentací a zvýší dostupnost elektronických služeb v oblasti zdravotnictví.\"",

Maybe you’re selling off your unneeded inventory in Dragon’s Dogma 2, and you’re going through as quickly as possible and don’t realize your cursor has moved over a required item, and suddenly it’s gone. Thankfully, there is a way to get it back.\n\n\nFor obvious reasons, I haven’t tried to sell every quest item I come across, but from my experience, Dragon’s Dogma 2 doesn’t do anything to stop you from selling something important. There’s no message to warn you that you’re about to do a dumb. Moreover, quest items have price tags. Some of them are significant. In fact, it can be worthwhile to sell them when you don’t need them anymore.\n\n\nAnyway, you probably know all that. You’re here because you need to get something back. All sold quest items are found at Ibrahim’s Scrap Shop in Checkpoint Rest Town in the far West of Vermund.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo get your items back, just talk to Ibrahim and you’ll get a list of options. Select View special finds and you’ll be taken to a normal shop window. Everything related to a quest that has been sold will be available to buy back, though the prices are higher than what you sold them for.\n\n\nThere are times when a quest item won’t show up here, and that’s when the item isn’t unique. In Vocation Frustration, for example, you need to get a greatsword and an archstaff to unlock the Warrior and Sorcerer vocations. If you sell one of these instead of returning it to the shopkeep, it won’t go back to Ibrahim’s Scrap Store. That’s because any greatsword will do, and they’re sold in the shop at Checkpoint Rest Town. This goes likewise for the soldier and noble disguise sets.\n\n\nMostly, be careful what you sell. I sold a book that I later needed, and it was hell to try and find again because it wasn’t a unique quest item. However, if you do sell something truly unique, you can get it back at Ibrahim’s Scrap Store.\n\nThe post How to regain lost or sold quest items in Dragon’s Dogma 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pawns are a very weird central mechanic in Dragon’s Dogma 2. Not only are they your party members, but other players pick them up to join on their adventures. It’s an exchange very unique to the series.\n\n\nAs such, when you make your Pawn, you not only want to fill a role in your overall party, but you also want to make them attractive to other characters. I mean that both in a literal, physical sense, but also vocation and specialization. \n\n\nIf you're making your main Pawn initially and are wondering what you should choose, it doesn't really matter. I'd recommend something of a different vocation from what you're playing. Regardless, you can easily change your Pawn's vocation later to suit your needs. They level up their vocation in the same way that you do.\n\n\nHowever, if you want to make your Pawn desirable for other players, there are ways.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest main pawn vocation\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a main pawn that both supports you and brings home the bacon (Rift Crystals), then that’s also difficult to answer.\n\n\nThe best suggestion I have is that, if your playstyle requires a specific kind of pawn at all times, then other players will need it, as well. Everyone has a different playstyle, and everyone is going to prefer different pawns. A mage, warrior, or fighter might be the most sought after, but I don’t think it will make a major difference. If you look at the standings for most popular pawns, there’s a vast assortment of vocations.\n\n\nIn my opinion, specialization and appearance of pawns are what matters most. For example, I try to always have a Woodland Wordsmith in my party in case we run into elves. Even if you don’t have access to a certain specialization, having one set makes your pawn more likely to stand out, as is having a weird or (weirdly enough) attractive pawn.\n\n\nBut again, everyone has different preferences, but hopefully I’ve given you some idea on how to best suit as many as possible.\n\nThe post Dragon’s Dogma 2 Best Pawn Vocations appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s how to get one in Stardew Valley. \n\n\nThe good news is that you don’t need to get to a particular point in the game as the recipe is available from the very beginning, though you will need to save up a bit if you’ve just started a new save file in honor of the 1.6 update. If you're getting a Dehydrator purely to please Mr Raccoon, you'll also need a Smoker.\n\n\nHow to get a Dehydrator in Stardew Valley\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are two routes you can go down if you want to get a Dehydrator - you can buy the recipe, or you can effectively steal one once you reach a certain early landmark point of the game. \n\n\nThe huge benefit of buying the recipe (aside from being free of the guilt that comes with obtaining one through theft) is that you can make as many Dehydrators as you like. It can be a bit of a pain to only have one of anything, so if you’re wanting a lot of Dried Fruit, this is the way to go. \n\n\nTo purchase the Dehydrator recipe, you can visit Pierre’s store at any point in the game and cough up 10,000 Gold. It’s right at the bottom of his list of wares, underneath the Saplings and to make a Dehydrator, you’ll need the following resources:\n\n\n\n30 Wood\n\n\n2 Clay\n\n\n1 Fire Quartz\n\n\n\nHowever, once you’ve earned 25,000 Gold and Demetrius comes to visit you asking to use your cave so that he can observe the local species, you do have a chance to get your hands on a single Dehydrator for free. Don’t judge me, I found this out by accident with a misclick.\n\n\nIf you opt for a Mushroom Cave, you’ll get a Dehydrator inside. Of course you can use it within the cave without any issue, but if you use your Pickaxe on it, the Dehydrator will go into your inventory and then you’re free to place it wherever you like.\n\nThe post How to get a Dehydrator in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 departs from the norm of standard games when it comes to save files. \n\n\nYou'll see that clearly from the main menu screen, which is missing a key feature that any player would be familiar with. We're talking about starting a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2, a simple yet complicated aspect of this new Capcom entry. \n\n\nHow do you start a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2?\n\n\nYou must manually delete your saves to start a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2. I know it's a bit unusual, but it was done this way to make your choices more impactful. For example, once the character creation is done, race cannot be adjusted afterward. This also includes the decisions made throughout the game, from siding with one character during a quest to winding up in jail. \n\n\nTo delete your Steam cloud saves for Dragon's Dogma 2, you'll need to locate the correct files. The console version isn't as tricky, as it only requires going to the settings and manually getting rid of them there. For a full breakdown, check out our guide on deleting saves. \n\n\nAlthough changes are limited in the game, a few exceptions exist, primarily with character creation and Vocations. Those who aren't entirely satisfied with their avatar may salvage their design through the barber. Of course, it won't showcase all the features of the initial character creator, but it still beats starting a new save for it. Vocations are completely changeable at any time, too, via the Vocation Guild. \n\n\nIf you want to start a new game in Dragon's Dogma 2 because of a \"wrong\" decision, you may have some luck with the 'Load from Last Inn Rest.' It will return the party to the last inn, potentially wiping out this mistaken choice. I recommend sleeping here before embarking on some big mission. Sometimes, it's easy to tell when a decision-making event is about to happen, especially when two characters are at odds. So, before progressing further in these quests, rest at an inn, just in case. \n\nThe post How to start a new game in Dragon’s Dogma 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There are many reasons why hiding your helmet could benefit you in Dragon's Dogma 2, from seeing your character's face to masking that your newest headpiece doesn't quite suit you. Let's talk about whether you can hide your helmet in Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\n\nCan you hide your helmet in Dragon's Dogma 2?\n\n\nNo, you can't hide your helmet in Dragon's Dogma 2. Once you equip a headpiece to your character or Pawn, its appearance will stay until you find and wear a new helmet. Similarly, you can't hide or change the appearance of equipment pieces like body and leg armor unless you equip different ones. \n\n\nWith this in mind, there are two options you can explore: using third-party mods at your own risk or not using a helmet at all. While modding has risks, such as downloading questionable files or corrupting your save, it's often a safe option that many players use to introduce quality-of-life fixes or new custom features.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, if you prefer a safer route, you can remove your helmet, sacrificing stats in the name of fashion. While this would significantly reduce your defensive stats and combat resistances, it's safe to do in towns with little combat and frequent cutscenes. To get rid of your helmet, head into your inventory, select your helmet, and pick \"Remove\". You'll un-equip your headpiece, allowing you to see your character or Pawn's face and hair.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you want high defensive stats and prefer keeping your helmet on, you can purchase more from armor merchants in major cities. Although this means you have to spend money to get better-looking equipment, it's worth it to transform a peculiar-looking hat into one worthy of charging into battle.\n\nThe post Can you hide your helmet in Dragon’s Dogma 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you choose to manually save it will make a manual save, but it acts more like an autosave than an actual save point that you can reload. The intent is for choices and decisions and their weight to matter, and Capcom clearly tried to prevent save scumming. Still, there may be situations when you want to manually delete saves.

The locations in which you can setup camp are strategically placed around the world, often in places where you'll face long stretches between the next town or another type of civilization. Camps can be a great opportunity to get a rest as well as advance time. Here's everything you need to know about camping in Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to setup Camp in Dragon's Dogma 2\n\n\nThere are essentially two requirements to setup a Camp in Dragon's Dogma 2. First off, you need to be at a Campsite. These are typically indicated by a burning campfire out in the world. When you approach and interact with the campfire, you'll be given the option to setup a camp.\n\n\nNext, you'll need some camping equipment like a Camping Kit in order to setup the Camp.\n\n\nAlso, you'll want to make sure you clear the area around the campsite from monsters and enemies. If you leave some around, they can attack you while camping which would disrupt the camping process and also destroy your camping equipment.\n\n\nWhy you should setup Camp\n\n\nWhen you setup and rest at a camp, you get several benefits. First, you'll replenish your Health and Magick. When you interact with the Camp you'll also get several options:\n\n\n\nRest to Morning — Will advance the time to morning. (Day)\n\n\nRest to Evening — Will advance the time to evening. (Night)\n\n\nEquip Skills — Equip and unequip Vocatiokn Skills for both your Arisen and Pawn.\n\n\n\nDespite the options, you can also equip skills at a campfire without actually setting up a Camp. Therefore, if you're looking to just change up your skills, you do not need a Camping Kit to do so.\n\n\nIdeally, you'll setup Camp to to heal up and advance the time to a certain point if you are far away from a town.\n\nThe post Dragon’s Dogma 2: Camp guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Vocation Guild trainer will tell you that it's possible to learn both the Warrior and Sorcerer vocations, but first, he has a task for you. Here's how to unlock the Warrior vocation in Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nVocation Frustration quest guide\n\n\nIf you speak to the Vocation Guild trainer, he will tell you that while the Vocation Guild has the capability of teaching Warrior and Sorcerer vocations, a current weapon shortage is preventing them from doing so. However, if you can bring him a weapon for said vocation—that is, a Archistaff for Sorcerer or a Greatsword for Warrior. He gives you a tip that a gang of goblins to the west ambushed a trade shipment that should have had a Greatsword on it, which is exactly what you need.\n\n\nIf you look at your map, to the west of Vernsworth you should now have a quest location marked that indicates where you can find the Greatsword. Simply head west out of Vernsworth and follow the road until you reach the area indicated, which is near Trevor Mine. You will have to take out a group of Goblins but as long as you have some Pawns with you—and really, you always should—you will have no problem taking them out.\n\n\nAfter taking out the Goblin's head for the chest they were guarding. Inside you will find a Greatsword, which is exactly what you needed. Head back to Vernsworth and speak to the Vocation Guild trainer to turn in the Vocation Frustration quest. You will have to handover the Greatsword, but doing so unlocks the Warrior vocation! If you choose to learn the Warrior vocation, you will actually be given the Greatsword back as a starter weapon to use with the vocation.

However, the masquerade is a fancy affair, and therefore you will need to dress in formal raiment as well as don a masquerade mask. Thankfully, Brant provides you with an Eventide Mask. But you will still need to know where to find formal raiment to wear for the masquerade in Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhere to find the Courtly Tunic\n\n\nYou don't have to look far to find the proper formal raiment. You can find the Courtly Tunic in the city of Vernworth. In the center of the Noble Quarter is the Watchhead's Home, which is where the tunic is located. You can find the exact location on the above map. I waited until night so I could be all sneaky-like, but it doesn't actually matter. \n\n\nOnce inside, proceed forward into the dining room and you will see a bag lying on the floor that you can interact with. This is the Courtly Tunic, which is the formal raiment required to attend the masquerade! Simply pick it up and you will now be able to equip it and the mask to attend the masquerade.\n\n\nIf you're like me, you're probably now trying to plot the perfect escape. After all, we essentially just stole someone's fancy clothes, right? However, it doesn't appear that this actually constitutes as theft in any way. You can simply walk right back out the way you came, right past the steward at the front, and back out into Vernworth.\n\n\nMeet back up with Brant at the tavern to confirm you have the new duds, and that will proceed the quest to the next part in which you actually attend the masquerade.

The Rising Tide will further expand on the game's story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. \nThe new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water.

We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.\nThe newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. \n\nShadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. \nShadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. \nDeveloped by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.\n\n\nStill Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. \nFor more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year.

That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. \"We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that's made to create DLCs or expansions,\" Vincke said. \"We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”\nNot only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons & Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that \"it's going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it's their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.\"\n\n\nWhile Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There's no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur's Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it's hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We'll have to wait and see. \nBaldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. \nAs for other Dungeons & Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there's a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze's in-development D&D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft's D&D survival sim. \nYou can read our review of Baldur's Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here. \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. \nFor some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn't share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception.

Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. \nThe show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. \n\n\nTo mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we're still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.",

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

It also has its first trailer and a release window.\nFirst announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nMarvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. \nMarvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown.

Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. \nNaturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. \n\n\nThe presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:\nBroly (Super Saiyan Full Power)\nBurter\nDyspo\nHit\nJeice\nKakunsa\nKale (Super Saiyan Berserk)\nMaster Roshi (Max Power)\nNappa\nSuper Trunks\nToppo\n\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a \"massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,\" so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.\nThis month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.\nHere's the rest of the line-up:\nWhat's Coming To Game Pass This Month\nLightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today\nMLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today\nThe Quarry (Cloud and Console) – March 20 | Our Review\nEvil West (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 21\nTerra Invicta (Game Preview) (PC) – March 26\nDiablo IV (Console and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nOpen Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28\nArk: Survival Ascended (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X|S) – April 1\nF1 23 (Cloud) EA Play – April 2\nSuperhot: Mind Control Delete (Cloud, Console, and PC) – April 2 | Our Review\nWhat's Leaving Game Pass On March 31\nHot Wheels Unleashed (Cloud, Console, and PC) | Our Review\nInfinite Guitars (Cloud, Console, and PC) \nMLB The Show 23 (Cloud and Console) | Our Review",

The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.\nProduced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.\n\nInterestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.\nIn addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.\nWill you be checking out this crossover set?

This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.\nDeveloped by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. \n\n\nRiven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It's so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. \nOutside of PC, it's unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target.

Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.\nCreated by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  \nThe game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”\n\n\nIn a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, \n“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”\nBalatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.",

With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it's great to hear the game will feature this mode. \nCheck out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game's photo mode for yourself below: \n\nBased on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. \n\"Photo mode returns in Senua's Saga: Hellblade II,\" a Ninja Theory tweet reads. \"Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week.\" \nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Senua's Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December.

It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an \"innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.\"\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. \nCurrently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature \"unique cooperative gameplay,\" the studio says. \n\"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,\" the announcement reads.\" \nThere's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. \nNews of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here. \nAre you excited about this game? Let us know in the comments below!",

You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. \nWhat's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. \nHowever, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. \nIt's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right.

Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a \"Shrieker Lair\" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like \"smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.\" \n\n\nShrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. \nKeep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game.

This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. \nSabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you'll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars' Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: \n\n\n\"Staying true to the game's core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars' grand adventure,\" a press release reads. \"The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon.\" \nAs you can see, Sabotage isn't quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Sea of Stars review, and then read Game Informer's Sea of Stars cover story for behind-the-scenes details about the game's development. \nAre you interested in Sea of Stars' three-player co-op mode?

          "description": "PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. \nThe biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
