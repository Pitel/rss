So, the lovely Alex and Felix on our YouTube channel have jumped head-first into the trailer and pulled out the juiciest details that might be a bit less obvious.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.\n  \nRead more",

Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.\nIts technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.\nRead more",

Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. \nRead more",

Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after.

I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies.

In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. \nIn Airborne Empire, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.\n Read more",

Finally, a game brave enough to ask: \"what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?\".\nIt's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.\nRead more",

You may well have thought of a recent exception too, since we've had a fair few 4Xeses experimenting with some of the standard formulae these last few years. It's been a while though since I read through every word of every faction's description and wanted to play all of them. Zephon captured my interest immediately.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that \"evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world\", and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening soulslike Tyrant’s Realm is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last June, Valve’s trading card game Artifact Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.\nRead more",

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.\r\n \nRead more",

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Hollow Nuke, also known as the Hollow Purple Nuke ability, is an extremely strong move in Jujutsu Infinite, but it's equally difficult to perform.\n\n\nThis move is associated with the Infinity Innate Technique, which is based on Gojo's abilities, and it takes a certain amount of expertise to perform it successfully. Certain prerequisites will have to be taken care of if you want to land the Hollow Nuke successfully.\n\n\nHow to perform Hollow Nuke in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nWhat makes Hollow Nuke a bit tricky is because of the fact that it's a combination of two separate moves. The Lapse Blue and Reversal Red are two separate abilities, but they combine to perform something truly special. However, haphazardly performing them isn't going to land the Hollow Nuke.\n\n\nFirstly, you'll need to learn how to chant, which isn't too hard. It's all about unlocking the ability to chant your moves. Once you chant, both the Lapse Blue and Reversal Red moves will appear in Purple. I always prefer to perform the Lapse Blue move first, followed by Reversal Red.\n\n\n\n\nYou must use shift lock while performing both moves because the Blue orb produced by Lapse Blue will have to stay in the air. Once you have performed that, perform the Reversal Red to create a Red Orb. This will have to be done very quickly so that the Blue Orb can combine with the Red Orb.\n\n\nIf you manage to do it correctly, the Blue Orb will combine with the Red, and your entire screen will turn Purple. The move does a massive amount of AoE damage that's equally good in both PvE and PvP. If you're struggling to clear a bunch of enemies, landing this particular move can ease your job a lot.\n\n\nIn general, the Infinity technique is among one of the very best currently available in Jujutsu Infinite. If you can unlock its maximum Six Eyes move, the technique becomes even more powerful in terms of potential damage to enemies across all game modes. \n\nThe post How to use Hollow Nuke in Jujutsu Infinite appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, there are eight new species added to the Bestiary, and they're tied with the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest.\n\n\nHow to start the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest in Fisch\n\n\nThis weekend's actions take place at the newly launched Grand Reef Island in Fisch. Once you reach the island, you'll notice areas where a storm is taking place (marked by the whirlpools). You'll find a Pirate Ship parked close to these whirlpools. Jump on the ship and you'll meet Captain Neptune on it.\n\n\nOnce you talk with him, you'll receive the only task of this mini-quest.\n\n\n\n\nHow to complete the Atlantean Storm Pirate Quest in Fisch\n\n\nOnce you've begun the quest, you'll have to complete the Atlantean Storm Bestiary. This Bestiary includes eight permanent fishes of varying rarities. To catch them, you'll have to fish in the regions where the whirlpools are situated. Make sure to check out this guide, which details all eight species that you'll need to find.\n\n\nDo note that the fish spawn at all times, but you'll have to alter your setup based on which species you want to find. Once you complete the Bestiary, head back to the Pirate Ship. Talk to Captain Neptune and inform him that you have completed the Bestiary.\n\n\nYou'll get x4 Hangman's Hook, x5 Kraken Tentacle, and a Drifter's Tale Bobber by completing the quest.

Yet, there's a backdoor approach you can take to catch this peculiar species.\n\n\nHow to catch Secret Banana Fish in Fisch\n\n\nThe Banana Fish is elusive for a reason, as it's a Developer/Admin fish. In simpler terms, it's not a part of the official Bestiary associated with any region, and cannot be caught by normal players. It can only be caught either by admins or by content creators who are directly partnered for producing Fisch-related content.\n\n\nInterestingly, there was even a wiki page stating the steps to take if you wanted to catch this fish. Since then, the page has been taken down, but there might be plans for the Banana Fish to be added to the Fisch Bestiary in the future. If you're unwilling to wait, here's all the information you need to know.\n\n\n\nName: Banana\n\n\nRarity: Secret\n\n\nLocation: Ancient Isle\n\n\nWeather: Rain\n\n\nVersions: 2 (Shiny and Standard)\n\n\nSeason: Summer\n\n\nTime: None\n\n\nPreferred Bait: None\n\n\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen if the developers will add the Banana Fish to the official Bestiary. For a long time, the Travis Scott Secret Fish wasn't available in the full game, but it was later added for the public. Once added, we will add more information to this piece regarding how you can add it to your Bestiary.\n\nThe post Can you catch the Secret Banana Fish in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Dimensional Finger is one of the several items available inside Jujutsu Infinite, but the game doesn't make it clear how you can obtain it.\n\n\nThere are certain items you can also craft from the Crafting Station, and this also includes a few Special Grade drops. However, the Dimensional Finger item can't be crafted with the help of any other resource. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this specific item in the first place and what's its best use-case scenario in Jujutsu Infinite.\n\n\nHow to obtain Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nTo get Dimensional Finger, you'll have to clear the main storyline. You'll come across different NPCs who are directly linked with the main set of quests. Interacting with them allows you to start and complete different quests and unlock a variety of rewards.\n\n\nYour first opportunity to obtain Dimension Finger can be found in Shijo Town's Level 30 quests, where you'll need to defeat the Rogue Sorcerer. Once you defeat the Sorcerer, you'll be able to get a Dimensional Finger.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nThe Dimensional Finger is required to travel across different portals. These portals are found in the villages, and you'll need the item in discussion to shift through them. Once you enter the rifts, you'll find different Cursed Spirits and other types of enemies. Once you take them down, you'll get a lot of credits and XP.\n\n\nAdditionally, taking down these enemies also helps you to get more valuable rewards like Cursed Tools and Special Grade items. Of course, the rewards won't be the same in every run, but entering and clearing these portals is pretty rewarding in general. Whenever you have a Dimensional Finger and come across a portal, make sure to enter and clear out the enemies.\n\nThe post How to get and use the Dimensional Finger in Jujutsu Infinite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

          "description": "Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

          "description": "Z \"Párty Hárd\" jsem byl nadšen, ale tohle jako kdyby natočil (a především napsal) někdo úplně jiný. Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen \"věci na jistotu\" jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)",

Ale je to výrazně snesitelnější než \"Oni a Silvio\", především proto, že hlavní hrdinka to celé nějakým smysluplným způsobem spojuje. (Ilča 60 %)",

          "description": "Následuje neupravovaný text zajímavého prohlášení, které vydal můj oblíbenec Varhan Orchestrovič Bauer k nové verzi slovenské hymny:\n\n\nS úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny \"Nad Tatrou sa blýská\" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
