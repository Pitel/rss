          "description": "Oh biscuits!\nGiven Bluey’s meteoric rise since the show's television debut in 2018, it seemed inevitable that a video game adaptation would eventually make its way into the hands of eager fans worldwide. Thanks to developer Artax Games and publisher Outright, that adaptation is now here, with Bluey: The Videogame letting you directly control each member of the Heeler family: Bandit, Chilli, Bingo, and of course, Bluey. It’s a charming effort that manages to successfully emulate the Australian cartoon in terms of visuals and audio, but falls deeply short of capturing the same magic. Despite this, young children will still likely get a kick out of the experience, but more on that later.\nTaking place across five locations from the show, including the Heeler household, the backyard, the beach, the playground, and the creek, Bluey: The Videogame tells a short, reasonably wholesome story in which the family goes in search of Bandit’s lost childhood treasure. When we say “short”, however, we mean it: the game’s story is split into four episodes, and each of these will take roughly around 10-15 minutes to complete. So you can make your way through the entire game in about an hour, tops. Add in the various collectibles and you might be able to stretch it to two hours, but that’s it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

To mark this historic Hyrulean occasion, we'll be running articles throughout the week dedicated to the game, our memories, and its legacy. Today, Ollie sings the praises of Ocarina of Time's mystical opening location, Kokiri Forest...\n\nBefore Ocarina of Time launched back in 1998, the Legend of Zelda franchise didn’t really provide players with a good opportunity to acclimatise to its world. Think about it: both NES games threw you into the middle of Hyrule with little introduction, A Link to the Past saw you almost immediately infiltrate Hyrule Castle’s dungeon, and while Link’s Awakening started off in the cosy confines of Tarin’s house, it's not long before you're on the beaches of Koholint Island, surrounded by Sand Crabs, Leevers, and Octoroks.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A Rare find.\nIt was almost 10 years ago that a group of former Rare developers got together and established Playtonic Games. This was a team consisting of many of the minds behind Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country, and other such classics, so when their first title, Yooka-Laylee was released in 2017, we were relieved to see that level of creativity still very much alive and kicking (even more so with the improved Switch version later that year).\nPlaytonic would go on to release the side-scrolling platformer Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair in 2019, a title that we felt took all of the best bits of its predecessor and improved on them — awarding it a 9/10 in our review, no less. While the studio has since been behind several games on the publishing side of things (Lil Gator Game, Demon Turf, and many more) a good few years have passed since it was last in the development seat.

This story-driven RPG is ideal for fans of titles like Undertale and EarthBound. Don’t take that comparison to mean that it is identical to these games, though — it’s still its own experience.\nRight off the bat, In Stars and Time looks great, with 4:3 aspect ratio that makes it feel more retro than it actually is. The music is gentle and soothing, and it pairs perfectly with the monochrome art style. The menu and settings are easy to navigate from the off, and the story starts with a detailed trigger warning; the game does have some text-based depictions of topics like suicide, which is worth being mindful of. Nothing is shown, but the dialogue is intense in places.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That's because it's a Metroidvania platformer and, when it is time for back-and-forth combat, you're not choosing attacks from a menu. Instead you're stringing together combos in real-time, then when your alotted attack time is over, you're parrying enemy assaults with rhythmic flair. \r\n\nSo, turn-based, yes, but with a twist.

They get tangled, they trip you up, and they're generally a nuisance. No wonder Darth Vader was grumpy all the time. He was full of wires.\r\n\n\r\nFew manufacturers understand this better than Logitech, whose G915 Lightspeed Wireless keyboard has been the ideal way to type without tethers for years. It combines a slim yet robust build quality with wonderfully tactile keys, incredibly fast response times, respectable battery life, and a truly standout volume wheel. Perhaps for that reason, the G915 Lightspeed has also maintained its lofty price point, with an RRP of around £220. But as part of Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can currently grab the best wireless keyboard for almost half price. It's currently available for £125 in the UK, and $160 in the US, which is 46% and 36% off respectively.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's meta as in the overall balance of power between Modern Warfare 3 loadouts, playstyles and so forth based on a variety of factors such as map design, rather than the Alan Wake 2 kind of \"meta\", where characters talk about how they're just characters in a game and so on. I would dearly like to see some crossover between these types of \"meta\". I guess the Call of Duty that comes closest to fulfilling that idea is Black Ops 3, with its fourth-wall-breaking cyborg theatrics.\r\n\n\r\nAnyway, the discussion is interesting because it touches on the fact that the evolution of an FPS competitive meta is an artful balance of prediction and reaction, imposing new directions on players at times, taking direction from them at others. The developers want the Modern Warfare 3 meta to change \"from season to season\" - the question, of course, is how to do this without alienating fans of certain weapons and strategies.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.\nAs such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.\nRead more",

Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. \nOnly this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.\nRead more",

But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.\nBut then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again. \nRead more",

Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes.

Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. \r\n\n\r\nAccording to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's simple, satisfying work that's designed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside without having to think too hard.

Speaking to me during a showing of Ara - which is notable among turn-based 4X games for playing out every player's turn simultaneously - the creators offered a rousing characterisation of the genre, suggesting that strategy games have somewhat shucked off their association with stifling complexity and elitism, thanks not least to the recent influence of board gaming.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.\r\n\n\r\nYou can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Making a strategy game is \"harder than people give it credit for,\" Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it \"late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles,\" but it's also \"suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have,\" he says. \nEven now, \"it's got some catching up to do,\" he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that \"there's a thirst for something different now,\" both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. \"We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.'

          "description": "Robert Kirkman's Invincible is a comic book and lately, animated series about a young superhero finding his feet in a world where superheroes routinely get decapitated, disembowelled, melted, squished or just plain old beaten to a pulp. Much like The Boys, it's got a not-very-nice version of Superman, Omni-Man, who you might have seen doing not-very-nice things in Mortal Kombat lately.\nSkybound and Kirkman's first videogame based on the license isn't about Omni-Man, though. Developed by Terrible Posture Games, it's about Atom Eve, a high-school do-gooder who can manipulate the atomic structure of the world, changing one thing into another.\nRead more",

Victory is dependent on rapidly issuing movement, attack and ability commands to several small squads of soldiers, and your units will pay a heavy price if your attention leaves them for more than a few moments.\r\n\nIf that's not your thing, move along. If it is, Realms Of Ruin is a solid, button-down war 'em up and you should read on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. \r\n\nThe gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Hard-nosed private eye Rachel (RPS in peace) pronounced herself fascinated but a little stumped by it, back in April, while Graham described it as his \"ideal game\" in a post about the recent addition of infidelity cases and lost-and-found jobs, adding to my suspicions that Graham is some kind of jigsaw killer and that his news posts are actually ciphered confessions of his terrible crimes.\nWell, these already viscous plots are about to thicken into a borderline-immobile soup of intrigue, for ColePowered Games are adding modding tools to the game. These will allow you to pen your own detective mysteries, and even alter the surrounding city to fit.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It appears the next Subnautica game is diving deep sometime in early 2025. It's been roughly two years since fans dove into the chilly waters of the series, and it feels like it's nearly time to strap back into that diving suit once more. And then get eaten by a Reaper Leviathan.\n\n\nAs spotted by RPS, the game's potential launch window came out of a recent financial report by publisher Krafton. Details are sparse and will continue to be so until the company is ready to announce the game proper. It's currently unknown if the next Subnautica in 2025 is set to be a spin-off or sequel, but judging by the development time, it's likely going to be the latter. Of course, that's just speculation. But isn't it fun to imagine?\n\n\nYeah, I take it back. Image via Unknown Worlds Entertainment\n\n\nThe next Subnautica game set to terrify in 2025\n\n\nThe next Subnautica has been in the works for some time now. We last heard of it back in April 2022 when developer Unknown Worlds advertised a Senior Narrative Designer position on Twitter. Since then, fans of its signature undersea horror themes have been waiting to know more. If the game is scheduled for a release in the first half of 2025, I wouldn't expect to see any reveal until Summer Game Fest next year at the very earliest. It should at least make for a good addition to a prediction list. \n\n\nAs noted by RPS, the financial report covered some future Krafton projects. Project Gold Rush is an \"Action-Adventure Sandbox\" set to launch in the first half of 2025, much like the new Subnautica. The publisher also listed a Dark and Darker mobile game, Project inZOI, and Project Black Budget all under development for 2024. \n\nThe post The next Subnautica game will apparently pull you under in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Like many video game hobbyists, I’ve had dreams of making a game of my own. Before I was even in high school, I had a binder full of designs for a game I had dreamt up, but I never really got the means to even attempt to make it. Programming has always bored me, and I tend to get frustrated with art. Even attempts at small projects to just motivate myself with some visible progress fizzled.\n\n\nThe closest I got was a brief stint writing for a game company. I co-wrote a game that is still unannounced and may, at this point, be canceled. I’m not sure. However, I got the gig at the lowest point of my life, and it gave me something to focus on. I’ve always wanted to return to doing it, but again, there’s a wall I have to climb over to make any progress.\n\n\nJordan Weisman is among those looking t…",

Most notably, Epic is offering a 33% off coupon during the sale, which can be applied toward Alan Wake 2. \n\n\nThe Epic Coupon can be used throughout the event. It lets buyers take 33% off any checkout purchase that rings up to $14.99 or more. Even though Alan Wake 2 is already set at a reasonable $49.99, using the coupon during the sale will drop it to an even more reasonable $33.49 USD. I may be biased, but that's a damn good deal for a very recently launched GOTY contender. It's a fantastic game that can last you up to around 30 hours. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 and more are on sale at the Epic Games Store\n\n\nThe Epic Coupon seems to be pretty much the sale of the Epic Games Store Black Friday sale. You can find a host of games at a discount, but the coupon itself seems to be what's taking off the big, meaty chunks. The rules of the coupon state that it can be used at checkout, and you'll get another every time you \"complete an eligible transaction.\" And by that, Epic means any purchase, solo or combined, that adds up to $14.99 or more. Likely, that means you can apply it to Assassin's Creed Mirage Deluxe Edition, even though it's already listed at 20% off. \n\n\nHaving both games already on such a steep sale isn't such bad news. The year has been full of bangers, so some may at least appreciate the softer hit on their wallets. \n\n\nThe Epic Games Store Black Friday sale lasts from November 21 at 11 am ET to November 28 at 10:59 am ET. \n\n\nAt the other side of the aisle, the Steam Store has also started Black Friday shenanigans with its Autumn Sale, which also lasts until November 28.\n\nThe post You can get 33% off on Alan Wake 2 during Epic Game Store’s Black Friday sale appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 players rejoice, because Sledgehammer Games has announced it will be temporarily disabling the infamous Gaia Operator outfit, known in the community as the “Groot” skin, so it can make some changes. \n\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA, the developer said “adjustments” for this outfit are “in the pipeline.” In response to one user asking what the studio’s plans were regarding the “problems [the skin] has brought forward to [Modern Warfare 3] from [Modern Warfare 2],” it responded confirming the fixes were incoming, and that the Gaia and Gaia Blackcell Operator skins will be disabled in a future update until the changes are ready to be deployed.\n\n\nThe Gaia / “Groot” skin has been plaguing Modern Warfare 2 players since its launch in late-September alongside Season 6. While it does closely resemble the tree-like creature in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, it’s advertised as “an earthen form of Mother Nature herself.” It would seem the major issue most players have with this skin is that, due to the nature of being a bundle of tree branches, the camouflage allowed it to blend in too well with its surroundings.\n\n\nThe alternate skin for Nova was adjusted in an October 11 patch which “added VFX to base skin that reflects the same level of visibility as BlackCell skin,” and “improved visibility compensation,” but some fans aren’t happy. Since the skin has made the jump to Modern Warfare 3, fans have taken to Reddit to accuse the skin of being pay-to-win and questioning how it hasn’t been fixed yet. Here’s hoping the team at Sledgehammer Games gives this skin a complete overhaul and alleviates players’ concerns. Because I think the skin looks really neat — if only it could not be broken on a fundamental level. \n\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3’s Gaia skin is getting temporarily pulled appeared first on Destructoid.",

The online playtest is for EVE Vanguard, the upcoming sandbox FPS module that will connect to the long-running MMORPG EVE Online.\n\n\nImage via CCP Games\n\n\nPersistent Universe with EVE Online\n\n\nAccording to CCP Games, EVE Vanguard will connect directly to the EVE universe from Day One with a persistent new world. Players in Vanguard will be able to fuel the ongoing wars in the EVE Online MMO allowing players to add corruption to the frontlines, deliver vital resources to the EVE economy, and complete contracts to alter the tides of battles.\n\n\nThe playtest will last for four days, beginning at midday UTC on December 7 and ending at midday UTC on December 11. Any EVE Online Omega subscriber will have the opportunity to join the playtest by choosing EVE Vanguard character profile via the EVE launcher once the playtest begins.\n\n\nNew Patch for Havoc\n\n\nAlongside news of the EVE Vanguard playtest, CCP Games also revealed an upcoming patch for the latest EVE Online expansion, Havoc. Highlights of the patch include:\n\n\n\nLifted restrictions on EverMark trading, reinstating players’ in-game transaction freedoms.\n\n\nDynamic, in-game music that adapts to the unfolding narratives of corruption and suppression.\n\n\nQuality of Life improvements for Corporation Projects.\n\n\n\nI'm excited to see what EVE Vanguard is all about. Years ago when CCP Games tried this before with Dust 514, the concept itself was very intriguing but felt like maybe it was a bit before its time. Now, however, technology is in the right place to make a truly persistent online shooter that ties in directly with an ongoing MMORPG.\n\n\nThose interested in EVE Vanguard can check out more on its official website.\n\nThe post EVE Vanguard FPS will have a playtest in a couple of weeks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The World Ends With You fan artist @caehum on Twitter has showcased what Neku would look like in an HD remake or possibly Kingdom Hearts 4 through an immaculate 3D render. Since its publishing on Monday, it has received over 2,500 likes.\n\n\n\n\nThe 3D model looks like it's ripped straight from a modern Kingdom Hearts game, and has plenty of detail around the face and the odd jacket that Neku wears. The more realistic take on Neku is quite different from the most recent game NEO: The World Ends With You, which takes on a graphic novel art style instead. \n\n\nThe World Remade With You\n\n\nIt would be cool to see a realistic take on the original DS game through a remake in the future. It has been re-released on Switch with a Final Remix version, however, to mixed results. \n\n\n\"Final Remix‘s failure to utilize the extent of the Switch hardware shows a lack of understanding as to why so many people consider the Nintendo DS original to be the masterpiece it is,\" said our review.\n\n\n\n\nNeku is expected to appear in Kingdom Hearts 4 by some fans. In Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance, Neku and Sora promise to see each other in Shibuya. After the events of KH3, Sora actually ends up in an area inspired by the real-life location. We could see Neku in a model like this, in an official capacity.\n\n\nIf you don't know where Neku comes from, he's the main character of a cult classic JRPG called The World Ends With You. It's one of the highest-rated DS games at an 88 Metacritic score. There was then a follow-up sequel called NEO: The World Ends With You featuring a new character named Rindo. \n\n\n\"NEO: The World Ends with You is a sequel worth waiting for,\" said our 8/10 review. \"It brings together many of the best concepts from the DS original but in a more approachable and accessible experience.\"\n\nThe post The World Ends With You fan artist shows what Neku could look like in an HD remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

Both will be available together on consoles and sold separately on Steam. There's no release date in place, but PQube has them penciled in for an early 2024 launch. You can see how the updated RPGs look today in the announcement trailer. \n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Zero Div's series first opened its doors to students when the original Class of Heroes hit PSP in Japan back in 2008. A North American release followed in 2009, which is also when the sequel launched in Japan. The Anniversary Edition version of the first game made its debut in Switch in Japan in 2018, adding in a room for changing outfits, difficulty options, and more.\n\n\nClass of Heroes 2G introduced some new features when it made its way to PlayStation 3 in 2010. Additional party members, new dungeons, and full voiceovers joined the mix, giving players more reason to go back to the grind. With both games combined there are over 175 dungeons to traverse, so now's a good time to invest in some knee and elbow pads if you plan on crawling through 'em all.\n\nThe post Class of Heroes 1 & 2: Complete Edition brings the adventures back on PS5, Switch, and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition to providing the artwork featuring an animated version of the rapper, the leaker also claims LEGO will make an appearance, and there'll also be a rhythm mode and racing mode. \n\n\nAccording to @HYPEX, the rhythm mode will let you play vocals, guitar, drums, and bass.

What a rollercoaster it's been for CD Projekt Red's non-Witcher game, and soon you'll be able to own a special Ultimate Edition version of the dystopian RPG.\n\n\nIn a recent post on CDPR's website, the developer has said it will be launching the Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. It's releasing digitally and as a physical purchase, both of which will be available from December 5.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what's in it, well, you'll get the OG game (natch), along with the free 2.0 update that overhauled a lot of stuff, and the one and only DLC, Phantom Liberty. It's basically an all-in-one package, if that's what you're after in time for Christmas.\n\n\nWe can forgive, but can we forget?\n\n\nAs time goes on, it becomes easier to talk about Cyberpunk without having to remind ourselves of the bad old days. However, I'd wager it's a sting that's still felt by many, especially for those of us who tried to play it on console when it released.\n\n\nThings are, thankfully, much different now. The aforementioned 2.0 update was just one of the ways CD Projekt Red made some key changes to the game, improving things along the way. Before that was the rather substantial patch 1.5 that rolled out in February 2022.\n\n\nIn short: we've finally arrived. However, it's at a time when the studio is looking to move onto new things. While we're getting a Cyberpunk follow-up and a new Witcher saga, CDPR has also said that 2077 is getting no more major updates.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 is getting an Ultimate Edition next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Petroglyph Games is still patching Star Wars: Empire at War all these years later. The game originally launched in 2006. The newest patch was released on November 20, 2023.\n\n\nThe latest patch is for maintenance, but it makes a rather significant change: it shifts the game from a 32-bit executable to a 64-bit one to try and solve out-of-memory bugs. Beyond that, it addresses out-of-sync multiplayer issues and “numerous gameplay fixes addressing balance and incorrect unit behavior.”\n\n\nIt’s impressive. Some of my favorite games of that era aren’t even available for purchase anymore, let alone getting continued support. Petroglyph states that they worked with the community to locate and address some of the bugs fixed in this release.\n\n\nImage via Steam\n\n\nI’m somewhat surprised that they’re still able to patch the game. Not that I think Petroglyph wouldn’t want to since it was the studio’s first game and one that still gets played today. It’s just that, since the license belongs to another company, oftentimes there’s little incentive to offer continued support and other times they’re contractually not allowed to make changes after a certain period. Nevertheless, such a major update so long after Star Wars: Empire at War’s initial release is an impressive showing of passion from the developer. In a world without official Battlefield 1942 servers, it's nice to be reminded that some people still care.\n\n\nWhile I was in high school playing StarCraft, I dreamed of a Star Wars RTS. I don’t know why I didn’t play Star Wars: Galactic Battleground, but by 2006, the prequel trilogy had left me badly disillusioned with the franchise. I have never recovered, and at this point, probably never will.\n\n\nHowever, I may install Star Wars: Empire at War to check the game out now.\n\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War is available for PC. The newest update is available now.\n\nThe post 17 years later, Petroglyph is still patching Star Wars: Empire at War appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Back in 2021, it was announced that Knights of the Old Republic would be getting an official remake, with plans to release it on PC and PS5. However, things have not been going swimmingly for KOTOR's return, and if you've clicked on this headline, you already know where this is going.\n\n\nA few days ago, Giant Bomb's own Jeff Grubb claimed that \"this game is not being worked on right now.\" And by \"this game,\" he definitely means the remake of Knights of the Old Republic. He goes on to say that no studio anywhere is currently developing it. The discussion begins around the 31-minute mark.\n\n\n\n\nGrubb also adds that fans may have already been picking up the pieces, and it certainly seems like Embracer Group is sitting on this long-awaited game. However, nothing official has been claimed yet regarding the remake, so take this information at face value for now.\n\n\nEmbrace for disappointment\n\n\nKOTOR is in the care of Saber Interactive, which is owned by Embracer Group. Last week, Embracer CEO was not willing to pass comment on the status of Knights of the Old Republic. And last year, there was another report about the remake being put on hold, so at this stage, it's safe to assume the project is likely in development hell.\n\n\nIt's a bit of a shame really. The original 2003 release – which was made by BioWare of Mass Effect fame – is considered to be one of the best Star Wars video adaptations of all time. To see it make a comeback at a time when remakes and remasters are still in vogue feels like Embracer with its figurative finger so far from the pulse, it's levitating.\n\nThe post Knights of the Old Republic remake ‘not being worked on,’ report claims appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sometimes an indie game can come out of nowhere and cover itself in glory, even for a bit. Zeekerss co-op survival horror title Lethal Company is just such a game, and it's currently taking the PC world by storm.\n\n\nAccording to the latest Top Sellers chart over on Steam, it's ranking as the best game in terms of revenue. This puts it at the number two spot overall, just behind the Steam Deck. Seeing it climb up from sixth place in a matter of weeks is hugely impressive, especially because there seemed to be little hype surrounding it.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nIt was also revealed yesterday that Lethal Company had smashed 100,000 concurrent players. Well, according to data pulled from SteamDB, that record has been smashed again. At the time of writing, it's now at a peak of 117,278, which it achieved less than 12 hours ago.\n\n\nPretty good going for a small indie title\n\n\nSons of the Forest experienced a similar burst in popularity so quickly after it was released. Selling two million copies in its first 24 hours, the follow-up to the 2017 horror game The Forest was a phenomenal success. Admittedly, it didn't last too long, and there are currently 6,618 people playing right now. In contrast, Lethal Company is recording just over 19,000 players.\n\n\nFor those who have yet to play it (yo!), Lethal Company is a cooperative horror title that tasks players with scavenging items on abandoned moons in order to sell them to an entity known as the Company.\n\n\nIt's been out for a month and it's already showing \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews on Steam. It's still in early access so no doubt the studio has a lot of work ahead of it. Still, this surprise horror hit is something fans of the genre may want to keep an eye on, especially those who enjoy things like Rust or Dead by Daylight.\n\nThe post Lethal Company is now the top-selling game on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The company decided not to miss the intended release date for the game despite possible problems but has since adopted a different stance. Colossal just announced that the DLC will be delayed while the company works on fixing the game's performance troubles.\n\n\n\n\nIn a long developer note, Colossal Order informs of the company's main goals moving forward. In summation, those are:\n\n\nPerformance improvements - which will focus on getting better GPU performance. The current version of the game infamously features too much detail, and fans have criticized it for rendering stuff as useless as teeth that you never see. The teeth are, reportedly, not the issue, but the team is aware that the performance needs improving.\n\n\nBug fixes - the developers are working hard on over 100 instances of reproducible bugs reported by the community.\n\n\nEditor and Mod support - the developers are working on improving the map editor as well as its interface before they do a proper release.\n\n\nCities Skylines 2 post-launch roadmap\n\n\nThe company doesn't have a release date for the upcoming content but has presented a broad window.\n\n\nImage by Colossal Order\n\n\n\nThe Asset pack has been delayed to Q1 2024 (from Q4 2023)\n\n\nThe Creator packs have been delayed to Q2 2024 (from Q1 2024)\n\n\nThe expansion is still set to release during Q2 2024\n\n\nThe post Cities: Skylines 2 DLC delayed so studio can focus on PC fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

The subscription service is adding free trials for a bizarre duo: Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Lord of the Rings Gollum. \n\n\nLOTR fans will get to check out Gollum for a full hour, and based on the game’s terrible reception, that might be more than enough time with it. Gollum has a Top Critic Score of just 37 on OpenCritic, with only 4% of critics recommending it. \n\n\nFollowing the game’s release in May 2023, publisher Daedlic Entertainment closed its development studio in Hamburg, Germany and canceled its plans for another game set in Middle-Earth. Now, any PlayStation players who skipped out on the game thanks to the rough reviews can get a chance to evaluate it for themselves.\n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3, on the other hand, is one of the most celebrated games of the year. The massive CRPG has been blowing everyone away since it debuted in August. It earned eight nominations at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year and Best Game Direction for Larian Studios. \n\n\nIt’s one of those games that stays deeply engaging even after hundreds of hours, so the two hour trial coming to PlayStation Plus Premium will hardly be enough for players to get a taste of what the game has to offer. That said, the opening hours are exciting enough that the trial will likely snag more than a few new players for the game. \n\n\nBoth of the trials are currently available through the PlayStation Store. \n\nThe post PlayStation Plus Premium gets trials for Baldur’s Gate 3 and LOTR Gollum appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After Enclave HD made its way to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch back in June, a December 5 date has been locked in for PlayStation 5.\n\n\nSomehow, it's been over two decades since the original Enclave launched on Xbox in 2002. The medieval action-RPG was developed by Starbreeze Studios, and the HD version from TopWare Interactive and Ziggurat Interactive adds in updated visuals, an enhanced soundtrack, and some quality-of-life improvements. The results might not exactly be the most PS5 looking game in the world, but it does include exclusive haptic trigger effects for the DualSense controller. \n\n\nYou can see some quick action-packed footage in the PS5 release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nEnclave lets you fight as either a goodie or a baddie — very real technical terms — with six class options available for each faction. The story puts you in the land of Celenheim, which experienced a rift between the forces of Light and Darkness a thousand years ago. The rift protected Celenheim's people from the vile Dreg'Atar, but now that it's beginning to close that peace could soon come to an end. Thus, it's time for everyone's favorite \"unlikely\" hero to rise up! Or you could just be a nasty lil' champion of evil. It's up to you.\n\n\nIt's been about, oh, 20 years since I played Enclave myself, but I remember it being a pretty engrossing and challenging game at the time. I haven't played the HD version yet, so I can't personally say how well it holds up in 2023.

In fact, according to Steam Charts, the horror experience has reached a peak player total of 114,672 at the time of writing.\n\n\n\n\n“While I was asleep Lethal Company passed 100,000 concurrent players,” the developer wrote in a post on Twitter. “Unbelievable, thank you for playing. Releasing updates for this game will be very fun.”\n\n\nLethal Company entered Early Access on Steam on October 23, so the fact that less than a month later it’s celebrating over 100,000 concurrent players is kind of amazing, especially for a game made by a solo developer who got their start on the Roblox platform.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the peak players announcement, Zeekerss wrote via Twitter that Lethal Company’s “next enemy is seasonal,” but the developer made certain to clarify they used the word “enemy” intentionally. “These ones will not be 'creatures' as I refer to the rest. These are Enemies. Antagonists. Combatants. Foes. Enjoy this pre-invasion time.”\n\n\nIn the replies, one user asked if their usage of the word “seasonal” implied the new enemy would only be present in the game temporarily. Zeekerss clarified that their use of the word “seasonal” was meant to suggest the enemy itself will be themed around the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\nLethal Company entered Early Access on October 23. In the co-op experience, players must salvage from “abandoned, industrialized moons” in order to fulfill their obligations to a mysterious “Company.” But, there’s a reason it’s co-op — while you’re hunting scrap, something else is hunting you.

The device's HDR OLED display is definitely its strongest feature, but there's more to it than just that.\n\n\nMore specifically, the graphics and tech analysis authority Digital Foundry has performed some in-depth testing of the Steam Deck OLED. \"In receiving an impressive upgrade to its display, Steam Deck OLED attacks input lag seemingly on two fronts,\" says Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter. \n\n\nLeadbetter explains that not only is the OLED \"typically\" about 10 milliseconds faster than the old LCD display during regular use, but that its 90Hz refresh rate also plays into this, as a game that's been capped at just 30 FPS…",

          "description": "In a post on Twitter, Square Enix revealed that the previously mobile-only title Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis has been published to Steam and will be released on the platform later. The Gacha-style game revisits the story of Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core while also telling a new original story about Sephiroth in his younger days.\n\n\n\n\nSOLDIER 1st Class\n\n\nOur very own Timothy \"The Wordsmith\" Monbleau wrote about his feelings on Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis when it was released on mobile devices a couple of months ago. I've also had the chance to play quite a bit of it—well, completed all the original content in the title, at least—and can say everything he mentions is pretty on point. Even though the idea of more FF7 is always appealing...this isn't the way to do it. FF7:EC feels like a gacha game was developed and then a FF7 skin was thrown onto it.\n\n\nHowever, I know even with the warning, some people just want more Final Fantasy. Even though you could previously access Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis through emulators like BlueStacks, this will be the first time it's easily and officially available on PC. New players who jump in on the Steam version will also get the pre-order rewards that were available on mobile. The rewards will help you get a jump start on progressing through the early missions, so it's a cool touch that they are giving the rewards to PC players as well.\n\n\nThere's no release date yet for when Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis will actually go live on Steam. According to the Twitter post, the release date will be announced soon.\n\n\n\nThe post Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is coming to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's hard to imagine, and it's even harder to imagine it's still going strong, as evidenced by recent statistics.\n\n\nSpurred by this milestone birthday, Half-Life has received an influx of players, with SteamDB reporting the game's highest player count on record. Over the last 24 hours, 33,471 players have jumped back into the world of Black Mesa, the most it's ever achieved, according to the history.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nGoing back as far as possible, the graph shows that, aside from a few spikes here and there, the game has retained a fairly steady flow of players. Until recently, of course. At the time of writing, nearly 19,000 people are playing right now. That's more than Starfield.\n\n\nThat's a lot of resonance cascades\n\n\nIt's no secret why Half-Life is experiencing a boon right now. To go with the 25th anniversary, Valve released a new update for the game, as well as a special documentary about the development of this absolute classic.\n\n\nAs such, it's on a lot of people's minds right now, and understandably so. Featuring one of the most iconic openings in an FPS, Half-Life raised the bar for what was possible in video game technology and storytelling.\n\n\nIf you've never played it before, now's your chance, as it's currently free on Steam. We might take a lot of its elements for granted these days but, take it from an aging gamer, this stuff was revolutionary at the time.\n\nThe post Half-Life reaches its highest ever player peak on its 25th birthday appeared first on Destructoid.",

Krueger also reflects on this and expresses pride in all the accomplishments his team has earned. \n\n\nIlari Kuittinen, who is the General Manager and Co-Founder of Housemarque, also comments on Krueger's departure. He claims Krueger's \"passion and direction have been vital\" for the studio which has endured the death and rebirth of the \"Arcade\". \n\n\nAlthough Krueger doesn't explain what prompted the departure, he states that it was a difficult decision. He is also confident that the studio has a bright future ahead, as it has \"an exciting new project in the works, a fantastic team that’s stronger than ever, and the continuous support of Sony and PlayStation Studios.\"\n\n\nKrueger isn't the only notable industry figure who has stepped down from a long-held position. Pete Hines announced his departure from Bethesda not long after Starfield's launch, and Activision Blizzard's Bobby Kotick is also preparing to leave after 32 years with the gaming giant. \n\nThe post Returnal director Harry Krueger leaving Housemarque after almost 15 years appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the interim, modders have been making do, leading to the creation of an \"immersive survival addon\" for Starfield.\n\n\nThe aptly titled \"Starvival\" comes from a modder known as lKocMoHaBTl, and it successfully introduces a fairly important new gameplay mechanic into Starfield: the so-called Needs. Needs are, essentially, a comprehensive set of counters, buffs, addictions, and other complimentary features that turn Starfield into a game where food is, in fact, necessary.

Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. \nThe Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, \"This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite.\" \n✅ Unforgettable event\npic.twitter.com/xAhMKtmwiG\nNovember 21, 2023\nBefore the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. \nThe Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. \n\"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2,\" Epic writes in a blog post. \"Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET.\"\nWhile waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite. \nAre you hopping into Fortnite's Big Bang event next month?

We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: \nBig news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!\n#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU\nNovember 21, 2023\nAll that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack.

Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. \nEpic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.\nOver the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…",

That update is now out and it includes free cosmetic items, some bug fixes, and balance changes that should make the game easier. \n\n\nPlus, alongside this update, developer Neowiz has officially released the Lies of P soundtrack; it's available for purchase on Steam for $9.99 and hits digital music streaming platforms later today. \nHere's what's new in Update Version 1.3.0.…",

          "description": "Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.\n\nGame Informer: With the acknowledgment that it’s very different individuals and teams involved, on a studio level I’m curious if there are things about the post-launch support for Diablo III that are now being put into us…",

It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. \nMore specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below: \nArcane. Season 2. November 2024. #GeekedWeek pic.twitter.com/SmPjKZKhOx\nNovember 9, 2023\nWith roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven't yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you've got plenty of time to do so – and it's well worth your time!\nIn the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer's review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story.

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however).

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later!
