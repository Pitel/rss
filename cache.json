During each brief transit, raindrops fall from a corrugated overhead roof, dripping randomly, with enough gaps to allow you to make your crossing unscathed.

The result feels rough around the edges but it's hard to deny that the gameplay feels pretty great.\nEnemies hit hard, frequently gang up on you, and will almost assuredly send you back to the hub dozens of times before you manage to successfully complete a run. And while Summum Aeterna primarily demands dexterous skills to overcome its toughest challenges, you do have something to show for each failed run. You, of course, lose most of the upgrades you snagged while out and about, but every run will see you gaining currency and crafting materials that you can then reinvest into things like better stats and starting weapons. This meta-progression system thus ensures that you’ll always be making progress, even when you lose time after time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I could recall the memory quite clearly—sitting against a study pillow on my childhood bed with the controller’s too-short cord pulled taut against the GameCube across the room, furiously speeding through the game in an attempt to finish every goal before Hollywood Video’s three-day rental period elapsed.\nIt’s hard to explain the cognitive dissonance I felt when my advisor started talking about in-game material that was completely unknown to me, that was certainly not what I remembered playing but had an eerie sameness to it, like the game I knew but in an alternate reality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Another Another World.\nFull Void, a narrative platforming puzzle game from London indie studio OutOfTheBit Ltd, wears its love of cinematic platformer classics on its sleeve. Bringing along core gameplay ideas from early entries in the genre, it mixes in some modern influences and introduces a few new ideas of its own.\nYou play as a hoody-up teen on the run, lugging a backpack with a computer in it as you trek through desolate cityscapes in knee-patched jeans. You are hunted by evil robot monsters, tracking you down with their menacing stop-light eyes and scuttling about on spidery legs. As atmospheric as it is, quite why this is happening takes a while to become clear. Nonetheless, the threat of your pursuers feels real and lends significance to the companionship of a small robot helper you encounter later in the game. Flashback cutscenes suggest this robot was developed by your mother before things went bad, bringing a satisfying element of vengeance to the story.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That’s actually a good thing as it means Boundless Trails can implement new mechanics without being beholden to them. This has an engaging real-time action combat system with plenty of great worldbuilding through side quests. However, the story is rather simplistic and sometimes the platforming feels imprecise.

          "description": "One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. \nThe winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the \"Hoarding\" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which \"hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood\". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.\nRead more",

This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. \"What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time,\" the author wrote on his Substack. \"It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.\"\r\n\n\r\nYou might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!\nIt's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.\nRead more",

          "description": "On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was \"fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. \r\n\nAnd yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.\n  \nRead more",

You do the math(s).\nI actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in. \nRead more",

A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.\nTurns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.\nRead more",

It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll. \nRead more",

You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.\r\n\n\r\nGunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.\r\n\n \nRead more",

No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. \nYou play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?\nRead more",

Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.\nBut it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun.

Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet.

          "description": "Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type \"player.setpos x 10\" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type \"setgravityscale 0\" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.\nSpace sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of \"player.setpos\" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. \nAnd after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.\nRead more",

          "description": "The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word \"immersive\". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. \r\n\n\r\nIn theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, \"the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.\nRead more",

          "description": "I never watched the original Gargoyles animated series, but I've been on the internet for long enough to know that it's a cult favourite for being a Disney show with surprisingly dark themes. I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.\r\n\nBoth those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.\nRead more",

In Winter, no less.\nIt's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it \"diverting\" rather than \"entertaining\", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.\nRead more",

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.\nBut the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and… \nRead more",

Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.\nSo, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.\nRead more",

          "description": "Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. \r\n\n\r\nThe game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It's just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you're viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)\r\n\n \nRead more",

It puts a bucket in front of you and asks if you think you can beat it. It's a question that's lingered every minute since.\n\n\nI've been playing through Chrono Trigger for the first time, nigh-unspoiled on what makes this role-playing game such a legend in the genre. (So if you're scrolling down to the comments already, please be chill.) I've already been majorly impressed with how Squaresoft's team signals to the player that their actions, big and small, ripple out through the story.\n\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I've been brought to The End of Time, Chrono Trigger's equivalent of the archetypal RPG campfire, and there's a few anachronisms lingering aroun…",

          "description": "In a Twitter post, General Manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson indicated that Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, has so much new stuff that two deep dive streams are already planned to cover it all. No dates for the streams have been revealed as of now, but it's a promising glimpse into the near future of Diablo 4.\n\n\nSeason 1, Season of the Malignant, has been pretty disappointing, to say the least. Sweeping nerfs hit the action RPG with the seasonal update, making the experience feel slower and less fun than the pre-season. To make things worse, the season itself doesn't have much meaningful new content.\n\n\nIf there's enough new content to justify two separate deep dive streams, it may be a bigger season than expected.\n\n\n@RodFergusson on Twitter\n\n\nWhat we know so far\n\n\nPlayers were shocked to see Season of Blood revealed at Gamescom opening night, just over a month after the first season began. Thematically, the new season will focus on an army of ravenous vampires plaguing Sanctuary. Season 2 will feature a new quest line where you learn to hunt the hunter.\n\n\nGameplay-wise, the new season will add five endgame bosses as well as ways to target farm Uniques and Uber Uniques. Additionally, several quality-of-life enhancements are on the way. Renown rewards will now carry over to all characters, and gems will no longer take up inventory space. A revamp of elemental resistances as well as updates to several stats is also coming.\n\n\nBlizzard plans to support Diablo 4 for a long time, so it's hard to say they need Season 2 to work out. However, after a disappointing first season, a better second season can show players it's heading in the right direction. Most ARPGs that are thriving now like Path of Exile took a few seasons to find their footing.\n\n\nDiablo 4's Season 2, Season of Blood, officially begins on October 17 on all platforms. The current season, Season of the Malignant, will also come to an end on the same day.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Season 2 has two deep-dive streams worth of content appeared first on Destructoid.",

Per the game’s page on Steam, there are multiple endings, a variety of minigames, and an entire city to explore. Admittedly, yeo was sparse on the game’s details, but one sentence has this writer immediately intrigued: \n\n\n“Old tropes are here but you can choose to not follow them. The question is — does anything really matter that much now?”\n\n\n\n\nyeo released The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa on May 17, 2018, and their second game Arrest of a Stone Buddha on February 27, 2020. A manga adaptation of Ringo Ishikawa was published later in 2020, on October 9. Fading Afternoon marks the developer’s return after more than three years.\n\n\nFading Afternoon will normally set you back $19.99, but if you buy before September 21, you can get it for $17.99, which represents a 10% discount.

When we moved a few years ago, my husband and I bought a lot of Ikea furniture, and it’s amazing that we’re still together. However, near the end of it, I was quietly assembling media centers by myself in the other room.\n\n\n\n\nKallaX, for some reason, is attempting to replicate that experience endlessly in a co-op video game format. You play as little space men who must work together to gather parts and assemble furniture to ship out. It’s one part Overcooked and two parts malicious intent. It’s the whole experience: instructions, construction, and violent urges.\n\n\nI usually bring these sorts of games to play with my parents and test their 40-some years of marriage. After all those years, my father has become an expert at annoying my mother, and it has never stopped being funny. Unfortunately, the current release is PC only. It’s a lot harder to gather people around my computer monitor, and while there are options to stream to my TV, I’m not lugging my PC to my parents’ house. Hopefully, a console port will follow, but for now, KallaX will have an online co-op if you feel comfortable playing with people outside the range of a good, motivating charlie horse.\n\n\nKallaX releases for PC on September 18, 2023.\n\nThe post KallaX gives you yet another reason to hate your friends September 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lies of P is a dark fantasy soulslike that retells Pinocchio's story with a grim twist. It's replicating Bloodborne's vibe which not many other big-budget games have tried. The parallels are so blatant between the two that it almost comes as a detriment to the game.\n\n\nWhat Bloodborne doesn't have is a hanging puppet with a sign reading \"APAB\" on it. Lies of P doesn't have one either now, as it was removed from the game before release.\n\n\nThe sign appeared in one image, referencing the saying \"All Cops Are Bastards\" or ACAB. It stands out so much that it caught the eye of videogames.si's Georgina Young, who interviewed Lies of P's director Ji-Won Choi about it.\n\n\nDespite being such a small part of the game, Choi was happy to talk about it. He clarified that the sign stands for \"All Puppets are Bastards\" before jumping into its removal.\n\n\nThe sign's removal came down to not wanting to be \"judged based on following trends,\" according to Choi. Lies of P had several other \"risky factors\" removed to not alienate players. \n\n\nIf left in the final product, it could have echoed something like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's \"mechanical apartheid\" which was seen as being in bad taste. Lies of P differs in that APAB never took a large role its marketing.\n\n\nA part of me wonders if other in-game signs took real-life inspiration since the other signs had no elaboration. Puppets are the game's antagonists, and their depiction could have also taken more real-world inspiration at one point.\n\n\nThis hypothetical version of Lies of P and the sign are not in the final product. At least the game's message still appears to be that all puppets are bastards.\n\nThe post Lies of P studio cut a sign based on ACAB from the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Instead, this particular shindig is a big deal because the demo features one of the game's big new gameplay hooks: a driveable motorcycle. While trailers have shown off this feature, it wasn't necessarily a given that it'd be available for players to check out in the demo. Especially since the game is due to launch soon, on October 26.\n\n\nGhostrunner 2's vehicular combat is already a bit of a point of contention in the community, however. On the game's subreddit, players have highlighted a wealth of bugs in the demo and a bit of indecisiveness as to whether One More Level did the right thing when it decided to include the bike. To that end, this demo may not jive all that well with all the fans of the original Ghostrunner.\n\n\nImage via One More Level\n\n\nWill Ghostrunner 2 pull combat bikes off?\n\n\nThe opinions on Ghostrunner 2's all-new bike are mixed so far, it would seem. While some players enjoy its speed and brutality, others are put off by their lack of control over the machine. If One More Level intended for the bike to be this game's wow feature, it might not pan out on this merit alone.\n\n\nThe good news, though, is that the demo itself shows that Ghostrunner 2 is a true-to-form sequel. Players should expect an ability rebalance and a slightly modified movement system, with a greater focus on having a coherent narrative and, according to the devs, more freedom in creating a character build. All great news for those who just wanted more of Ghostrunner, of course. But the bike itself may end up being a bit of an acquired taste for the community in general.\n\n\nGhostrunner 2 will launch on October 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nThe post Ghostrunner 2 gets new demo, features a motorcycle appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, get ready for an even tougher time in this WW1 setting, as an even tougher difficulty mode is on the way.\n\n\nAccording to Creative Lead Fredrik Olsson (as spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun), the latest Amnesia game is getting a Halloween update, which includes a \"shell shocked mode.\" This new difficulty will see the immersive sim horror game present an even greater challenge for players.\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, the admin office – where safety is pretty much a guarantee – will now have a wooden door instead of its usual metal barricade. This, presumably, means the stalking monster will be able to get to the player, thus assuring nowhere is safe.\n\n\nNope. Can't hide there, either.\n\n\nAt times of great stress, at least you can always count on the menu to pause the action, giving you a moment to rest. Not in the update. According to Olsson, time will not stop when you enter the menu screen.\n\n\nWhat else? Oh yes. The update for Amnesia: The Bunker will also be introducing \"new and randomized locations of corpses, dog tags and bunker rats.\"\n\n\nAnd if just these features weren't enough, it also looks like the pistol – your one and only defense – is going to be stored in a locker. Therefore, you'll have to find a code for the padlock before you can get to it.\n\n\nThere doesn't appear to be an exact date for when this patch is going to start rolling out, so look out for it in the closing days of October.

It was one of the games that popularized dungeon crawlers and helped translate tabletop RPGs to the home computer. It’s not the first, however. Richard Garriot’s Akalabeth predates it by a year and DunjonQuest: Temple of Apshai by two.

Throughout the SNES, PSX, and PS2 eras of gaming, those lower budget, heartfelt RPGs were my bread and butter.

          "description": "In the opening section of Starfield, we're introduced to Vasco, the bulky robot that assists you on your quest to meet up with Constellation. Now, a figurine of the heavy-duty machine will soon be yours to own. But it's going to set you back a bit.\n\n\nAs spotted by GamesRadar, a company called PureArts that specializes in collectibles is launching its own line of Vasco figures. The Starfield companion is available to pre-order now, with a proposed release date of Q3, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe model itself is fully articulated and is a 1/6th representation of its video game counterpart. However, be prepared to fork over quite a bit as it's priced at $369. That does seem quite steep for a figure of a video game character.\n\n\nSome more details\n\n\nImages on the site, as well as the above video, show how much detail has gone into this replica of the Starfield NPC. As well as having 15 points of articulation, this Vasco keepsake has also been licensed by Bethesda, so it's a legit piece of memorabilia.\n\n\nSome additional info:\n\n\n\nPolyresin\n\n\nHighly detailed painted sculpt\n\n\nFully articulated legs, arms, hands, and fingers\n\n\nScuffed paint and dented panels give a genuine in-game feel\n\n\nExclusive Item: \"The Artifact\" on a wood base\n\n\n\nBasically, if you've been digging Starfield lately, and you're a fan of collectibles, this could be right up your alley. It is quite pricey, but its level of detail and the fact that it's been officially licensed may explain the cost. To some extent, at least.\n\nThe post Starfield’s Vasco is coming to you soon as a fully articulated figurine appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just weeks following the launch of Immortals of Aveum, developer Ascendant Studios has laid off approximately 45% of its team, according to a report by Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter and testimony from some of the impacted employees. Ascendant CEO Bret Robbins explained the layoffs in a Twitter post as “a painfully difficult, but necessary decision that was not made lightly.”\n\n\n\n\nIt is unclear at press time what the specific reason for the layoffs is, though the Polygon report says a former Ascendant employee attributed them to Immortals of Aveum’s poor sales. Robbins doesn’t elaborate on that in the public statement, though he does say “we have to make this adjustment now that Immortals of Aveum has shipped.”\n\n\nImmortals of Aveum launched on August 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. The game was published by EA and marketed as an EA Original, but despite that, according to SteamDB, player totals haven’t exceeded 200 the entire month of September. It would seem the game could be a contender for worst selling game under the EA Originals branding, as stated by an anonymous former employee in the Polygon report.\n\n\nRobbins, in his post on Twitter, confirms that Ascendent is “supporting those affected in every way we can, including comprehensive severance packages and job placement assistance,” and goes on to assure the current team, as well as those involved in these layoffs, that the studio will continue to support the development of the Immortals IP “with future updates and offers.” \n\nThe post Immortals of Aveum’s Ascendant Studios reportedly lays off nearly half of its staff appeared first on Destructoid.",

Full contents include the Deluxe Edition of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the Sephiroth statue, and the following DLC:\n\n\n\nMoogle Trio Summoning Materia (DLC)\n\nA summoning materia that can call \"Moogle Trio\" in the game.\n\n\n\n\nMagic Pot Summoning Materia (DLC)\n\nA summoning materia that can call \"Magic Pot\" in the game.\n\n\n\n\nAccessory: Reclaimant Choker (DLC)\n\nA choker with an effect of restoring HP when an enemy is defeated.\n\n\n\n\nArmor: Orchid Bracelet (DLC)\n\nA bracelet that gives courage to traverse an expanding world.\n\n\n\n\nArmor: Midgar Bangle Mk. II (DLC)\n\nA bracelet worn by travelers leaving Midgar.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs much as I want this, I don't think I can justify it. The statue looks decent quality, but certainly not price-of-a-console quality. But, for those who collect this stuff, I'm sure this is just what they were looking for. Still, it does feel like the price on these Collector's Editions continues to rise while the contents shift to mostly digital stuff.\n\n\nFor me it's all about the steelbook, which it appears actually comes with the Deluxe Edition which is priced at $99.99. That seems a bit more reasonable to me.\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Rebirth releases exclusively on PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth collector’s edition has a cool Sephiroth statue, but it ain’t cheap appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Two years after launch, Tales of Arise is getting another slice of story. Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn looks to add more onto the tale of Dahna and Rena on November 9, 2023.\n\n\nShown during today's State of Play, the trailer shows the whole gang reuniting, one year after the events of the main game's story. Alphen looks to be taking care of a child that's on the run due to her lineage, and the crew gets wrapped up in the drama around it.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the return of some familiar faces and locales in the trailer, as well as some new sights to see. In a press release, Bandai Namco says to expect over 20 hours of new game content with new quests, dungeons, boss fights, and a new story arc.\n\n\nIt sounds like there will also be a bit of a new start in this expansion. In a PlayStation Blog, producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that although Beyond the Dawn is a sequel to the main story, the team wanted all users to be ale to enjoy the game at \"the appropriate level of design.\"\n\n\n\n\"In order to ensure this, a certain level of skills and other statuses are provided at the start, and we did not adopt a simple transfer of levels and statuses from the main game. Instead, we have prepared bonuses such as money and skill points based on the clear data of the main game, so we hope that you will enjoy the new story while taking advantage of these bonuses and developing the characters to your own liking.\"\n- Yusuke Tomizawa, General Producer, Bandai Namco\n\n\n\nArise once more\n\n\nHonestly, I really didn't see this one coming. I really liked Tales of Arise, and it seemed to get some newcomers into the Tales series in general too. Even though the original game wrapped up pretty neatly, I won't say no to more time with this team.\n\n\nTales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn is set to arrive on November 9 for PlayStation\n\nThe post Tales of Arise gets a new adventure with Beyond the Dawn in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Put down that controller. Dr. Tom Tilley has shown us the way to play Puzzle Bobble (also known for years as Bust-A-Move in the West) as the Gods of Finger Dexterity intended: by using a salad spinner.\n\n\nIf you’re like me, you don’t put dirty plants in your mouth, so you might not know what a salad spinner is. My research suggests that it’s a device used to remove water from leafy vegetables after you wash them. It uses centrifugal force to separate the water and dry the leaves. This means that when you drown the salad in ranch dressing, the creamy sauce will stick to it.\n\n\n\n\nTo turn this device of vegetal torture into a controller, Dr. Tilley used some cardboard, an optical mouse, and an external button. Then, when the crank is turned, the mouse movement is read on the game. I’m not sure if this is a PC port of Puzzle Bobble I’m not aware of, or if he’s edited the input. That seems like it would be the hardest part of the process for me.\n\n\nThis isn’t the first Puzzle Bobble controller that Dr. Tilley has MacGyver’d together. Previously, he has created a similar contraption using a coffee grinder. He also got a little more constructive with some tubing. On top of this, he made a Katamari Damacy controller with an actual ball. It’s pretty creative stuff. Meanwhile, I can rarely be bothered to set up my racing wheel.\n\nThe post A salad spinner is definitely the best controller for Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It’s almost time for Spider-Man 2, and it’s in that sentiment that Insomniac Games has revealed a brand new look at the game in today’s PlayStation State of Play. In this first look at how the sequel aims to evolve the open world concept, senior director Bryan Intihar showed off the game’s world, which has effectively doubled in size when you consider the inclusion of both Brooklyn and Queens. \n\n\n\n\nPlayers can now take advantage of the web-wings, which, when paired with traditional web-slinging, can completely change how they explore the game world. There will be more varied locales to check out with these new transportation mechanics, including Midtown High and Miles Morales’ very own Brooklyn Visions Academy. As players traverse New York fighting baddies left and right, they will be able to switch between Peter Parker and Miles Morales at will, and because of the PlayStation 5’s advanced hardware, the transition time is nearly nonexistent, according to Intihar.\n\n\nTied to the increased size of the overworld is the new district rewards system which will unlock a variety of rewards, including fast travel points, on the off chance players don’t feel like manually traveling. One feature that makes a return from past installments is the ability to customize appearance. According to Intihar, Spider-Man 2 will feature more than 65 different suits to pick from.\n\nThe post Latest Spider-Man 2 trailer looks at its open world features appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Foamstars test run launches with two game modes, Smash the Star and Happy Bath Survival.\n\n\nAs for dates, Square Enix included a Foamstars open beta schedule adjusted based on timezone.\n\n\n\nSeptember 29, 6pm - October 1, 11:59pm PDT\n\n\nSeptember 30, 2am - October 2, 7:59am BST\n\n\nSeptember 30, 3am - October 2, 8:59am CET\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Smash the Star, you'll compete in a team deathmatch mode where the rules change as challengers are knocked out. Happy Bath Survival — what a name —whittles teams away into a last-team-standing affair.\n\n\nIf you choose to go all in earlier, your progress in the Foamstars open beta won't carry over to the game's full release. It's also only available for folks on PlayStation 5, though the multiplayer shooter will launch for the PS4, also. \n\n\nToday's State of Play ushered in a handful of new announcements, like a demo for Ghostrunner 2 out today and a look at Sony's new PlayStation controller offerings. However, Square Enix still stole the show with its update on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, showing off brand-new footage and a fancy collector's edition featuring the series' best-conditioned baddie, Sephiroth. \n\nThe post Foamstars hosting Open Beta Party later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.\n\"Emotional weight.\"\nOur interview is done on a video call with each composer …",

Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.\n\n\nMore immediately, we finally got confirmation that \"Separate Ways\" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.\nMoreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.\nFor more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified \"Separate Ways\" as \"Assignment Ada.\" We regret the error.",

The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. \nTwo days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players' ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. \nUnity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company's Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.\n [Source: Bloomberg]",

On top of that, the company revealed that all versions will receive a closed beta test next month, complete with crossplay.\nIn Battle Crush, players choose a character and fight to be the strongest of a pool of 30 players as the ground collapses around them. Due to ever-encroaching waves of enemies and unique battle arenas, players must be thoughtful with their placement and strategies. The player characters, called Calixers, cover a wide range of influences, often drawing inspiration from mythological figures. Battle royale may be the main mode, but Battle Crush also offers Brawl mode, where a player chooses three Calixers to fight with on a smaller map, and Build-Up, a one-on-one mode where two players compete for a best-of-five series.\nPlayers can sign up for Battle Crush's closed beta test, which is slated to run from October 23 through October 30 on Switch, PC, and Android.

Anticipation reached a point that no reasonable game could meet. Cyberpunk could have potentially grappled with those lofty expectations, but the major problem was its technical proficiency – or lack thereof. Despite the game getting good reviews (a product of press only being given PC copies) for most players, the game crashed frequently or was riddled with bugs. The PlayStation 4 version was pulled from shelves and taken offline. The content of the game – the story, the characters, the mechanics – was barely discussed in the face of players struggling even to explore the neon-soaked streets of Night City.

You might have to squat down and flap your arms, like a chicken, to push an egg out of your virtual WarioWare: Move It avatar, for example. In these microgames, you'll need to perform the correct action while in the right form as quick as you can. And you'll need to do so quickly because Nintendo says microgames come one after another in quick succession. \nCheck these WarioWare: Move It microgames out for yourself in the trailer below: \n\n\nEslewhere in today's trailer, we learned more about WarioWare: Move It's Party Mode, which will allow up to four players to compete against each other. You might have to reach a goal without getting caught by Medusa's gaze, for example, or settle a score in an arena to be the last one posing. \nBetween Party Mode and the single-player modes of WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo says there are over 200 microgames to play through. \nWarioWare: Move It hits Switch November 3. \nAre you excited for WarioWare: Move It?

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That's the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. \nDetective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it's likely we'll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There's plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we're hoping to learn more about the company's 2024 plans. Considering \"this winter\" dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.\nOn that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we'll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. \nThis Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. \nWhat do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Apple held a special keynote event today to reveal the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, new Apple Watches, and more. While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company's annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. \n\nWhile details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today's event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It's unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it's already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it's not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. \nAs for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin's Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.\nResident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin's Creed Mirage is Game Informer's current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5. \nRead Game Informer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review here, and then check out our thoughts on Resident Evil Village.

Aptly, this new controller is titled \"Astral Purple.\" It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. \nXbox says, \"This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection,\" noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. \nLike most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 \"Core\" Edition controller.

Premium and Kollector Editions of the game go live this Thursday, September 14, and the regular edition goes live next week on September 19. Ahead of the game's release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. \nToday's trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao's second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nShang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as \"a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona.\" Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster's other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. \nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game. The rest of the editions go live on September 19. \nWhile waiting for the game's release, watch Ed Boon talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on hot wing-eating interview show Hot Ones, and then watch this Nitara gameplay trailer.

This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions.
