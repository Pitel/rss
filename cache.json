We've been having such a good time with the latest expansion that we'd be perfectly happy to see waves of DLC added to this one for years to come, but naturally, Poncle may one day want to move on to a new project. And yet, whatever comes next, it seems we shouldn't expect it to blow the current project's scope out of the water.\nThat is according to the game's creator, Luca Galante, who, in a recent interview with Metro, stated that he wouldn't want a follow-up game to \"try and do something bigger just because it’s what everyone is expecting\". Instead, Galante claims, he'd rather keep working at his own level: \"It would have a higher budget,\" he told Metro, \"but it wouldn’t be dramatically different in terms of scope, than Vampire Survivors\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In the Zone.\nLauded on its original 2007 release, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow Of Chornobyl dropped players into a stark world, filled with effective horror and precision combat. It spawned two sequels, both of which refined and improved on the model of their predecessor. Ukraine-based GSC Game World’s Legends Of The Zone bundle squeezes all three expansive adventures onto Switch with modern optimisations and stable visual performance, although each title is also available as a standalone purchase. It’s worth noting that this is the series' first time on consoles (with the PlayStation versions released back in March), which makes the competency of these ports all the more impressive.\nTaking inspiration from the 1971 Russian novel Roadside Picnic, Shadows Of Chornobyl is set in the irradiated wilderness of the Zone. Decades after repopulation efforts, a second Chornobyl disaster occurs, turning residents into mutated creatures and littering the countryside with deadly elemental anomalies. The haunting and oppressive atmosphere of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film adaptation Stalker, is prevalent throughout. The Zone always feels like an alien landscape, or a bad dream.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.\nYou’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.\nRead more",

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "It’s tempting to frame Straftat as a throwback to an older, better time for the multiplayer FPS, when the lingo was coded in frags and gibs and sucking it down, when satisfaction was drawn entirely from performance rather than some convoluted, artificial system of progression. Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.\nRead more",

          "description": "The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.\nRead more",

          "description": "When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter launched into early access in September it was somewhat messy. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.\nIt's not as bad as it sounds.\nRead more",

And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, \"Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!\"\nNo, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.\nRead more",

As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality.

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.\n Read more",

It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

          "description": "The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy can be thin, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. \"Nazis - I hate these guys!\" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: \"Nazis? I hate these guys!\" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.\nI guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.\n Read more",

          "description": "In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "Real ones know that the only XCOM spin off worth its salt is Hasbro’s 1999 play-by-mail banger First Alien Invasion, although that didn’t stop System Shock 2 studio Irrational from getting to work on an FPS set in the strategy series’ universe after being acquired by 2K in 2006. If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project. Kaiju ambitious.\nRead more",

This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.\nMuch like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.\nRead more",

It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse.

          "description": "Baví vás elektronika, informační technologie, bastlení nebo obecně technika? Pak i tento měsíc je tady pro Vás Virtuální Bastlírna - online setkání hospodského typu všech nadšenců do techniky, organizované projektem MacGyver strahovského studentského klubu SiliconHill.\r\n\r\nPokud by se diskuze náhodou zadrhla, mají Strahováci nachystaná i výplňová témata. Například co se stalo za katastrofy poslední měsíc? Voyager 1 musel kvůli poruše přejít z rychlé komunikace na pásmu X na pomalejší pásmo S. A na neocenitelný WebArchive šlo několik kybernetických útoků, které způsobily nejen výpadek ukládání nových stránek, ale i jeho kompletní nedostupnost.\r\n\r\nAle dost o katastrofách - co za nové projekty se vynořilo? Objevil se nový projekt kompletně 3D tištěného počítače Ondra. Také se našel šikula, který byl schopný rozebrat komunikaci s levnou čínskou termokamerou a získat tak mnohem lepší obrázky. A firma Mosaic uveřejnila patnáctiterapixelový soubor 3D scanů a 360 stupňových obrázků Prahy.\r\n\r\nZ kuriozit se pak nabízí modifikace chytrých baterií firmy Parkside pro kompatibilitu se sítí FindMyIphone, Linux nabootovaný na procesoru Intel 4004 (s malým trikem) a nebo výroba největšího digitronu na světě (v České republice)! \r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

It all concerned the likeness of our favorite motorcyclist, EVA, a key character who somehow never got a voice actor reveal. \n\n\nAs we approach the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta, the time has finally come for us to put this mystery to bed. The MGS Legacy Part 3 unveils that Jodi Benson, the notable voice actor behind Ariel in The Little Mermaid, is, in fact, the voice of EVA. As someone who's been an EVA stan since the early days of MGS3, I'm both surprised and delighted, especially as a fan who grew up on The Little Mermaid films.\n\n\n\n\nBut now, you might be wondering: Why did it take almost two decades for this to be revealed?

          "description": "The main story quest in Brighter Shores will introduce you to the MMORPG's mechanics and professions while also taking you through all four of the game's zones. Starting in Hopeport, you'll join the Guard and eventually be attacked by enemies and forced to defend. One of your fellow guards, Delana, loses her Bow and asks you to find it for her. Here is where to find Delana's Bow for the Main Story quest in Brighter Shores.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere you can find Delana's Bow\n\n\nYou can find Delana's Bow by heading into the Guard Barracks building located directly behind Delana, and then looking behind the light blue Bed on the north end of the Barracks. You'll see the Bow sticking up behind the bed which you can interact with to pick it up for Delana. Head back outside and talk to Delana and tell her you have found her bow, then hand it over to her.\n\n\nHanding over Delana's Bow to her will complete this part of the Main Story quest and allow to continue forward with it. You'll then have to line up with your other fellow Guards before going out and defending the Town Square from the attacking enemies.\n\n\nA good tip when doing quests like this where you need to find certain items that may be hidden or harder to see, is to use your Sense ability by clicking the Eye icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. When you use Sense, your character sends out a pulse that will highlight everything on the map you are currently on that can be used, interacted with, or picked up. This is a great way to find hard to see items and also to see which interactable spots are located on the map for you to use your various professions on.\n\nThe post Where to find Delana’s Bow for Main Story quest in Brighter Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As you start to level up your character in Brighter Shores, Knowledge Points will have immense value to help you improve your character.\n\n\nIn Brighter Shores, there are plenty of professions, and they don't work like the typical class system in MMO. You don't get to pick one of them. Instead, all of them will be available at the same time, and you'll have to level them all up together. This is where the Knowledge Point system comes in, and it can help you level up things far more quickly.\n\n\nHow to get Knowledge Points in Brighter Shores\n\n\nThe process of getting a Knowledge Point is directly related to the level of your profession. Whenever you gain XP by taking part in an activity, you'll contribute to achieving a Knowledge Point. The progress can be seen from the Professions tab, which will show your current progress and the exact rewards that you'll receive.\n\n\nEvery form of activity that you undertake will help you increase your progress in gaining a Knowledge Point. It's unclear as of writing (since I have gained just one so far) if you can stack Knowledge Points or if you'll have to spend them immediately. If it's the latter, there are three ways to spend these valuable points in Brighter Shores.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use Knowledge Points in Brighter Shores\n\n\nKnowledge Points can be used in three different ways.\n\n\n\nUnlock Passive Activity\n\n\nIncrease XP of a specific profession\n\n\nSell for money\n\n\n\nThe recommended use is to unlock Passive Activity, which allows you to gain passive XP for a profession of your choice. You can also use a Knowledge Point to increase the Passive Activity level of a specific profession, which will unlock better rewards.\n\n\nIf you no longer have any Passive Activity to unlock, the Knowledge Points can be used to increase the XP for a profession to get new rewards as well. Make sure not to spend your points on getting money, as that's the least advisable way to spend this resource.\n\nThe post Brighter Shores: How do Knowledge Points work appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you've started the quest and are seemingly unable to continue the story due to a sudden soft lock, I've got the solution that will fix your problem, though it is a bit unusual.\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero 1.3 Special Agent Story Soft Lock Workaround (Fix)\n\n\nIf you're playing Zenless Zone Zero on the PC client, you might encounter a point in the new Special Agent story where progress halts, leaving you stuck in Immersive Storytelling mode with no way to advance. You are also unable to move, thus softlocking you and preventing you from really doing anything else in the game. Normally, you'd have to wait for the developers to fix this sort of problem in this scenario. Although a fix is likely coming soon, there's a workaround you can use now to keep playing the rest of the update content.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nTo be clear, this problem only exists on the PC client, so if you're stuck, the solution is to load up Zenless Zone Zero through its mobile client. You can do this on any mobile device, though it may take a little time to download if it's not already installed. Once installed, open the game and attempt to continue the storyline on the device. Doing this should resolve the soft lock for you, allowing you to continue playing and progressing on the PC client. \n\n\nIf this solution does not work for you, then I'm afraid you will have to wait for the developers to fix the problem and release a fix. Fortunately, HoYoverse, the developers behind Zenless Zone Zero, are quick to fix such disruptive problems and will also likely reward pull currency as compensation for your troubles.\n\nThe post How to Fix the Zenless Zone Zero 1.3 Story Soft Lock Issue appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, technically it's version 1.6.9 to account for the latest patch, but it comes with everything that came before it and that PC fans have been enjoying for months now.\n\n\nHowever, there appears to be a small issue when it comes to performance. According to a recent post on X from developer Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone, there is a solution to those playing the latest version of Stardew Valley.\n\n\n\n\nUntil a more permanent fix can be sent out, Barone suggests anyone experiencing performance problems should \"remove all hats from pets.\" No, this is apparently not a joke. Our own Paula kindly confirmed this to be a genuine piece of advice to the issue.\n\n\nFor real\n\n\nIf you're new to Stardew Valley and not sure what the advice entails, you're advised to \"try putting a different hat on your pet,\" which will then \"remove the original hat first.\" When pressed for further details in an excuse me, what? kind of way, the developer had this to say:\n\n\n\nThere's rumors of a strange rash affecting pets' ears in Zuzu City and we just want to make sure those ears can breath [sic] for a few days.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1.6.9 update went live a couple of days ago, bringing with it new features and changes. According to the patch notes, the game now gives you the ability to \"place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture,\" adds in new Easter eggs, balances some aspects, and...you know what, there's too much to list here. Best to read the changelog itself.\n\n\nThe mobile port of Stardew Valley also now comes loaded with a hidden and experimental multiplayer feature. Instructions on how you can access it can be found here.\n\nThe post Having performance issues on Stardew Valley? Remove hats from pets, dev says appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Forager is one of the several professions available in Brighter Shores, and unlocking it is relatively easy.\n\n\nIn fact, the unlock condition is directly part of the main quest, and hence, you can't miss it by any chance. If you're strictly sticking with the main quest, this will be the second profession you'll unlock. The process begins after you've enlisted as a guard and cleared the tutorial, so read to know what you exactly need to do.\n\n\nHow to become a Forager in Brighter Shores\n\n\nBecoming a Forager is easy - just pick a resource from off the ground. When you're starting out, this is tricky. Most of the decisions you make are strictly based on the main quest.\n\n\n\nClear out the first couple of goblins.\n\n\nHelp out the civilian to carry his goods safely.\n\n\nReturn to your captain, and you'll find that one of your fellow guards is gravely injured.\n\n\nGo to the Apocethary, and you'll be tasked with finding Brown Kelp.\n\n\nThis item will require you to travel all the way to the docks.\n\n\nYou'll pass through four different regions, but you can't get lost because all paths that aren't required will be locked.\n\n\nGo to the coast and pick up some of the Kelp lying around. You'll find three ores to pick up and get all of them.\n\n\nPicking the first one will automatically unlock the Forager profession for you in Brighter Shores.\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nYou can also unlock the Fisherman profession along the way. This can be done from the Eel Bridge location, and you'll have to travel over the spot to complete the quest. If you're still confused as to how to do it, make sure to check this guide out.\n\n\nIf you've already unlocked the Fisherman profession, this guide will help you out with the correct locations where you will be able to find the fish to catch. Once you've unlocked a profession, make sure to complete tasks that will help you level up your profession and gain Knowledge Points along the way.\n\nThe post How to unlock the Forager profession in Brighter Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Brighter Shores is available worldwide, and you can enjoy different professions inside the game.\n\n\nProfessions act differently in this title, as you can't pick them during character creation. In fact, you'll always start as a Guard as part of the tutorial. But the game ensures that you're not forced to grind a single profession aimlessly, and being a fisherman inside the game can be pretty fun. But first, you must unlock it, and doing so will require you to emphasize your investigative skills.\n\n\nHow to become a Fisherman in Brighter Shores\n\n\nFisherman is the second profession you get to unlock in Brighter Shores. Naturally, it can be unlocked pretty early, but this profession isn't a part of the main quest. Hence, it's pretty easy to miss as you run around the map finding vital resources.\n\n\n\nComplete the tutorial for the goblin attack to take place.\n\n\nFend off the initial batch of goblins and help out a civilian to ferry his goods to a cart in the Town Square.\n\n\nOnce you return, you'll find that one of your allies has been gravely wounded in the battle.\n\n\nYou'll have to head out to find Brown Kelp to save their life.\n\n\nGo north from the Town Square, and you'll come across the Eel Street Bridge. You'll have to cross the bridge, and two goblins will be waiting for you.\n\n\nOnce you defeat the goblins, look down below the bridge.\n\n\nA fish will be highlighted in bright blue.\n\n\nClick on it, and you'll unlock the Fisherman profession.\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nBecoming a Fisherman in Brighter Shores will allow you to fish in suitable spots. However, you can't do that immediately, as you won't have the necessary equipment. To catch fish, you'll need a fishing rod. Make sure to check out our fishing guide if you want to become an expert angler and catch fish whenever you want.\n\nThe post How to unlock the Fisherman profession in Brighter Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

Halo: Combat Evolved looked fantastic when it came out, but Halo 2 looked almost next-gen in comparison. \n\n\nSadly, though it was indeed a gameplay presentation — not the usual CGI cutscene most studios nowadays use for game reveals — the release version featured only a severely toned down version of the original Mombasa mission. The devs explain the mission was only created for the presentation and wasn't originally intended to be part of the game. The mission ended up going nowhere as its sour…",

This is due to several reasons, but one of the biggest ones is composer David Wise's beautiful soundtrack.\n\n\nScreenshot via Nintendo of America/YouTube\n\n\nFortunately, longtime fans of the series can now finally listen to this groundbreaking score in an official manner. Some people on social media websites like Reddit or Twitter/X quickly noticed that Nintendo just added the entire Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest to its new music app, Nintendo Music.

So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about which cards will be part of the promo. However, several rumors have become available online, indicating the items that will be present in the promo.\n\n\nComplete list of EA FC 25 Centurions promo players (leaks)\n\n\nSo far, the leaks have revolved around the icons. These are unique cards of former legends, and Centurions will introduce a new version. Here's the list of available icons that are rumored to appear as part of the upcoming promo.\n\n\n\nHernan Crespo\n\n\nGianluca Zambrotta\n\n\nJuan Sebastian Veron\n\n\nPavel Nedved\n\n\nDavid Beckham\n\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger\n\n\nRuud Van Nistelrooy\n\n\nEdwin Van der Sar\n\n\nSol Campbell\n\n\nMichael Laudrup\n\n\nFoudy\n\n\nFranck Ribery\n\n\n\nThe list of the icons looks pretty stacked, but we have no idea about their overall ratings or playstyles. That could be a big difference maker, and it's more than likely that EA Sports could add separate playstyles on the Centurions version.\n\n\nSo far, we have rumors of another special card for the recent Ballon d'Or winner, Rodri. Interestingly, the Centurions promo could feature several Ballon d'Or nominees, so that team of cards could be amazing as well. The list consists of the world's most prominent footballers, so it will be interesting to find out who makes it to the promo.\n\n\nThe Centurions promo could be a two-team affair as well, although that remains to be seen for the time-being. Additionally, it will be fun to have a couple of Centurions Icons as SBCs. We are yet to get a single Icon SBC this year in Ultimate Team, so breaking the duck will be a nice moment for the community. \n\nThe post All EA FC 25 Centurions promo player leaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
