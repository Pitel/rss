And, after it snuck in at fourth in last month's European charts despite only being out for a few days, it's perhaps unsurprising that the family and online-oriented sports game is the number one selling game for the month of May across Europe.\nThat's mightily impressive given that Nintendo doesn't share digital sales and that this is based only on the physical. However, it's not exactly had stiff competition in what has been a quiet month. No new game releases have charted in the European top 20.

Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.\nIt’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos' fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.\nRead more",

The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it's actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). \nDiablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it's all right to play! However, I don't know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it's a bad decision and we've already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.\nRead more",

Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It's an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.\n\"About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it,\" says producer Swann Martin-Raget. \"We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we've adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us.\"\nRead more",

After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.\nIt turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.\nRead more",

Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. \nWhat I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.\nRead more",

So, it came as no surprise when I found myself testing out the closed alpha of yet another of their ilk: Ripout, an upcoming sci-fi horror FPS that's very Doom 3.\nWhat's nice is that vidbud Liam joined me! Both because he's a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn't happen and we had a pretty swell time, I'd say.

          "description": "Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.\r\n\nThat's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.\nRead more",

It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.\nYet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.\nRead more",

          "description": "Here we have another AOC gaming monitor, except it’s not just by AOC, but by posh car makers Porsche? It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?\r\n\n \nRead more",

A trailer debuted at Summer Game Fest 2022 with familiar characters and scenes from the wider series, albeit looking better than ever.\nhttps://youtu.be/AwEXJ3T1EJM\nIt really feels like history is repeating itself, both in terms of the tortured artist storyline and the gameplay of Layers of Fear 1 and 2 (and Inheritance, the game with the painter's daughter, which is easily forgotten about and will likely end up feeling the freshest here). We've seen tons of remasters and even full-on remakes in recent years, but this is blurring the lines in a way that I wasn't expecting after Bloober Team's recent teases.\n\"Layers of Fears will be the complete, definitive, and at the same time unpredictable way to discover the stories of artists enslaved by their obsessions,\" according to Bloober Team. \"Prepare for an exquisite horror experience thanks to the expanded plot lines that will cast a new light on the overarching narrative.\" You can see some screenshots on Steam.\n\nThe developers say they're \"focused on tense exploration and immersive storytelling,\" though that's going to be a hard sell for some people based on the series so far.\nI personally have had my fun with Layers of Fear (and to a lesser extent its direct sequel), so I'm curious if Layers of Fears will end up feeling fresh enough, conceptually, to justify itself. The visual fidelity is clearly a step up from the original games, but that can only take me so far. In general, this spooky (?) series has a lot of fans — and a lot of haters.\nLayers of Fears is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store.\nThe post Layers of Fears captures the whole series in one new horror trip appeared first on Destructoid.",

Also, the Summer Game Fest trailer reveal had another tidbit of info: the game is coming to consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X) and \"will be playable from day one on Xbox Game Pass.\"\nThe Humankind - Heritage Edition on Console will include:\nDigital Game\nCultures of Latin America Pack\nCultures of Africa Pack\nNotre-Dame Pack\nAs long as it turns out OK, that's probably where I'll jump back in.

Deep Silver and Volition have launched a Saints Row character creator dubbed the \"Boss Factory,\" and it's out now for free on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.\nThe Boss Factory will let you craft all kinds of looks for your avatar, the Boss, and I really mean all kinds. Today's trailer showed everything from giant body-builder types to wild costumes, and even a Nosferatu-looking Boss. Finally, I can live out my crime-vampire dreams.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHHgTmdjyl0\nBig Boss energy\nSaints Row has always been known for its more out-there vibes. But it's also nice to see some options that really open up character creation, whether that's making someone that feels more representative of you in the world, or just becoming the nocturnal ghoul you've always hoped to be. The creator advertises thousands of options, from teeth and make-up to muscles, tattoos, and skin tints. Heck, even the veins are customizable in the Saints Row Boss Factory. It's a slider I never even thought to consider.\nThis character creator will let you get everything set, so your perfect Boss is ready by Aug. 23 when Saints Row launches on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. And in the meantime, you can live out your wildest Nightmare Factory dreams.

Today, DotEmu locked in a launch date of June 16 for TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, and Casey Jones is joining the fray.\nToday's trailer at the Summer Game Fest showcase debuted Casey in all his hockey-masked glory. Casey will fight alongside the turtles, their master Splinter, and beat-em-up reporter April O'Neil.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyfKYsSDDb4\nAlso confirmed is local and online co-op for up to six players. Yes, that means a lot of chaos on the screen all at once. But isn't that a plus?\nSix-player mayhem\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge impressed me a lot when I played it at PAX East earlier this year, and adding both more players and Casey Jones is just icing on top. Dotemu's garnered a good reputation for brawlers at this point, with its previous work on projects like Streets of Rage 4.\nWith TMNT: Shredder's Revenge though, it really feels like they're honing in on that Saturday morning brawler feeling. In my demo, it felt fairly easy to pick up and play as anyone, and the fighters all felt very individual. After seeing April bash someone with a boom mic, I'm pretty thrilled to see what the team has concocted for Casey Jones. Add in a ton of multiplayer mayhem, and June's looking like a good time for a couch co-op party.\nThe brawling gets underway next week when TMNT: Shredder's Revenge hits PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch on June 16.\nThe post TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge hits June 16, with Casey Jones in the lineup appeared first on Destructoid.",

This speedy FPS is the new game from Donut County developer Ben Esposito and the crew at Angel Matrix. Rather than a cozy game about swallowing the world up, Neon White is about speed, execution, and anime. Just big anime vibes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL8C6v7_vi8\nSpeeding through the afterlife\nThe crux of Neon White is that you're a former assassin who's died and gone to... well, not heaven. As Neon White (the character), you're saved from Hell to compete with other Neons in a competition for a shot at redemption.\nMost of the levels take place in a dreamy paradise, with clouds and vistas abound. Oh, and demons. You want to get from point A to B as fast as possible, while also wiping out any demons you can. It feels fast and fluid, like if the Pilot's Gauntlet from Titanfall 2 was spread out into a full game. Plus, it has a side of getting to know your fellow Neons.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayNeonWhite/status/1526983810289745925\nThe demo for it really spoke to me earlier this year, with its mix of precision FPS running and social sim side-ventures.

Best of all, there's four-player co-op, locally and online. As intentionally dumb as Goat Simulator can be, that part actually interests me! Wacky free-roaming shenanigans can be a lot of fun with a partner.\nIn Goat Simulator 3, players will \"cause all manner of mayhem as you lick, headbutt, crash and explode your way across the map, leaving no NPC unannoyed.\"\nThe humor and slapdash physics may not feel particularly modern at this point — I sympathize with anyone who thinks this \"simulation\" has run its course — but there's a world in which I could have some fun playing Goat Simulator 3, I think. Maybe!\nI'm less interested in mini-games (there's going to be seven types) and more on board with the idea of exploring for secrets together. I'm sure they'll get pretty out-there with unlockable skins and \"gear parts\" if there are (*checks notes*) oh wow, 300 of 'em.\nSometimes, you need a shut-off-your-brain game with low stakes and the ability to make quick, tangible progress to keep you entertained.

Yep, that's kind of the concept for a lot of these far-future sci-fi games, but this one in particular looks super interesting, especially in terms of how you interact with the narrative.\nWe heard from the project roughly a month ago, but now we have a little more than the 30 second teaser to go off of: a two minute trailer! You play as Trevor Hills, who is stuck in a sort of Truman Show-like situation, and wants to uh, leave. The Summer Game Fest trailer today gives us a better look at how this world operates, and how unhinged the [what seems to be the] producer of the \"show\" can get when something goes awry.\nEric has a great in-depth look at it here, just in case you haven't checked out the premise yet! American Arcadia is set for \"PC and console\" at some point. Everything from the aesthetics (the bright retro vibe juxtaposed to some of the seedier underbelly portions of the world) to the whole vibe has me keeping an eye on this one.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBgA7zRbhKY\nThe post American Arcadia has an interesting dystopian TV setup appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Strategy lives on\nReal-time strategy fans got something new to look forward to today. Stormgate is a new free-to-play RTS from Frost Giant Studios, with a beta coming in 2023.\nDuring today's Summer Game Fest stream, a cinematic introduced the world of Stormgate. The two factions shown so far seem demonic on one side, and futuristic human resistance on the other. A little of Terrans vs. the Forces of Hell, so to speak.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLMEIMCmS44\nDuring the stream, a developer from Frost Giant confirmed that Stormgate will be free-to-play, but they're conscious of concerns. That means no pay-to-win and no NFTs. There's campaign co-op, as well as versus multiplayer for three-on-three or traditional one-on-one.\nNew giants\nFrost Giant is a new studio of former Blizzard developers, so this one has some pedigree behind it. According to the Steam page, it seems to be going for all the trappings of classic Warcraft and StarCraft. Big story missions showing the war between Earth's defenders and invading demonic Infernals, a competitive ladder with tournament options, and a free-to-play model that avoids pay-to-win. A big draw to my eye is the custom map editor. Those user-made maps made up a hefty bulk of my time in old Blizzard RTS games, and I'm hopeful to see some wild tower defenses and such on there.\nWe'll see what they have in store in 2023, when Stormgate is planned to head into open beta. Popularity for the beta is pretty high, as shown by the Frost Giant site has been dipping in and out as I'm writing this. But once the site is back up, you'll be able to sign up for the beta at this link. Until then, you can still wishlist on Steam and gawk at some screenshots.\nThe post Stormgate is a new F2P RTS from former Blizzard developers appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game will be scored by the legendary musician Mick Gordon, of Doom and Killer Instinct fame.\nThe trailer begins with a montage of strange and abstract imagery before we cut to an unseen explorer picking their way through what appears to be a dilapidated subway system. It is a short-lived journey, however, as they soon find themselves in the hands of the futuristic, frightening bots. I'm not sure if that weird, box-shaped gun is going to get the job done against this Metal Mickey.

We got our first mood-setting trailer at the Summer Game Fest 2022 stream and some follow-up info from Troy Baker and Roger Clark, who play a medical officer and maintenance engineer, respectively.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mg6sgSorQk\nBaker described the original pitch from developer Fallen Leaf as being a \"tight thriller\" that feels like \"Dead Space meets Duncan Jones' Moon.\" That's not exactly what we've seen so far today — admittedly, we've seen almost nothing! — but if Fort Solis can come anywhere close to achieving that kind of fusion, in gameplay and story, I'm down.\nHost Geoff Keighley probed the voice actors about how the game actually plays, to which Baker said players will explore, discover, and move very fast through the world with different means of traversal. Baker added that the \"narrative is a huge element\" — which makes sense given who's involved — and, well, that was it. These events move fast. A bit of intrigue, but maybe not enough to set the game apart from other recent sci-fi romps.\n\nAccording to Fallen Leaf, the game spans \"one large base location encompassing over nine individual structures,\" and you can play above ground or \"simply progress by remaining below the surface,\" which is intriguing. Certain big story moments are said to have \"multiple outcomes.\" When everything is said and done, we'll learn what happened to the missing crew and why Fort Solis was created in the first place — ominous!\nFort Solis is coming to Steam, but a release window wasn't announced today.\nWhy can't things ever go right on Mars?

It's been in the hopper for years now but the The Astronauts-developed FPS is now finally coming out in early access form later this year. The Summer Game Fest trailer today re-confirmed it!\nWitchfire evokes a Hexen-like feel with a very old school FPS vibe, framed around a \"dark fantasy\" world. The studio notes that the game will be heavily action-oriented with \"no cutscenes,\" and given how thirsty folks are for classic FPS games with a modern sheen, I can say with certainty that it has a baked-in audience.\nThe Early Access version is coming to PC later in 2022 (Q4 is targeted) on the Epic Games Store, with a wishlist option. It's hard to believe that after all this time The Astronauts only has The Vanishing of Ethan Carter under its belt: but it's actually a very small studio, and I can't wait to see what they came up with.\nThe studio has a full rundown of the game on their site, with an FAQ of sorts. The Early Access version is exclusive to the Epic Games Store, but \"later on it will come to other platforms.\" They describe the early access development period as a \"journey\" of sorts, similar to how Hades turned out: just to give you an idea of how long it might take until the full release.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGlhtNI7-x0\nThe post Summer Game Fest confirms Witchfire early access is exclusive to Epic Games Store appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation brought several small but important details coming to The Last of Us universe, including some details about what is now a standalone multiplayer title set within the post-apocalyptic setting.\nOriginally, a multiplayer component was planned for inclusion in the release of The Last of Us Part 2. But before that game released, Naughty Dog opted to cut that portion of the game and instead focus on the campaign. At the time, it was also clear that the multiplayer experience was likely still in the works, and was expanding in scope. Today’s reveal makes clear that expansion has broadened out to be its own full game.\nThe game has been in the works for roughly two years as of now. It includes a new cast of characters, though many of the tools those characters are using seem to be similar to those we saw in the campaign of The Last of Us Part 2; the characters wield rifles and Molotov cocktails even as chaos unfolds on the overgrown streets below them.\nNaughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann was open in admitting that they would not be sharing extensive details on the project at this time, but did share a piece of concept art that showed survivors overlooking what appears to be the city of San Francisco.\nWe still have something of a wait before we’ll be able to play the game, as Druckmann implied we’d be seeing more of the project sometime next year in 2023.\nEarlier today, a leak helped confirm that The Last of Us Remake is on the way, and today's Summer Game Fest also confirmed that progress is continuing with The Last of Us TV show, starring Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, as well as news that the game's vocal stars, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, would be taking on some meaningful roles in the TV project.",

          "description": "Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann took the stage at Summer Game Fest to reveal new details about HBO’s upcoming The Last of Us TV series.\nFirst, he revealed a new still from the show, posted above, that reveals the first face shot of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey in the roles of Joel and Ellie, respectively. Prior to this, we’d only seen the characters from behind. The image comes from an episode directed by Druckmann himself, who describes the show as “the most authentic video game adaptation yet”. \nDruckmann then brought Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voice Joel and Ellie in the games, to reveal that the actors appear in the show in undisclosed roles. \nThe Last of Us is set to premiere on HBO Max sometime in 2023. The show is being helmed by Druckmann and Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame.",

This lengthy look showed off traversal, combat, and a brief taste of what we could expect from the upgrade system. At today's Summer Game Fest, a new trailer debuted, giving us a deeper look at Nightwing's gameplay.\nWith Batman supposedly dead, Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood have banded together to keep Gotham's streets safe. Nightwing was long an understudy of Batman and also trained as a trapeze artist as a child.  In the new footage, we see both of these influences in his fighting style. He's brutal at close range, can create distance with his acrobatic flexibility, and has gadgets galore at his disposal.\nIn most of the gameplay, he's in his traditional black and blue garb, but we also get a brief look at him in a different ninja-like suit, which you'll be able to craft by gathering specific components.\nGotham Knights is slated to release on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and also PC. I hope it lives up the Arkham series' legacy, but also hope the inclusion of cooperative play gives it a new identity that is every bit as enthralling.",

He first revealed the title during The Game Awards 2021. But today, he and developer Inflexion Games showed off the studio’s first title with a brand new trailer.\n“For this reveal,” explains senior system designer Alexei Pepers in a blog post, “we wanted to pack the trailer with new footage and details for our community to dig into: More giants! Expanded base building! Calculating Automatons! But one new feature we felt needed a little more of a deep dive was the Realm Cards.” These cards give players the power to help craft the game’s procedural world and alter the experience. Check out everything in the video below. \n\n\nThe team further explains the card-based concept for the game on their website.\nNightingale is still set to release at the end of this year on PC, but today’s trailer didn’t reveal a specific date.",

          "description": "After an announcement in April, today’s Summer Game Fest presentation gave us a more in-depth look at American Arcadia, the new game from Out of the Blue Games, the makers of Call of the Sea.\nPlayers control Trevor Hills, a resident of a strange city call Arcadia, a seemingly futuristic utopia (rooted in 1970s design sensibility) in which everything looks clean and progressive. However, the city’s pristine appearance is an illusion, as the entire thing is a reality TV show for people to watch from the outside, in which one’s popularity can tank and put your actual life at risk.\nTrevor is on the run from the constant surveillance, leading to what looks like a number of frantic chase scenes. In some, he’s being watched by floating drones that are tracking and recording his movements. In another sequence, we see Trevor desperately trying to stay ahead of police or security that are trying to take him in. And in yet another gameplay moment, he makes a death-defying leap from a high platform dive into a pool far below.\nAs the trailer wraps up, the story pans out to someone apparently outside of Arcadia, looking at the domed city from its exterior, vowing to help get him out of there. In actuality, this brief sequence is representative of the other main pillar of gameplay, in which you control a 3D first-person experience that includes hacking and puzzles. \nAmerican Arcadia clearly draws more than just a little bit of inspiration from the classic film, The Truman Show. But the added 1970s aesthetic and focus on man-on-the-run action gives it a unique vibe. And satirizing or commenting on the questionable values of reality TV certainly feels like a timely subject.\nPublished by Raw Fury, American Arcadia is heading to console and PCs at a yet-to-be announced future date. Check out the full trailer below.",

          "description": "Even though the manga is entering its final saga next month (with years of stories to go, though), there's plenty of One Piece content to consume in the near future. At Summer Game Fest, One Piece Odyssey, ILCA's upcoming JRPG featuring the Straw Hat Crew, had a debut trailer introducing the cast and showing off some of the environments players can expect to explore. \nThe trailer, which you can watch above, gives each confirmed Straw Hat a spotlight as their ship, the Thousand Sunny, rockets into the sky. They're up there because of a strange cloud that forms above the seas while a Knock Up Stream kicks the ship into the air before one of Franky's Coup De Burst propels them even closer to danger. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Chopper, Franky, Robin, Brook, and Franky are all here, although new-ish-comer Jinbei is unfortunately nowhere to be seen. \nAs for in-game footage, we see some exploration of the world, and you can control more of the cast than just Monkey D. Luffy, so if you're a big Zorro, Sanji, or Chopper fan, you'll get to take direct control of them at some point. \nOne Piece Odyssey doesn't have a release date yet, but it is coming this year, according to the new trailer. It'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC whenever it does arrive.",

Not only does it have a new update for the PC version and some recent DLC, but a console version of the 4X game is also coming on November 4. The footage above shows a short clip of the console version in action, but I'm sure we'll see more of how Humankind is transitioning to controllers in the months ahead.\nA new PC DLC available now is titled \"Cultures Of Latin America,\" which, I'm sure you've guessed, adds new cultures, narrative events, and more based on Latin America. It costs $8.99 to add a Latin heritage to your Humankind civilizations. Here's a handy bullet-pointed list of features for this new content drop: \n6 New Cultures: Caralans, Nazca, Taíno, Inca, Argentinians, and Cubans\n6 New Wonders: Pyramid of the Sun – Teotihuacan, Maracana Stadium, Salar de Uyuni, Salto Angel, Lençóis Maranhenses, and the Atacama Desert.\n9 Independent Peoples\n15 Narrative Events\n30+ New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy\nBut that's not all. Amplitude is releasing a \"major update\" for the PC version of Humankind today, which also implements a reworked surrender system, rebalances war support modifiers, gives infrastructure yield previews, and adds unique wonder effects. There's even more in the update, so if you're a Humankind fan, you have plenty to check out in the game starting today.",

          "description": "Today’s Summer Game Fest livestream provided a new look at Marvel’s Midnight Suns, Firaxis' upcoming superhero RPG, including a release date and two new playable heroes. \nMarvel’s Midnight Suns swings to stores on October 7, and a new cinematic trailer pulled the curtain back on Spider-Man (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal) and Scarlet Witch. These fan-favorite heroes join the likes of Ghost Rider, Captain America, and Magik to battle Lilith, Mother of all Demons. Not to be outdone by our do-gooders, the trailer also revealed Lilith's line-up of corrupted antagonists: Venom, Sabertooth, Hulk, and interestingly, Scarlet Witch again. \n\n\nFiraxis also laid out four different versions of the game, each offering its own batch of goodies. They are:\nStandard Edition ($59.99): PS4, Xbox One, and PC base game.  \nEnhanced Edition ($69.99): PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version that includes five premium skins.\nDigital+ Edition ($79.99): Available on all platforms and includes 11 premium skins. \nLegendary Edition ($99.99): Available on all platforms and includes 23 premium cosmetic skins plus a post-launch season pass. \nMarvel’s Midnight Suns will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Firaxis plans to launch a Switch version at a later date. We recently spent a few hours playing the game, and you can read our impressions here or watch us take on Fallen Venom in this episode of New Gameplay Today. Be sure to also catch up on our behind-the-scenes making of the game by visiting our cover story hub.",

That’s exactly what happened in the new Goat Simulator 3 trailer. \nOddly enough, if you’ve kept up with video game news and trailers for years, the Goat Simulator 3 reveal trailer might have seemed highly familiar initially. That’s because it was riffing off of the Dead Island 2 trailer released many years ago. In that trailer, a man attempts to go for a beachside jog with headphones blasting music into his ears, and throughout the run, he’s oblivious to the zombie carnage around him. That’s exactly what happens in this Goat Simulator 3 trailer, except the big carnage-causing reveal isn’t zombies – it’s goats. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAnother odd thing about the Goat Simulator 3 trailer is that the last Goat Simulator game was the first one. This means the team is completely skipping over Goat Simulator 2, it seems, which is as chaotic as the series itself. \nGoat Simulator 3 is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, this fall. \nWhile waiting for Goat Simulator 3, read Game Informer’s Goat Simulator review. \nAre you excited about Goat Simulator 3?

          "description": "Former Blizzard alumni are bringing their RTS chops to a new game from Frost Giant Studios with Stormgate. The debut trailer, which you can watch above, debuted at Summer Game Fest this afternoon.\nTim Morten, production director and CEO of Frost Giant Studios, joined Summer Game Fest host Geoff Keigley on stage to reveal a little about the new Strategy title. He describes the titular Stormgates as portals that open during solar storms that unleash the Infernal Host onto a future Earth. The trailer showed a taste of both the demonic-looking Infernal Host faction, along with the second announced race, the Human Resistance, which is represented in the footage by the archeologist, and possibly the cool-looking mech. More factions will be revealed in the future, but those were the only two Morten would confirm during today's reveal.\nMorten says Stormgate is built for approachability and is set to be free to play but won't have any pay to win transactions or NFTs. Its also going to be designed for more social interaction. Stormgate's campaign can be played cooperatively. It'll also have 3-player \"open-ended co-op\" and support for 3v3 PvP battles, along with 1v1 for those who want a more personal galactic struggle.\nStormgate will be entering beta in 2023, and interested players can sign up on the game's website for the chance to participate in the test.",

The upcoming first-person shooter is set against gothic backdrops, with fantastical creatures standing in your way. First announced back in 2017, the game has been in development for some time now, so it's great to see it in action and inching closer to a full release. \nThe trailer, which you can watch above, showed off the gunplay, the ability to freeze enemies, ways to use the environment to distract them, bow-and-arrow attacks, and a stable of other cool magical powers. Set in an alternate reality, Witchfire centers on a deadly war raging between witches and the church. \nThe biggest announcement is that the game is entering Early Access soon. Right now, it is currently only announced for PC and is set to appear on the Epic Games store. So if you're looking for a dark fantasy shooter, keep your eyes open for more details to play the game earlier.",

The extended demo took players on a rain-soaked through Dark Water, a mission that sees Task Force 141's attempt to disarm a missile on an ocean oil rig. \nThe video featured Soap and Ghost infiltrating the rig off the Gulf of Mexico during a ferocious storm. Their mission begins quietly as the pair, alongside new teammates such as Mexican Special Forces Operator Alejandro, stealthily picks off targets as they work towards their objective. As you may expect, things don’t go as planned. The battle escalates along with the weather as the action moves to the deck of a ship that gets tossed and turned by the violent waves. Showing off the game’s physics system, cargo crates constantly slide across the deck, providing ever-changing cover points for both the player and the enemy.  \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II launches on October 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

In anticipation of Saints Row's release, you'll be able to customize your Boss in an extensive character creator called Boss Factory and bring your creation into the final game when it launches on August 23. We got our hands on the Boss Factory early and had some fun concocting our ideal crimelord.\n\n\nIn this edition of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Alex Stadnik, Jill Grodt, and John Carson, put the Boss Factory through its paces, creating something truly monstrous in the process. We hope you like demonic eyes and the slickest, oiliest skin that only a dip in a vat of olive oil could produce. Everything from skull shaping to gradient hair coloring, limb prosthetics, makeup, and scars are on the table; it's really an impressive toolset for players to mess with. Because there's so much to customize, this is an extended NGT, so sit back and enjoy the mayhem you can unleash before even stepping into the dangerous streets of Santo Ileso.\nFor more on the full breadth of customizations available in Saints Row, including vehicles and weapons, check out our preview on the topic. We also saw a newer build of the game in recent weeks, showing the game's promising additions since it was delayed in February. Of course, if you haven't read it already, Issue #340 of Game Informer features Saints Row on the cover, where we dig into an extensive hands-on preview of the title.",

At today's Summer Game Fest, a new \"red band\" trailer debuted, alongside two gameplay sequences that show off the sci-fi horror game's pacing, combat, and ridiculous amounts of gore. \nProtagonist Jacob Lee dishes out plenty of punishment with sci-fi weapons and a familiar looking boot stomp. The trailer above is Glen Schofield's cut, showing just how violent and bloody the game can get. The footage below shows clips from two sequences. One with Lee in prison garb and another with him armored up and ready for war.\n\n\nThe Callisto Protocol is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on December 2.

          "description": "Last week’s Sony State of Play gave us a first look at gameplay for the highly anticipated Street Fighter 6. Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation opened with a second glimpse at the game, this time to add another fighter to the roster. Guile has entered the fight.\nThe news should surprise precisely no one, as Guile has been a fixture of the popular fighting game franchise for decades. However, it’s always fun to see the ways that Capcom is updating their most familiar warriors for a new outing, and the new trailer gave us a look at the well-coifed martial artist.\nGuile has always had ties to American culture and military elements, and that backdrop continues in the next installment. We see Guile fighting against a background environment very reminiscent of his early appearances, with a jet in the background, and the towering structure of what looks to be an aircraft carrier in the distance. Sailors and dock workers appear to gather and cheer on the fight.\nLike in the first-look trailer we saw last week, Guile’s moves feature some of the same flashy painterly effects that we first saw with characters like Ryu and Chun-Li. Those bright and colorful effects are a fun contrast to the new more realistic styling of characters provided through the use of the RE engine, the same engine used to craft games like Devil May Cry 6, Monster Hunter Rise, and Resident Evil Village.\nStreet Fighter 6 was confirmed earlier this week to be the farthest along in the series timeline, set after the events of Street Fighter 3. As such, this new look at Guile reflects a slightly older look for the character, but don’t worry; he still takes time before his trailer concludes to whip out a comb and fix his perfectly maintained hair.\nStreet Fighter 6 is aiming for launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and Steam sometime in 2023. Check out the full new trailer below.",

However, host Geoff Keighly surprised viewers with one stellar game long-since thought lost to the development void: Routine. \nFrom Lunar Software and Raw Fury, the first-person horror all about exploring an abandoned moon base, took the stage with an unsettling new trailer. With desolate lunarscapes, dilapidated empty hallways, and a grainy, filmic vibe, the game’s latest look was set to ratchet up the tension. Its nightmarish death-dealing robot makes it stand out from the rest of the showcase’s intergalactic titles, but the short clip gives little detail on what to expect or if the game’s direction has changed significantly since we last saw it. However, we do know that composer Mick Gordon, known for his work on the Wolfenstein and Doom series, is creating its musical score. \n\n\nHowever, the team behind the game has already posted a message to players on their website about Routine’s long disappearance.

Their goal was simple: get the relay back online, but upon entering the craft, they find it's in ruins thanks to some Xenomorphs. And not just one Xenomorph, but multiple. It's coming to consoles and PC sometime in 2023. \nYou can check out the reveal trailer below: \n\n\nThe trailer mainly was CG and featured a squad of just a few marines, but right at the end, it appeared that some gameplay footage began to play. This gameplay looked like XCOM or The Ascent in that it featured an isometric viewpoint with enemies rushing the soldiers across the screen. It looked great, but because it was just a snippet of gameplay, it's hard to tell exactly what to expect in Aliens: Dark Descent. Focus Entertainment describes it as an \"enthralling single-player squad-based action game set within the iconic Aliens franchise\" with \"real-time combat.\" \nHere's some additional information from Focus Entertainment: \nFocus Entertainment says players will command a squad as one unit thanks to intuitive controls, allowing Marines to automatically prioritize and execute \"complex actions in real-time, based on their respective skill sets and the environment around them.\" Players must leverage the surrounding environment to their advantage to seal off checkpoints, unlock shortcuts, and create safe zones.\nAliens: Dark Descent will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023. \nAre you excited for Aliens: Dark Descent?

Today, during the Upload VR showcase at Summer Game Fest, a hilarious gameplay trailer premiered and revealed the release period for Innersloth’s popular party game. You can watch the footage below. \n\n\nIn the trailer, crewmates discuss the imposter’s identity in the Cafeteria, using their hands to emote in increasingly ridiculous ways. Like in the original game, players run around the various facilities of the arena, completing small minigames to repair or organize the scattered points of interest. The change to 3D suits the loop well and adds to the tension; there will probably be plenty of jumpscares to go around. \nLike many of you, we loved the original game, scoring it an 8.5 out of 10: \n“Among Us released over two years ago, but the jellybean/astronaut online game is currently seeing a massive surge in popularity that began in early September. The world may have started out quarantine by playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a wholesome game about friendship and taking care of our islands, but after many months of pandemic life, we’re hungry for the void of space filled with chaos and deceit.”\nAmong Us VR launches on Meta Quest 2 and Steam VR this Holiday season.",

As you might expect, it looks gorgeous. The remake will also include the entire game and the Left Behind DLC. Plus, it's also in development for PC, but it doesn't seem like the PC release will be happening simultaneously with the PS5 release. \nYou can check out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nThe pre-order page reveals the standard PS5 edition will cost $69.99, while the special Firefly Edition will cost $99.99. It's unclear what the Firefly Edition will contain, as the page linked to it in Wario64's tweet no longer takes you to The Last Of Us Part 1. \nHere's a blurb of the game Wario64 caught on the listing: \nAnd here are some shots of the listing, as well as in-game screenshots, from Wario64: \n\nIt's unclear what exactly happened here – perhaps this was set to be revealed during today's Summer Game Fest showcase, or maybe Sony had other plans and accidentally hit the \"go live\" button on its website. Regardless, Wario64 caught it before that page went down. \nFor more, read Game Informer's The Last of Us review and our thoughts on The Last of Us Part II. \nAre you excited for The Last of Us Part I?

          "description": "Microsoft revealed today that a new Xbox app for 2022 Samsung Smart TVs will let Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers stream their games. However, that’s not all the company had to reveal today. \nIn a new Xbox Wire blog post, Microsoft discusses Project Moorcroft, which is seemingly its take on the PlayStation Plus Game Trials system launching with the revamped service on June 13. According to the blog post, the program will bring “the fun and discovery of playing new, curated demos of upcoming games to our Xbox Game Pass members,” and it will begin rolling out next year. It will start with “a focus on providing independent developers from around the world more opportunities to build excitement for their games.” \nXbox says participating developers will be able to see how their demos perform, and the company will compensate them too, “enabling them to bring their creativity to Xbox and reach new audiences with Game Pass.” Xbox also says that later this year, “it’s our intent to roll out the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play, from the cloud, select games they already own or have purchased outside the Xbox Game Pass library.” \nElsewhere in the blog post, Microsoft has revealed new colors for Xbox Design Lab. They include Soft Pink, Soft Orange, Soft Green, and Soft Purple. There are new Camo Top cases with matching side caps, too, including Mineral Camo, Arctic Camo, Forest Camo, Sandglow Camo, and Blaze Camo. Xbox Design Lab is launching in 11 new countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Slovakia, and Switzerland. Xbox Design Lab will come to Taiwan later this summer. \nFor more, read about how Xbox is bringing the Game Pass library to select Samsung Smart TVs later this month. \nAre you excited about these demos?

The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. \nThis wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. \nForza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: \n“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”\nAre you excited about the alleged crossover?\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Sony officially announced three TV shows last month – a God of War series at Amazon, a Gran Turismo show, and a Horizon series coming to Netflix – and these three joined the already-in-production Twisted Metal TV series. The latter has received plenty of updates, such as word that Anthony Mackie will star and Will Arnett will voice Sweet Tooth. Details about these other shows, though, have remained unknown. \nHowever, new details about Netflix’s Horizon show have reportedly leaked, including that it will be called Horizon 2074. This news comes from GamesBeat’s Jeff Grubb, as reported by Eurogamer. Grubb said Horizon 2074 will be “split between the timeline you see in the games and the timeline of where things begin to fall.” \n\n\nHe also said the idea is that the series will not be “a reboot or remake or reimagining of the game’s storyline” but will instead “take place parallel and explain other elements that happen,” according to Eurogamer. \nIf Grubb’s leaked details end up being true – mind you, this show sounds very early in production, so some things could change as well – then it sounds like we’ll be getting a lot of backstory and lore related to the fall of humanity. We might also learn how Earth gets to where it is at the start of Horizon Zero Dawn. Only time will tell for now. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Horizon Zero Dawn review and check out our thoughts on Horizon Forbidden West.

          "description": "We first heard the news of Cyberpunk 2077's anime two years ago, months before the sci-fi RPG's official release. Today, a new and gory mini trailer revealed the flashy grittiness of the upcoming Netflix show.\n\n\nThe Maelstrom gang is displayed in the short clip (seen above). The criminal faction, known for its obsession with prosthetic enhancements, conducts a ransom deal with a group of unnamed protagonists. A woman is stowed away in a small, fridge-like contraption until she's quickly rescued. This is Night City, after all, so violence ensues. Limbs are hacked off and blown to bits in eye-popping fashion, which might be no surprise as the acclaimed Studio Trigger (Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, Promare) is responsible for the art direction and animation. We can't hear any dialogue as cacophonic guitar riffs add flavor to the bloody action. Even so, the shocking violence and heavy atmosphere are reminiscent of CD Projekt Red's vision. \nNot much is known about the anime, but the Netflix blurb in the YouTube video reads as follows:\n\"The series tells a standalone, 10-episode story about a street kid trying to survive in Night City – a technology and body modification-obsessed city of the future. Having everything to lose, he stays alive by becoming an edgerunner – a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.\" \nThe show will exist in the same universe as the game, so come September, we might even get to see or hear about V's exploits!\nDoes the clip pique your interest?

          "description": "After a teaser trailer last year, DC and Warner Bros. Pictures have finally released an official trailer for its Black Adam movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.\nFeaturing arguably one of the brightest color palettes in all of the DCEU, this trailer provides some backstory to the anti-hero that is Black Adam before showcasing the strength of this character. And that strength is enough to seemingly rival Superman as Black Adam doesn’t so much as break a sweat when up against baddies, missiles, crowbars, and more. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this trailer explains how Black Adam came to be. Nearly 5000 years ago, some bad people enslaved the man who would become Black Adam. Those same people then killed him, but somehow, his son sacrificed his life to help his father become Black Adam – an ancient god bestowed with mighty powers. However, just as quickly as he gained those powers, he was imprisoned. The trailer reveals that in the modern-day, he is somehow freed from the tomb and ready to “unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.” \nThat unique form of justice will likely put him up against or on the paths of Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, Sarah Shahi’s Adrianna, Marwan Kenzari’s Ishmael, Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone, Bodhi Sabongui’s Amon, and Pierce Brosnan’s Dr. Fate. The director of Jungle Cruise, which also starred Johnson, Jaume Collet-Serra, is the director behind Black Adam. \nDC’s Black Adam hits theaters internationally on Oct. 19. It hits U.S. theaters two days later, on Oct. 21. For more, watch this teaser trailer from last year. \nWhat do you think of this trailer? Let us know in the comments below!",

This news comes by way of a fancy new release date reveal trailer that you can watch below. It’s worth watching, too, because it looks great, complete with plenty of turn-of-the-century action, gore, and western antics. Oh, and monstrous vampires – can’t forget about those. \n\n\n“Jump right into frantic, gory carnage in a vampire-infested Wild West as the trailer introduces gunslinger Rentier on his mission to eradicate the supernatural terror,” a press release reads. “As the star agent in his father’s undercover monster-hunting organization, his fight is also a personal war against the nightmarish leading figures in the vampire world. Take on Jesse’s role as the final line between humanity and the vampire threat, rise up to become a Wild West superhero and save the United States.” \nEvil West will feature third-person action gameplay with an arsenal of guns and other weapons. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. \n\nFor more about Wild West, watch its premiere trailer for The Game Awards 2020 and then check out this gameplay trailer from last year’s Game Awards show. \nAre you excited for Evil West?

          "description": "There are a few PlayStation studios that we haven't heard much from in a while, one of which is the Days Gone developers Bend Studio. That changes today with a blog post detailing the history of Bend Studio and giving a tiny hint at what the team is up to with its next project.\nThe post details the games Bend had developed in its nearly 30-year history, from the first days of the studio when it was known as Blank, Berlyn and Co., through the time it was known as Eidetic when it developed Bubsy 3D, the Syphon Filter series, and beyond. There's a lot of great history about the studio packed in there alongside concept art and more. But, what comes next for Bend Studio is a break from any series or franchise it's worked on or created before. \n\"We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you. We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right,\" writes Kevin McAllister from Bend Studio.\nThis is the second time Bend has mentioned its new project, with the first word coming from a tweet last year. While the next game from the studio won't be Days Gone 2, nor a return to Syphon Filter, it at least looks to be learning and building from those prior works. Additionally, whether this new IP will be part of Sony's new initiative to develop more live service games remains to be seen.\nBend Studio also took the opportunity to debut a new logo in the blog post, which you can see above. The logo treatment is a nice change in design from the previous iterations since it's now modular and can be fitted into different aesthetics for various occasions.\nFor more on Bend Studio's former projects or what never came to be, check out what the studio pitched for a sequel to Days Gone that never saw the light of day.",

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
