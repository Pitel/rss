          "description": "Into the hive mind.\n2023 has swarmed us with quality games. So many that there aren’t enough hours in the day to play them all — and now, Cocoon has crept onto our screens to buzzing acclaim. Fortunately, if you’re busy as a bee, and can’t dedicate time to a marathon game, this is a nice quick one. Jeppe Carlsen, lead gameplay designer of Inside and Limbo, has teamed up with Geometric and Annapurna to unleash this wonderous puzzler. Those who love a good mind-boggler buggler will enjoy curling up in their cocoons for a few hours with it.\nYou play as a bug-like creature traversing an alien land, completing puzzles to progress. Sometimes you get a drone-type companion who helps break down fences, though it also gets eaten by certain monsters. Then there are the orbs – Cocoon’s point of difference. Each contains a world you can carry around with you, both forming part of puzzles and containing puzzles within. One orb’s land is filled with prismatic crystals, another contains puddles and reeds, another is a gooey membranous underworld.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The jump hasn't been smooth.\nThe Dragon Quest series is no stranger to spin-off titles, but few are as confusing as Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai. This action RPG is based on an anime adaptation of a manga based on the world of Dragon Quest, but it is never clear who the game is designed to appeal to. The few things it does well are buried under an avalanche of unengaging cutscenes that go on too long and simply don’t do the story they’re telling justice.\nThat isn’t to say that there aren’t some glimmers of hope hidden in this game’s runtime. The combat, for example, is competently designed if unimaginative in its implementation; characters have a basic attack, plus a selection of powers that they can unleash to deal more damage or to heal their allies. It is a system that has been used countless times before because it works well, letting you feel powerful as you wade through waves of enemies on the battlefield.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can't let go.

It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.\r\n\n\r\nThe new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077's recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man's Sky?\nWe've also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin's Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.\nRead more",

They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time.

Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.\nIt also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.\nRead more",

It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. \nHappily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.\nRead more",

Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.\nStill, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.\nRead more",

It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.\nAssassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm a fan of the modern Bethesda RPG, having spent nearly 100 hours with Fallout 4 - which, for me, is a lot more time than I'm usually willing to give up. My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.\nIf I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.\nRead more",

And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god.

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

          "description": "FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. \nRegardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.\nRead more",

It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. \nI was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank.

She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. \r\n\n\r\nI've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: \"Totally Fucked\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  \nAs with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's been a certain amount of confusion and alarm over the announcement of Nakwon: Last Paradise, a dingy third-person zombie survival adventure with a big emphasis on stealth, from the creators of Dave the Diver, a bright, breezy uramaki roll of a game that mixes restaurant management with side-on undersea exploration. Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?\r\n\n\r\nThing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake! Let's have a look at the trailer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I can build the thing without having to make all the constituent parts of it. I've recently gotten well into the modular city sets, to the extent that I look up discontinued sets on eBay and other such secondhand vendors. I don't actually get sets very often, but last week I built a police station, which can slot next to the bookshop I got for my last birthday. And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall.

Each uses their signature Persona and has their own advantages on the battlefield. For example, Ryuji can use Shock attacks via his Persona, Captain Kidd. He can also use his shotgun to hit multiple targets in one area. Ryuji's signature move, Brigantine Blitzkrieg, stuns all enemies in a straight line, even those behind cover. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Makoto and her Persona, Johanna, are strongest up close and personal.

          "description": "Many stories portray brave adventurers in their quest across the land to retrieve an artifact or stop a great evil. It's less common to see a story look at what happens after the quest ends. When, after the celebration and ushering in of a new era, the adventurers have to find a way back to a normal life. That's where Frieren starts.\n\n\nFrieren: Beyond Journey's End is a currently airing anime series from Madhouse, adapting the manga of the same name. It centers on the titular Frieren, an elven mage returning with her party after a decade spent taking down the Demon King. For her companions—the humans Himmel the hero and Heiter the priest, and Eisen the dwarven warrior—it was a lengthy journey.\n\n\nBut for Frieren, a decade is much, much smaller.

          "description": "KarmaZoo, a cooperative platformer party game developed by Pastagames and published by Devolver Digital has set a release date for November 14. In this unorthodox multiplayer experience, players seem to be encouraged to diminish the ego and prioritize their friends — or, in some cases, perfect strangers.\n\n\n\n\nIn the release date announcement trailer, it looks like this game is predominantly speed-based in the sense that players will be put into a course where they must make it to the finish line. But unlike most games of this archetype, KarmaZoo encourages selfless actions that benefit the collective over the self. \n\n\nFor example, one scenario might be a large ravine that is impossible to cross, with spikes at the bottom. If you were to jump into the ravine, your demise would trigger a tombstone to fall, providing your fellow players a stepping stone to cross it. In exchange for your noble sacrifice, you’d earn extra rewards at the end of the round. But, it’s not all about self-sacrifice — any positive action that benefits the team can be recognized and rewarded. So, it’s not a competition. It’s more a collaboration than anything else.\n\n\nI say all that, but for those readers who’re itching to beat their friends in Karma-based minigames, there will be a competitive mode added to the final release. So, no matter if you’re feeling like working with a group of friends (or strangers), or if you want some brutal competition, KarmaZoo has you covered.\n\n\nBased on the trailer, the game adopts this nostalgic, pixel-based art style that reminds me of indie games such as VVVVVV. I do worry that, thanks to the incredibly small sprite size for these characters, it’ll be a difficult one for those of us with poor eyesight. But, it might not be as big a deal in the game itself.\n\n\nKarmaZoo is set for release on November 14, and will be available for the Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. \n\nThe post Co-op party platformer KarmaZoo launches on November 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Detective Pikachu isn't the only live-action Pokemon offshoot in existence. There's also a Japanese TV series on the way, but don't expect to see more CG-animated Pokémon waltzing about in this one. Per Crunchyroll news, Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde — Pack Your Pockets with Adventure, or PokéTsume for short —is a Pokemon-inspired drama that aims to mine a very specific type of nostalgia. In particular, nostalgia aimed at folks who grew up on the original Game Boy and the first Pokemon games. \n\n\nMadoka Akagi is one such person, and she's about to rediscover the adventures she loved as a child. She's currently moving to Tokyo to pursue her ambitions as a creator, and receives something very special during the move. Her family gives her a Game Boy Pocket and Pokemon Red as a parting gift. Since she grew up playing Pokemon, she's immediately ready to dive back into its world. You can hear those familiar sounds and watch as her work life intermingles with her rekindled love for 'Mon in the first trailer for the drama. \n\n\n\n\nOnce a game freak\n\n\nThe actor in the role of Madoka is Nanase Nishino. She's played roles like Hiromi in Shin Kamen Rider, but she has an even better qualification for PokéTsume. She's a Pokémon fan in real life, so playing someone like Madoka should come naturally. \n\n\nPokéTsume was created as a collaboration between Pokémon Inc. and TV Tokyo. Its premiere is right around the corner as part of the network's MokuDora24 slot on October 19. \n\n\nBeyond this, there's also that live-action Pokemon series in the works at Netflix and a Detective Pikachu sequel. It's been a while since we heard anything about either, so maybe we're better off firing up our Game Boys like Madoka in the meantime. \n\nThe post Live-action Pokémon drama PokéTsume mines Game Boy nostalgia in its debut trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Blizzard hosted the first of their two Devstreams regarding the upcoming Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of the Blood, yesterday. And, I have to say...it was actually pretty good. In the trove of quality-of-life changes and enhancements coming to the ARPG, a buff to the drop rate of Uber Uniques was mentioned. Diablo Designer Joe Shely followed up on Twitter afterward confirming the buffed drop rate.\n\n\n\n\nPromising changes coming to Season of Blood\n\n\nIn the slide, Shely references, it mentions that players will have \"Greater access to Uber Uniques via Uber Duriel\". Duriel is the final of the five new bosses coming in Season 2. Players will need to farm materials from earlier bosses in order to spawn him. In the tweet, Shely states that Uber Uniques will still be rare. But players who farm Uber Duriel are going to see them eventually. In its current form, there's no way to farm Uber Uniques and even players who spend hundreds of hours farming a season aren't likely to see them drop.\n\n\nThis is an immensely positive change for Diablo 4, and makes me hopeful about future development. The ability to actually target farm Uber Uniques, even if they still have a rare drop, at least gives players a goal. Blizzard has a history of refusing to change their philosophy on certain mechanics like drop rates. But the decision to make a big change like this is a big improvement over previous Blizzard titles.\n\n\nI'm still reserving my overall judgment for the fate of Season 2 because that will depend a lot on the new content of the season. But a lot of the changes that were announced simply make the game better. Blizzard plans to support Diablo 4 for years, so we're still very early on its lifecycle. If it plans to stand with other long-lasting ARPG's like Diablo 2: Resurrected, Diablo 3, and Path of Exile, updates like this are a big part of it.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, launches on October 17 on all platforms.\n\nThe post Uber Uniques getting a buff to drop rate in Diablo 4 Season 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 has reached a new milestone by selling 25 million copies, with 3 million copies sold in the first week of launch. CD Projekt Red announced this today along with some interesting statistics regarding the IP and the studio's other games. \n\n\n\n\nAn image reveals what platforms players are enjoying the game's latest DLC, Phantom Liberty, on. The majority of Phantom Liberty's units have been sold on PC. Of the 86% on the platform, 10% are playing on GOG.com. There are 13% on Xbox Series X/S, and the remaining 20% are on PS5. These are all excellent numbers for CD Projekt Red, especially when one remembers the rocky launch the game had which eventually led to it being pulled off the PS Store. \n\n\nSome of the stats reveal what a mammoth task it was to resurrect the game. Phantom Liberty required 275 million PLN (almost $63 million) for direct production expenditure and 95 million PLN in marketing costs (almost $22 million). It took 360 developers from CD Projekt Red, and there were 3,600 people engaged in the project. \n\n\nLooking more widely, the studio also reveals that it has sold 100 million copies across its franchises, including The Witcher. This puts the studio in a good position as it prepares to expand its franchises with a new The Witcher game. \n\n\nCD Projekt Red's continued investment into Cyberpunk has clearly paid off, and although the studio has stated that Phantom Liberty is the last major DLC, it is not done with the IP just yet. It has also been announced that a live-action project is in the works in collaboration with Anonymous Content.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 has sold 25 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Pale Reach will have sailors exploring a frozen a new “icy expanse.”\n\n\nThe Pale Reach adds a new arctic biome. You’re tasked with following in the footsteps of a doomed expedition. I’ve read At the Mountain of Madness. I know exactly how this is going to turn out. In this new region is 11 new species of aquatic life, as well as their twisted aberrant alternatives.\n\n\nThat’s all I got. It’s more Dredge. Here’s the trailer:\n\n\n\n\nI reviewed Dredge when it launched back in March. I wasn’t too impressed. I summed it up by saying, “It’s hardly condemning to say, ‘this fishing game is about fishing.’ I’m mostly trying to stress that, ‘No, this is really about fishing.’” Because, like, it looks like a horror game – and it is – but it’s less unraveling a mystery and more selling the catch of the day. I felt that the fishing got a bit repetitive over time, and everything around it was a bit shallow.\n\n\nI'm not really certain if The Pale Reach expansion is going to do anything to fix that, but a lot of people enjoyed Dredge for what it was, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\nThe Pale Reach is coming to Dredge on November 16, 2023.

          "description": "CD Projekt Red, the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, has announced the studio will be partnering with Anonymous Content to produce a live-action “project” set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Anonymous Content is most known for producing works such as True Detective and Mr. Robot, but its catalog is overflowing with series such as Saint X, Shantaram, and The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.\n\n\nIt is currently unknown what form this live-action Cyberpunk story would take, but considering CD Projekt Red is working closely with Anonymous Content Studios’ head of television Garret Kemble, director of development Ryan Schwartz, and CCO David Levine, it would make sense to be a series, rather than a film on the big screen.\n\n\nWhat we do know is that this will be a brand new story in the Cyberpunk universe, not an adaptation. The announcement by CD Projekt Red says “the new project is at an early development stage and has currently commenced searching for a screenwriter to tell a brand-new story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.” While Kemble, Schwartz, Levine, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully will be producing, “the project will be developed in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.”\n\n\nIf this series or film or whatever this project manifests as can be as well made as the anime adaptation, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, it could be an exceptional experience. Because it’s a new story and not a direct adaptation, the project already sounds like a winner. Though it’d be nice if they were able to offer Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba a spot on the cast, even if they’re just walk-on cameos. \n\nThe post A live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project is in development appeared first on Destructoid.",

A PC version is in the works for a later date.\n\n\nA Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia was released on the NES in 1990, and it’s an odd one for the time period. In a lot of ways, it feels more like an early home computer game than a late NES title. It’s very freeform, and the world itself is like a very big puzzle. It takes a while to acclimate to it, and then you’ll likely need a few attempts at the game to finally see the end. It’s not impossible. It’s just a little overwhelming and unforgiving.\n\n\nThe collection also includes The Rescue of Blobette (also known as David Crane’s The Rescue of Blobette Starring a Boy and His Blob) is very similar but with smaller flipscreens and fewer colors.\n\n\n\n\nBoth games were developed by the legendary David Crane, who is best known for his work in Pitfall. The two games have their charm, but I don’t think they’re the best from the developer. Nonetheless, they’re unique, which counts for something.\n\n\nBoth games have been converted to Limited Run Games’ proprietary Carbon Engine.

This isn't the only reason Animal Crossing fans can get excited, as this month brings New Horizons' Halloween event that is held every year. \n\n\nIs Animal Crossing not your thing? There have been plenty of Lego Super Mario sets released since 2020, including the Larry's and Morton’s Airships Expansion Set which hit stores this year. \n\nThe post Lego Animal Crossing is too adorable appeared first on Destructoid.",

With all of Hell laid out before me, and so many ways to seize it for myself, I had to make the most of every turn and those precious two actions I could take. But that's the appeal of Solium Infernum, a remake of a classic strategy game from Armello creators League of Geeks; it offers a plethora of options but limits their frequency, making each turn a hellish clash of subterfuge, cunning, and two-faced lies.\n\n\nIn the annals of PC cult-classics, Solium Infernum is as much hidden as it is a gem. This strategy game from Victor J. Davis and Cryptic Comet certainly inspired some love when it first hit the scene in 2009. It picked up steam as a darling among bloggers at the time, even inspiring a parti…",

          "description": "The fact that Starfield has been nominated for several awards at the Golden Joystick Awards suggests it's a game that's doing quite well for itself. Of course, it has its faults as any game does, which is why Cyberpunk 2077's quest director has leaped to its defense.\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter, CD Projekt Red's own Patrick K. Mills responded to Starfield criticism, in which they insisted they liked the game.\n\n\n\n\nThe long and the short of it is, user Synth Potato gave a fairly lengthy assessment of the Bethesda RPG, specifically when it came to the studio's Creation Engine. Comparing it to Cyberpunk 2077, the post argues that Starfield is \"outdated,\", particularly in light of cutscenes and animations. This has been an ongoing feud of sorts for a few weeks on the Twitter-verse, but now we have an actual response from a CD Projekt Red developer.\n\n\nIt all comes down to design, Mills says\n\n\nIn response to this, Mills argues that Starfield's cinematics and animation are \"not down to engine so much as it is tools and design.\" While they admit they're not \"an engine guy,\" they do go on to say that Bethesda's scenes are \"staged in a more refined way.\"\n\n\nThe post chain goes into further detail, with Mills saying that the developer is \"just doing something different with [its] time and that's cool.\" The thread closes by adding that \"not every game can do every thing,\" and as such, not all features can be as refined as people would like.\n\n\nIt's up to you to decide whether you agree with this or not. For now, Cyberpunk 2077's quest director at least wants to throw some love Starfield's way.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 quest director comes to Starfield’s defense appeared first on Destructoid.",

With Konami's iconic horror series returning, many will be wondering when we'll get to experience this new era. As it turns out, perhaps to the surprise of no one, Silent Hill: Ascension may be heading to our screens for the spooky season.\n\n\nThat's according to a listing on Google Play, which says the interactive mini-series will be premiering on October 31. So, Halloween exactly, it seems.\n\n\n\n\nIt should be made clear that, as of writing, the producers and developers of Ascension have not actually confirmed whether this is the date the experience will launch. However, Google Play also doesn't say that this is a placeholder date, so this could be the real deal.\n\n\nLike Bandersnatch, but not\n\n\nFor those who aren't aware, Silent Hill: Ascension is an interactive live-action series in which viewers decide on the outcome. It's being developed by J. J. Abram's Bad Robots Production company, along with Dead by Daylight studio Behavior Interactive and Genvid Entertainment.\n\n\nThe listing on describes it as a thrilling new \"streaming service\" that \"follows multiple main characters from locations around the world tormented by new and terrifying SILENT HILL monsters.\"\n\n\nWe were treated to a pretty creepy trailer a few months back. Ascension is essentially a spin-off and, from what we understand so far, could deviate slightly from what we know and love about Silent Hill. However, we'll know more as and when the interactive experience airs.\n\n\nWe're also still waiting to hear more about Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2. There will be many who are looking forward to this modern take on one of the most influential horror games of all time. Equally, there will be those who are skeptical about whether it can do the original justice.\n\nThe post Silent Hill: Ascension to premiere on Halloween, according to listing appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari has announced that the next in line for Sneakybox’s series of remakes is Berzerk: Recharged. The press release says that it will be released “later this year,” which is a pretty small window of time by development standards.\n\n\nDesigned by Alan McNeil, Berzerk was first released in 1980 in arcades, followed by ports on the Atari 2600, 5200, and Vectrex consoles. It was first published by Stern, but Atari proudly bought back the property during a round of acquisitions this year. \n\n\nSomething like this was inevitable, as Atari CEO Wade Rosen sounds like a fan. I don’t blame him. I’m not big on that primordial era of video games, but Berzerk is something special. It’s a multidirectional shooter where you navigate mazes and blast robots. You also frequently find yourself accosted by a bizarre smiling face called “Evil Otto” who is indestructible. He’s here to make sure that you keep spending quarters.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond updated graphics and a soundtrack by frequent collaborator Megan McDuffee (River City Girls), Berzerk: Recharged will also upgrade the gameplay with twin-stick controls. You’re put through 20 “hand-crafted” mazes to compete for leaderboard supremacy. There’s also a two-player coop, which is standard for the series.\n\n\nWhile Berzerk: Recharged doesn’t have a solid release date, it’s targeting PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS. In the meantime, you can satisfy your Evil Otto cravings with Berzerk Enhanced Edition for the actual Atari 2600, which releases on November 17, 2023.\n\nThe post Berzerk: Recharged is next in line for Atari and Sneakybox’s remake series appeared first on Destructoid.",

Then a plethora of upcoming changes were discussed, most of which on the surface should improve Diablo 4 in a big way.

It is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One platforms.\n\n\nStray Souls takes place in the town of Aspen Falls, where protagonist Daniel has inherited his Grandmother’s house. He renovates the interior and quickly sells it on the booming real estate market to afford his education.\n\n\nNo, I’m joking. The town is full of monsters. Of course it is.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot centers around Daniel discovering he’s part of a ritual that was set in motion at his birth. Stray Souls is based on Japanese survival horror games and carries a bit more than a whiff of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. However, it promises “mind-bending puzzles” and a choice-driven narrative. It’s by a small team, but it carries with it the fancy gloss of the Unreal 5 Engine. Plus, it sports the legendary Akira Yamaoka as a guest composer.\n\n\nI don’t know. The trailers show a lot of what seems familiar. The store blurb also states that its combat features “soulslike precision.” It kind of feels like its selling itself based on the merits of other games, rather than what it brings itself. Nonetheless, I like checking out horror from smaller developers, so it might be worth a look.\n\n\nStray Souls is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on October 25, 2023.\n\nThe post Horror game Stray Souls locks in a release date of October 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island — what a mouthful — will be the 6th game in the mainline Shiren the Wanderer series. The last new entry we saw in this series was The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, which came out back in 2016.\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement trailer gives insight into what this iteration of Shiren the Wanderer entails. Supposedly, a vast treasure lies in wait in the dungeon of Serpentcoil Island, and who else deserves to claim it than Shiren and Koppa? It’s adopting a chibi-fied, cartoonish aesthetic, which lines up perfectly with the “back to basics” concept the trailer mentions.\n\n\nAs with many other roguelikes, this is a game where you will die (a lot). And, if and when you do die, you also lose everything you have gathered during that run. So strategy and careful movement becomes incredibly important for your survival. Especially with procedurally generated, turn-based dungeons that reset every run. I can see several scenarios playing out in my head that would make me panic beyond imagination. \n\n\nScreenshot via Spike Chunsoft\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Shiren the Wanderer, it's the main pioneer of the Mystery Dungeon franchise. Western gamers likely know this better for its spinoffs like the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Chocobo Mystery Dungeon series'. So, if you’ve experienced either of those, you'll have a good idea of what to expect here. But if not, you can take the leap of faith when Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island launches exclusively for the Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2024.\n\nThe post Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island launches February 27, 2024 in the West appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember Gigantic? Gearbox Publishing certainly does. And it looks like the company is hoping fans of the doomed hero shooter do as well. The company sent emails to some former Gigantic players, inviting them to come together once more for a \"limited time throwback event.\" \n\n\nIt seems to have taken some folks by surprise. The humble Gigantic subreddit hummed back to life after players began sharing their invitations. The rise of excitement is somewhat heartwarming to see. It was only two months ago former players were asking: \"Does anyone else miss Gigantic?\" Well, for a short time, Gigantic will rise from the ashes once more.\n\n\n\"Play Gigantic once more on October 5 at 21:00 CEST - October 7 at 06:00 CEST,\" reads the email invite, \"and re-live the good old days of playing this beloved strategic hero shooter!\"\n\n\n\n\nIs the throwback event setting the stage for a Gigantic comeback?\n\n\nGigantic will be playable for a select chosen few starting tomorrow, according to the email. The event will last for only two days, and there are limitations. Beyond being \"invite only\" to those who received the email, the throwback event can't be streamed or recorded — according to an invitee. And this could be the reason: The game may not be the same as fans remember.\n\n\nAccording to some invitees, the game is going to come with a suite of updates. The email they received mentioned \"Revamped Content\" such as a Fortune Card System, a Progression System, loadouts, customization options for weapon skins, and more. The new version apparently includes a Rush Mode, a \"fast-paced and action packed\" mode for a \"simplified\" experience.\n\n\nDoes this mean Gearbox is testing the waters for a Gigantic return?

          "description": "In Fortnite's goal to become \"multi-game ecosystem\" and a creative platform, Fortnite will soon require age rating for all first and third-party content. To make this happen, Epic has formed a partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition, or IARC. If you fashion yourself a creator on Fortnite, this new regulation takes effect starting on November 14.\n\n\n“When you are ready to publish your island to Fortnite, you will fill out the IARC content rating questionnaire before you submit your island to be published and reviewed by Epic moderators,” the Fortnite Team wrote in a blog post. \n\n\n“When the questionnaire is complete, you will receive an age-based IARC rating for the content of your island along with region-specific ratings from IARC-participating rating authorities. These ratings will automatically be applied and prominently displayed prior to access.”\n\n\nIt appears that the IARC will consult regional ratings boards such as the ESRB for North America, PEGI for Europe, ACB for Australia, USK for Germany, and others based on where the player is based. This solution seems to be one designed to protect both creators and audiences — especially younger audiences — to create and consume Fortnite experiences tailor-made for their comfortability level. \n\n\nWhile this regulation doesn’t go into full-effect until November 14, the abovementioned IARC questionnaire goes live on October 16. It's to ensure creators have enough time to rate their experiences before the cutoff deadline of — you guessed it — November 14. According to the blog post, any experience left unrated will be delisted on that date, so make sure to abide by the new rule. We’d hate to see the islands you spent so much time and hard work on go dark.\n\nThe post Fortnite is adding individual age ratings for all of its experiences appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC.\n\n\nI kind of had to do some digging on this one since the press release omits certain things, like the fact that this is a compilation of three previously released games. The first episode of The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout dropped back in 2018, with the other two following in 2021. Only the first act landed on Xbox One and PS4, with the others arriving on PC. This point is moot, however, because they’ve been delisted from all platforms. Going forward, this is going to be the only way to experience them.\n\n\nI missed them the first time, which is funny because on my wishlist of games I want to see is a decent game based on Brian Jacques’ Redwall book series. In my youth, I was an avid fan of the series and read through a good chunk of them. If you’re unfamiliar, they’re essential fantasy novels, but instead of Elves and Orcs, it’s mice and rats. They’re joyful and well-written books, even if they tend to be pretty formulaic.\n\n\n\n\nSo far, it looks… okay. I don't think the games were exactly well-received the first time around, so hopefully, Soma Games did something with the feedback they received. I don’t think the trailer is doing it any favors. Usually, trailers are really heavily edited to show only the most polished slices of gameplay, and this one looks pretty raw. It’s a linear, action-adventure narrative told in three parts. I find it funny that it says, “An adventure for all the family,” directly after showing what looks like conflagrated rats. The books weren’t exactly flowery all the time, so it’s hard to have Redwall without the war.\n\n\nGosh, good times.\n\n\nThe Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC on December 1, 2023.\n\nThe post Rodent adventure The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is releasing December 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A port for Rockstar's famous Red Dead Redemption moseyed onto the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 (but compatible on PS5) in early August. Sadly, the celebratory hoedown came to an abrupt halt when players learned the game would go for $49.99 and run at 30 FPS. And while that don't beat all, Rockstar has at least fixed half the issue. The port of Red Dead Redemption got an update that silently added support for 60 FPS, so long as you're saddled up with the PS5. I will slow my Western puns for now.\n\n\nRockstar released update 1.03 on October 3 and made nary a fuss about the framerate change. The Red Dead Redemption port now has a framerate toggle within its Display menu, allowing PS5 owners to run it at the accepted standard of 60 FPS. Here is the full patch notes for 1.03 via Rockstar Games:\n\n\n\nAdded an option to enable 60 FPS when played on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility\n\n\nAdded an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game\n\n\nGeneral bug fixes and improvements\n\n\n\n\n\nRedemption partially arrives for PS5 owners\n\n\nFans weren't thrilled with the news of the port to say the very least. While its performance on the aging Switch is arguable, it should be easily capable of running at a higher framerate on Sony's more powerful machines. The game got a 4K patch and a framerate boost when it went backward compatible on the Xbox One X system in 2018, after all. Fans also weren't enthused by its hefty price tag, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick calling it \"commercially accurate.\" \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption is available for download on the Switch and PlayStation 4 for $49.99. It comes with the base game along with the Undead Nightmares DLC. \n\nThe post Red Dead Redemption port adds 60 FPS for PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We also got confirmation the beta would eventually make its way to PC and Xbox. Now we have the exact dates and times the multiplayer beta for Modern Warfare 3 will be available.\n\n\nMinutes to midnight\n\n\nIf you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 on PS4 or PS5, as stated above, you’ll be among the first invited to jump into the multiplayer beta. It should be unlocked for you from October 6 (Friday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\nFor those PlayStation fans who didn’t pre-order Modern Warfare 3, you’re up next — you can play the beta from October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 10 (Tuesday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\nOK — now it’s time for everyone else (kind of). If you pre-ordered the game on PC or Xbox, it’s your turn to take a spin from October 12 (Thursday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. It’s important to note that PlayStation players can also partake during this time.\n\n\nAnd lastly, we have a period where the beta will truly be accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of if you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 or not. If this sounds like you, give the multiplayer beta a shot from October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 16 (Monday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\nWe hope that helps you to make the most of this — admittedly short-lived — beta.

As French publication Libération reports, three of the arrests were made yesterday, and two were made today. \n\n\nIt is not known yet whether the arrested individuals have been charged, and if so for what. However, it is reported that the arrests come following an investigation of complaints by the Solidaires Informatique union and two victims. According to one of the plaintiff's lawyers, Maude Beckers, the case encompasses more than individual behavior and also concerns \"systemic sexual violence.\"\n\n\nThus far, only two arrested individuals have been named. The first is former Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, and the other is former editorial vice president Tommy François. Both individuals left Ubisoft in 2020.\n\n\nOver the years, reports emerged painting a pattern of sexual harassment at Ubisoft. When these allegations began making headlines, Ubisoft claimed it would launch an investigation and take the appropriate disciplinary actions. Since then, many higher-ups have stepped down or been terminated from the company, including those former execs and others. The allegations were enough to also trigger a legal investigation.\n\n\nIn a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft said: \"\"Ubisoft has no knowledge of what has been shared and therefore can't comment.\"\n\nThe post Former Ubisoft execs arrested following sexual harassment investigation appeared first on Destructoid.",

From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started.

It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now. \nAre you going to be picking up any of these Animal Crossing Legos when they release? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. \nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game. \nDo you like Red Dead Redemption or Red Dead Redemption II more? Let us know in the comments below!",

After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. \nIf you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more. \nYou can read Game Informer's Mirag…",

It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. \nToday, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is \"driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take\" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters',\" a press release reads. \"Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. \nFor the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is \"a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring.\" \nYou can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players \"will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.\" \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the \"Little Man\" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.\nThe Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam.

Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.\nIn addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures.

Despite our enjoyment, many players encountered severe matchmaking issues that made it tough to play the game given its always-online nature. Now, just under two weeks after the game's launch, developer Starbeeze Studios says the matchmaking issues are fixed. \nThe team has also revealed the game's first update will launch this month. Plus, Starbreeze says more than 3.1 million unique players played the game last month, with the peak concurrent player count hitting 124,254. Starbreeze \"will now intensify the commercial activities around Payday 3, after partially pausing these during the previous week,\" it says, with pla…",

Phantom Fury is not the first game to explore this playground, and it likely won't be the last, but playing the demo left a good first impression. The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.\nPhantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision.\" \nSega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that \"there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time.\" \nSega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.",

          "description": "Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!\nDark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
