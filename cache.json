          "description": "How’s it hanging?\nTrailers, screenshots, and previews of A Little to the Left paint a picture of a tidying game about making things neat – and a cat interferes and cats are nice. That’s not inaccurate, but there’s a lot more going on in Max Inferno’s first game. Presenting you with one-screen scenes of real-life objects like books, batteries, and cleaning products, the game invites you to get organising. The simplest asks are to just make a drawer neat, or straighten some pictures, but it soon becomes more sophisticated, launching into magical realist daydreams of how shadows and stars might be arranged to satisfy some sort of imagined rule set.\nAnd it’s the imaginary nature of the rules that surprises most. Re-assembling a torn picture has a clear and obvious objective, for instance, but what is the right way to line up some pencils? Shortest to longest? Yellowest to purplest? Pointiest to bluntest? There’s no one right answer, so the game will usually accept whatever is your personal intuition – then shock you with the fact that there were other ways of seeing what seemed certain.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol.2, on the same basis, is equally disappointing.\nThere are ten titles on board this follow-up to Vol.1 — four of which are already available to buy separately on Switch eShop — nicely presented as little cartridges on the menu, each with a variety of options. The language barrier issue affects three titles, one of which is the aforementioned Mega Man Battle & Fighters.

          "description": "Newly announced MMO shooter Project LLL is doing several unusual things. For one, it's set in a science fiction  world in which post-apocalyptic South Korea, the 10th century Byzantine Empire, and a 23rd century future are all somehow colliding. For two, it was revealed yesterday not with a brief logo or a show-nothing cinematic trailer, but with a nine minute video comprehensively depicting the actual game. Watch it below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought.

It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. \nIts captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.\nRead more",

The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it's a lot of fun when you're mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It's a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you'd like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can't get any better than this.\nRead more",

So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn't call him \"Boy!\", and also he won't shut up under any circumstances.\nRead more",

You'll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you'd prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you're not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.\nAfterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They've got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you're short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don't forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic.

Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?\nOh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.\nRead more",

Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.\nAnyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.\nRead more",

But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.\nRead more",

Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It's now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it's been time well spent. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). \nMostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me. \nRead more",

          "description": "I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.\nSo, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.\nRead more",

It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window.

The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

Česko.Digital je komunita expertních dobrovolníků z mnoha oborů od IT přes projektové řízení až po marketing. Jejím cílem je budoucnost, ve které technologie slouží lidem, bez ohledu na čas, místo nebo sociální podmínky. Tato vize, společně s úspěšnými projekty, které Česko.Digital již realizovalo, zaujala společnost Google. Google.org, filantropická odnož Googlu, se rozhodla organizaci podpořit na 2 roky částkou 300 tisíc USD (přibližně 7,3 milionů korun), které Česko.Digital investuje do rozvoje komunity a do cílených aktivit, které pomohou snížit dopady digitálních nerovností (tzv. digital divide).",

          "description": "I got the music in me\nA few months ago, the Recording Academy announced it was adding five new categories to its annual Grammy Awards, including a new category solely for soundtracks to video games and other interactive media. A video game grammy award has been a long time coming, given how the medium has produced some of the most outstanding musical scores of the past 20 years. Just yesterday, The Game Awards announced its top picks for Best Score with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Metal Hellsinger, Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarock, and A Plague Tale: Requiem making the cut. None of those games are up for the inaugural video game soundtrack Grammy, but that probably has to do with release scheduling and other requirements that might not have been met.\nInstead, the five games nominated for Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media are:\nAliens: Fireteam Elite (Composer: Austin Wintory)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok (Composer: Stephanie Economou)\nCall of Duty: Vanguard (Composer: Bear McCreary)\nMarvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (Composer: Richard Jacques)\nOld World (Composer: Christopher Tin)\nYour guess is as good as mine as to what Old World is, but there are few recognizable names on that list. Bear McCreary is perhaps best known across the industry for his work scoring films like Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as well as video games like God of War and God of War Ragnarok. Austin Wintory is also a name you should know, given his work on titles like Journey and The Banner Saga trilogy.\nTo find out who takes home the inaugural video game Grammy, tune in to the Grammy pre-show on February 5, where this award is most likely to be handed out.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed, Call of Duty, and Aliens: Fireteam Elite among first video game Grammy nominees appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We miss you, Mei\nBlizzard has been dealing with all kinds of bugs since the release of Overwatch 2, and in a few instances, have had to remove certain characters from the game to ensure players don't use exploits in the game. Mei is the most recent hero to disappear from the roster, and now she's not expected to return for another couple of days. That's right -- the mid-season patch has officially been delayed.\nWhile the original announcement stated that the delay would be indefinite, an update as of today at 4:00 pm PST let us know that we only have to wait until the end of the week, because the new ETA for the patch is this Friday, November 17 at 11:00 am PST. Phew, don't scare us like that, Blizzard.\nhttps://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1592594536215158786\nThe patch will include \"balance changes, bug fixes, including those that affect Mei,\" as well as \"core content updates.\" The delay will also impact \"the delivery of Overwatch League Viewership Incentives & Perks from the Postseason matches during the period between Oct 30 - Nov 4, along with the rotation of cosmetics in the Overwatch League shop.\" The daily and weekly challenges also reset today like normal, along with the \"standard shop refresh.\"\nThankfully things aren't as bleak as they originally appeared, because the game never feels the same when any of the heroes are missing. After Bastion was pulled a few weeks ago for balance changes as well, the internet was flooded with memes, including some hilariously edited missing persons (omnics?) posters. I'm a bit torn about Mei's disappearance myself -- on one hand, I kind of miss the chaos of having an unhinged Mei player on my team, but I definitely don't miss getting and frozen, walled off, and icicled to the head. Regardless, a two day wait is nothing, and our favorite Arctic scientist will be returned to her rightful place soon enough.\nThe post Overwatch 2’s mid-season patch is delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "NieR gets ready to breach and clear\nThe NieR series has crossed over into the worlds of PUBG, Soulcalibur, and Final Fantasy XIV. And now, NieR also joins the cameo ranks of Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege.\nUbisoft revealed today that a NieR cosmetic bundle is making its way into Rainbow Six Siege, arriving on November 21. The bundle isn't the only one on the way, either. A stinger at the end teases more to come, with 2B's boots and this tagline: \"A YoRHa soldier is approaching... Glory to mankind!\"\nLooks like we'll learn more on November 21, when Ubisoft reveals the entirety of its next season, Operation Solar Raid. There, according to Ubisoft, we'll get more \"NieR goodness\" for Siege.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13DlspkIvE\nNieR and dear to our heart\nThe bundle shown off today is for Maverick, an Attack operator with a blowtorch. The set looks like it includes a cosmetic skin based off the brother Nier's appearance, rather than Papa Nier. I do like the design of the guns, as it's reminiscent of the black-and-gold aesthetic of the Shades. Grimoire Weiss is included in the bundle too, seemingly as a weapon charm.\nAs I mentioned before, this is hardly the first NieR crossover. Both the original NieR and NieR: Automata have crossed over into other games. In some cases, like Final Fantasy XIV's raid series, they even contain some additional details for fans.\nI doubt Rainbow Six Siege will hold any deep lore tidbits, but I can't rule it out. It's a goofy and enjoyable crossover though, and one that made me fondly reminisce on series director Yoko Taro's response in our latest interview with him.\nThe post The latest NieR crossover is with Rainbow Six Siege appeared first on Destructoid.",

While 3D Sonic games tend to be polarizing no matter what, many folks have taken to Frontiers, in part due to the promise of what this could bring for the future. Finally, I think Sega may have created a blueprint to follow for a really ace 3D Sonic game again (so naturally, they'll probably scrap everything and start over on the next go-around).\nUntil that happens, you can enjoy Frontiers a bit more thanks to some free DLC. In a collaboration with Capcom, Sonic is teaming up with the Monster Hunter series, complete with a new outfit and an extra minigame. It's not much, but if you're still playing through the core game (or going for a 100% rating), you can at least play around with the outfit. Note that you'll access it via the \"extras\" option in the main menu (before you load up a game).\nRemember that this is in addition to the free SA2 shoes DLC, which is available to everyone until January. Hopefully there's more on the way! Crossovers are perfect for the Sonic series, especially other Sega properties.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_2nN2jKRXg\nSonic Frontiers Monster Hunter DLC artwork:\nhttps://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1579624098485108737\nhttps://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1579624301820772352\nThe post The Sonic Frontiers free Monster Hunter DLC is out appeared first on Destructoid.",

Ultimate Ninja on. The most recent Naruto title was 2018's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Strikers, though some of the anime/manga series' spritely sluggers have since joined the roster of crossover characters in Epic Games' battle royale juggernaut Fortnite.\nNo doubt we will be hearing more news on this new Naruto trademark from Bandai Namco at some point in the near future.

          "description": "Scavenge the last hours before December\nThe free-to-play PvPvE survival shooter Scavengers is closing its doors. Studio Improbable confirms it will shut down Scavengers on December 16, 2022.\nIn an announcement, the team notes that it's been a while since its latest update. The reason for the closure looks to be a slowly dwindling player base for the shooter.\n\"The last few months have seen a decline in the playerbase, and whilst we explored many options to reinvigorate server population while the game is in early access, it became clear that it was unsustainable to continue development and live service,\" the statement reads. \"We’re all proud of what we accomplished, and are grateful to every player who took the time to play, even if it was just for a short while.\"\nThe studio says it plans to celebrate the next few weeks, leading up to the shutdown.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glYYdCz237o\nA jagged, gorgeous winter\nShown off at the 2018 Game Awards, Scavengers was originally in development at Midwinter Entertainment. The team was bought by Improbable in 2019, and Scavengers launched into an early access in 2021.\nIn May, Improbable sold Midwinter to Behaviour Interactive, where the team is now working on an unannounced project. A small team was left to keep Scavengers running, while the console versions were scrapped. Improbable said in a statement at the time that the cut was to help the company's announced focus on the metaverse.\nIt's a shame to see for the remaining Scavengers fans. Hopefully those who held out hope will see something they like in Midwinter's new project at Behaviour.\nThe post Multiplayer survival shooter Scavengers is closing down appeared first on Destructoid.",

That kind of mainstream recognition usually means there are some awesome collabs on the way, which is definitely true in this case. This time around, Riot teamed up with Nerf to create a life-sized replica of Jinx's classic blaster known as Fishbones, which was also featured in Arcane, as fans will remember.\nJinx's Fishbones is available for pre-order now (pre-orders close January 1, 2023, and will be shipping on December 31, 2022. The gun is a gargantuan 35 inches long, and features jaws that open and close as you shoot. It holds 18 total darts, shooting out a three round burst every time you pull the trigger. Fishbones also comes with a Jinx-inspired stand and \"display-worthy packaging\" for those who want to show it off for everyone to see. The NERF LMTD League of Legends Jinx Fishbones blaster retails for $169.99, and is available for pre-order on Amazon or directly from Nerf.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_BXWllD5k\nThe Jinx Fishbones collaboration is part of NERF LMTD, a \" premium, special edition, fan-focused line from the Nerf brand brings you some of the most iconic items from movies, video games, and entertainment with premium features and packaging.\" Other franchises that have been honored with a Nerf collab include Star Wars, Halo, Star Trek, Aliens, and G.I. Joe, just to name a few.\nThis has seriously got to be one of the coolest gaming merchandise crossovers I think I've ever seen, and absolutely something I wish I had when I was a kid. I've only touched League of Legends once in my life (that's a whole story for another day), but the second Nerf releases something from a game I play, I might just have to splurge and treat my inner child.\nThe post Nerf released a replica of Jinx’s gun from League of Legends appeared first on Destructoid.",

Neon Giant currently only has one notable title to its name — cyberpunk RPG The Ascent — but is currently developing an as-yet-unannounced first-person-shooter, set in an open-world environment.\nFounded in the spring of 2018, Neon Giant was formatively made up of a party of former AAA game developers, featuring talent pulled from best-selling franchises such as DOOM, Gears of War, Far Cry, and Bulletstorm. Selected by Epic Games as one of several studios to receive a monetary grant for its first project, Neon Giant would develop and release The Ascent on PC and consoles in 2021, where it would receive moderate-to-high praise from critics and players.\nWith this latest acquisition, Neon Giant will join a number of western developers recently picked up by Krafton. Other purchases by the holding company include Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds and Striking Distance Studios, who are currently busy putting the finishing touches to their gory sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol.\nThe Ascent is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post PUBG’s Krafton acquires The Ascent developer Neon Giant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Labored with NINTENDO RULES (tm)\nNintendo has released a new demo for its madcap sports title Mario Strikers: Battle League, giving Switch owners the opportunity to check out the colorful and chaotic soccer game free of charge. The demo is available to download from the eShop now.\nNintendo had previously released a trial for Mario Strikers prior to the game's launch back in June of this year, but that particular demo was locked to Nintendo Online subscribers. While this new demo can be accessed by all Switch users, it is still limited to Nintendo's precious limitations. For starters, only one game of the Cup Battle feature can be played before the option is locked out. In addition, players can only experience the \"Quick Match\" feature seven times, before that too becomes inaccessible.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1590517271679508482?s=20&t=t-qXago3izz8rLojADoTSA\nIt's likely that Nintendo is hoping to get more footy fans on board, given the coming of the FIFA World Cup. But it's going to be a tough sell. While Mario Strikers: Battle League is a perfectly fine multiplayer title for anyone who wants a kickabout with pals, the full release has also been criticized for being very barebones, while also suffering from a distinct lack of major content drops/roster expansions since its initial launch. At $60, it's a hefty ask for a game that has been particularly subdued during its honeymoon period.\nStill, if you and some pals fancy a bit of goofy footballing fun, then perhaps this new demo might help to win you over.

Kishimoto notes that he envisions Sonic Frontiers becoming one of the series' most important titles, ultimately shaping the future of the long-running franchise.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4\nLaunching November 8 on PC and consoles, Sonic Frontiers has, like most of The Blue Blur's games, been a divisive title, running the gauntlet of high and low scores from both critics and players. While many have praised the high-speed sequel's visuals and mechanical overhaul, the title has been criticized by some for its combat, \"boring\" environments, and bizarre juxtaposition of colorful, cartoonish characters with somber, monolithic enemies.\nRegardless, Sonic Frontiers has seen launch success. Over on the Steam platform, some 19,181 concurrent players were recorded at the game's launch, beating the previous series record — held by 2017's excellent throwback Sonic Mania. Whether Sonic Frontiers has the staying power to become the iconic release envisioned by Kishimoto remains to be seen, but this early admission that the title still has some way to go before developers will be pleased with the product does not go down smooth .\nSonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers director says team is examining feedback appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A historical whodunnit\nReal history is an interesting setting for games to use. Pulling in actual world events to tell a tale can be tricky, but Pentiment does it in stride.\nPentiment is a passion project from a small team of developers within Obsidian. It’s set in the tiny town of Tassing in Bavaria, in the late 15th and early 16th century. It’s a town with clear divides between the peasants and their fields, the townspeople’s crafted goods, and the double monastery looming just down the lane.\nEvery villager, sister, and monk in Tassing has a story. Each family has branches that grow out and interlock. It might seem too small a place to keep a secret. But as protagonist Andreas Maler soon discovers, those appearances are deceiving.\nIt’s a combination of history and detail, alongside a fan…",

Incredibly, Team Water came away with a perfect 45p score, meaning that the H2O lovin' squaddies ultimately won out in both Open and Pro battles, as well as winning the public vote.\n\nThis is one of the cleanest (no pun intended) sweeps in recent Splatoon history, and suggests that the Pokemon x Splatoon crossover community either really, really likes Water-type Pokemon, or that they simply converted their love of the wet stuff to fantastic in-game plays.\nYou can check out the full results below.\nPublic Vote\nTeam Grass: 25.80%\nTeam Fire: 33.60%\nTeam Water: 40.60%\nClout (Open)\nTeam Grass: 33.41%\nTeam Fire: 32.75%\nTeam Water: 33.84%\nClout (Pro)\nTeam Grass: 33.59%\nTeam Fire: 30.55%\nTeam Water: 35.86%\nThis special splatfest was, of course, held to help promote the release of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, both of which launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch on November 18. This event also represented the second splatfest result of the multiplayer shooter's new era. So, if your team took a drubbing this time around, it won't be too long before you can lock 'n' load for another weekend of gooey competition.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Splatfest result: Team Water makes a splash in Pokemon x Splatoon 3 event appeared first on Destructoid.",

Clearly more than worth the wait, Kratos and Atreus' latest head-chopping jaunt is clearly in contention for many critics and players' Game of the Year award, and is already set to be one of 2022's best-selling releases.\nGod of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok day one sales break franchise records appeared first on Destructoid.",

This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. \nUnfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. \nIf it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you tuning into the finale event for Fortnite Chapter 3?

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",

We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

          "description": "The original Dungeons & Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar. \nIn recent weeks, I had the good fortune to look at what Onslaught has in sto…",

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.\nYou can read her full statement below: \nMany of you have been asking about the MWII soundtrack release.\npic.twitter.com/UEqgpCTjUg\nNovember 3, 2022\nFor more, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on the score of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II?

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",
