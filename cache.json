          "description": "Hot dog!\nBack in the days of the Wii, one of the more interesting and bizarre major third-party releases was Epic Mickey, a project headed by Warren Spector—the renowned creator of the Deus Ex franchise. This 3D platformer placed the famed mouse in an unusually dark premise that presented him with various moral dilemmas, and though it had its issues, Epic Mickey certainly stood out as a memorable adventure for the mascot and did well enough to warrant a sequel and a weird 3DS spin-off. Now, Disney has decided to give the game a revisit with Epic Mickey Rebrushed, and though it still has some jank, we’re happy to report that this remaster fixes many of the original’s problems.\nEpic Mickey’s story begins with the titular mouse visiting Yen Sid’s workshop, where he quickly misuses the wizard’s magic paintbrush and inadvertently brings ruin to his prized project, a magical world for forgotten cartoons. Years later and long after forgetting the incident, Mickey is accosted in the night by a shadowy ink creature that drags him screaming into the world he destroyed, but not before he manages to grab the magic paintbrush on his way. Now abandoned in the Wasteland, Mickey needs to find a way to escape while either finishing the work he started or using his newfound power to help the toons who have been struggling to survive in the wake of the destruction he caused.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

          "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.\nFFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.\nRead more",

Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.\nRead more",

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our review praised the game for its \"trunk loads of atmosphere\" but called the constant need to craft stuff \"laborious\". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.\nBuuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.\nRead more",

It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\".

It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family.

They're accusing the publishers of Fortnite, EA Sports FC 24, Minecraft, Clash of Clans and others of misleading people -  specifically children - with their in-game premium currencies, and breaching European Union consumer protection laws. On a press site that summarises the results of various longer studies, they offer the below broad complaints about the practice.\r\n \nRead more",

You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass.

The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

          "description": "There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale \"showdowns\" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

          "description": "Getting your first starter team in EA FC 25's Ultimate Team will always be a special moment.\n\n\nUsually, most players need a few days to build up their clubs with random clubs. With Champions mode about to start soon, it's advisable to target squads that offer full league-based chemistry. With so many official leagues available, there are plenty of choices. It's always preferable to make a squad based on top European leagues, as they tend to receive the bulk of promo items later in the calendar.\n\n\nBefore diving deep, it's best to remember a few points - these are starter teams.

          "description": "Despite its classification as a Normal type, Eevee's versatility extends far beyond the norm with its diverse array of forms. Each variant presents unique perks that can give you the edge you need in battle. Here's the best Eevee evolution in Pokémon Go to narrow down your choice.\n\n\nWhat is the best Eevee evolution in Pokémon Go?\n\n\nWith everyone having their own distinct playstyle, choosing one clear choice can be a challenge. However, when you consider the entire collection, Umbreon and Sylveon emerge as the best all-around Eevee evolutions in Pokémon Go. Umbreon's excellence in Ultra or Great Leagues and Sylveon's success in Master League/Raids make them adaptable options. It all depends on your needs, but you can always opt for another one if PvP isn't your focus.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nUmbreon covers a lot of bases as a Dark Type, standing against Fighting, Bug, and Fairies. The Pokémon also offers a variety of powerful movesets, including Foul Play, Snarl, and Dark Pulse. If you have yet to obtain this creature, you can do so by renaming your Eevee to 'Tamao' before evolving it or by walking it for 10 km as your Buddy.\n\n\nIf you're more of a Raid and Master League trainer, go for Sylveon to utilize its Fairy attacks. Movesets like Charm, Moonblast, and Psyshock are effective in these tournaments, catering to offensive and defensive strategies. You'll unlock Sylveon once you rename your Eevee to Kira or earn 70 hearts with it as your Buddy.\n\n\nRegardless of whether Sylveon and Umbreon are considered the best in Pokémon Go, you can still try out the rest of the Eevee evolutions. Pokémon such as Vaporeon and Glaceon can be pretty good with specific Types, or you can pick one based on their appearance. Though, even that might prove difficult since they're all pretty adorable.\n\nThe post The best Eevee evolution in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Zenless Zone Zero's Camellia Golden Week brought the first event exclusive W-Engine in Gilded Blossom, which could also be fully enhanced during it. But is the engine capable of putting up a fight against the game's F2P favorites? And if so, which agents can make better use of it? \n\n\nTo help you pair your new addition with the best agents for the job, here are the best characters for the Gilded Blossom W-Engine in Zenless Zone Zero. \n\n\nThe best characters for the Gilded Blossom W-Engine in ZZZ\n\n\nAlthough not the top A-Rank pick for any agent in ZZZ due to its lack of a CRIT substat and the existence of tailor-made signature W-Engines, Gilded Blossom is the best A-Rank F2P alternative for Corin, whose multi-hit Special and EX Special reliance benefit greatly from its 24% EX Special DMG buff (at five stars). \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nTo add to the above, if paired with at least a 50% CRIT Rate, the fully enhanced engine can even take Cannon Rotor's spot as her best non-signature A-Ranker. If you are not a Corin-main, its all-rounder approach also allows the engine to be a great fit for all of the game's S-Rank DPSs, as well as be the best F2P pick for most of them if you don't have other engines at five stars. \n\n\nShould you pick Gilded Blossom over Starlight Engine?\n\n\nFor all characters but Corin, using a five-star Starlight Engine will provide better results than a fully enhanced Gilded Blossom. The reason for that lies in how, although both will feature the same 594 base and 25% ATK substat at level 60, the former's 19.2% ATK boost will be way more valuable for the game's remaining attackers, who have in their Basic Attacks their biggest sources of damage. \n\n\nNow that you know who are the best characters for the Gilded Blossom W-Engine, don't forget to also check out how to get all videotapes in Zenless Zone Zero so that you can make sure you have your agent's favorites in stock. \n\nThe post Best characters for the Gilded Blossom W-Engine in Zenless Zone Zero appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're playing as a different player, pressing these buttons in the pattern we've mentioned above will perform the Eye of the Storm celebration instead.\n\n\nYou can perform more celebration moves using the L1 and RS buttons on your controller. Take a look at all the finishing move celebrations in EA FC 25 for more festive options. \n\n\nIf you have managed to snag Bellingham in-game, he would significantly improve your team's stats considering he's rated 90 this year. Being an England star playing in La Liga, he can link up with many players to improve team chemistry.\n\n\nPair him with a Vini Jr or Mbappe, and the experience can be much better.

They can also occasionally show up in blue fishing spots, but this is not as common.

While it's as easy as pressing a few buttons, knowing exactly which ones to press is where the challenge lies.\n\n\nHow to take clothes and accessories off in Dress to Impress\n\n\nTaking off clothes and accessories in Dress to Impress involves pressing the portrait button on the right side of your screen and selecting the X icons for anything you wish to remove. In this menu, you'll see all of your clothes, accessories, and hair currently equipped, allowing you to remove any you'd like instantly. You can also tap on each item to change its colors and patterns if you just want to tweak them slightly.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlternatively, if you want to change or remove your hairstyle, you can do this right at the salon. While you're selecting a hairstyle, press the X under your current hair to get rid of it and try out some new options. Although it's easier to do it from the Portrait menu if you're out of the salon, this gives you another method if you're still there and need a quick change.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBe careful as you're taking off clothes or accessories. Dress to Impress doesn't ask for confirmation, so once you press that X button, the item is gone until you equip it again.

          "description": "If you want to acquire a treasure trove of role-playing games while helping others play too, you're in luck. Available on Itch.io right now is the TTRPGs for Accessible Gaming Charity bundle, featuring just over 300 tabletop role-playing games from 139 different game designers. \n\n\nOrganized by ChariTTRPGs creator Jes Wade, the bundle is a fundraising effort for the DOTS RPG Project. The mission of DOTS is to make gaming at the table more accessible for those who are blind and visually impaired. \"While digital dice rollers may be an option,\" the bundle page reads, \"they lack the tactile experience and immersion of physically rolling dice.\" Hoping to bring that tactile experience to those who need it, DOTS has been testing their own dice, the Signature Braille RPG Dice.\n\n\nimage via DOTS RPG Project\n\n\nTo create the Braille RPG Dice, DOTS has been working with well-known dice maker Die Hard Dice to test and prototype their sets. Work on the dice has been ongoing since 2018, but now the dice are ready to be mass produced and shipped to retail locations. That is where the bundle enters the picture. \n\n\nThe goal of the bundle is to raise $20,000, the initial funds needed for production of the dice after which, according to Wade, the production model would become self-sustaining. To achieve this goal, many incredible indie TTRPGs have been brought together, including Runecairn Wardensaga, Eldritch Care Unit, Atomic-Powered Mutant Grrls, Teenagers With Attitude, and many more. \n\n\nFor more information on the details of how each die in the Signature Braille RPG Dice set is made, you can check out their announcement post on Rascal. If you're interested in supporting the DOTS RPG Project, more information on how you can is available on the bundle sale page. The TTRPGs for Accessible Gaming Charity bundle runs until October 20.\n\nThe post This TTRPG charity bundle is raising funds for braille dice appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Originally released a little over a year ago, Blasphemous II is a great example of how to do a sequel right. Now we're about to get more of said sequel with the news that the Mea Culpa DLC is due out on October 31, 2024.\n\n\nThere's more on the way beyond the paid DLC. The Game Kitchen is also cooking up a free update, \"True Torment,\" for release at the same time. Here's a very quick tease for Mea Culpa. The DLC will be priced at $11.99 when it drops on Halloween and discounted at 20 percent off for the first two weeks. \n\n\n\n\nThe DLC's title refers to the lost sword The Penitent One wielded in the first Blasphemous, which launched five years ago this month. The sequel's new expansion adds in two new areas — each with new bosses — four new quests, and a new alternate ending.\n\n\nThere's a lot going on in the free update, too. True Torment introduces New Game Plus, as well as more enemies, abilities, prayers, and updated quality-of-life and accessibility features. One of the new challenges is the Labyrinth of Tides, the name of which is suitably mysterious and foreboding now but comes dangerously close to sounding like the Blasphemous equivalent of a water temple. \n\n\nIt's been long enough since Blasphemous II came out that dealing with these new challenges might just necessitate a fresh start. You'll soon find me trudging through Cvstodia once again with hell in my eyes.\n\nThe post Blasphemous II commits further sins on Halloween in Mea Culpa DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the release of Update 0.5 for Anime Vanguards, titled the Slayer's Corp update, a brand-new secret called Renguku was added. Rengoku and his evolved form, Renguku (Purgatory) are extremely powerful and worthwhile to farm for. Here is how to get Rengoku in Anime Vanguards with Update 0.5.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get Renguku\n\n\nThe new Rengoku Secret Unit in Anime Vanguards can only be obtained by completing the first Raid, more specifically Spider Forest Act 4. In order to unlock the new Raids in Anime Vanguards you must first complete every Act from the Story Mode across all three maps.\n\n\nWith Raids unlocked, you'll need to be Acts 1-3 of the Spider Forest Raid in order to unlock Act 4. Each time you complete the Spider Forest Act 4 Raid map you will have a 1% chance of acquiring the new Renguko Secret Unit.\n\n\nHowever, with the Slayer's Corp update, there's a way to increase your chances of getting Renguko even further. As you complete the Raids you will get a new type of currency called Red Web. You can turn in 400 of these Red Webs at the Raid Shop vendor for a Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item, that increases the drop chance of all Secret units, including Renguko. If you're impatient, you can also purchase this item for $199 Robux.\n\n\nHow to evolve into Renguku (Purgatory)\n\n\nEven though Renguko is powerful on his own, his evolved Purgatory form is even stronger. In his Renguku (Purgatory) Evolved form, the unit gains a secondary ability called Unwavering Focus. This ability increases damage by 5% for each consecutive attack on the same enemy, stacking up to four times, for a maximum of 20%.\n\n\nYou can evolve Renguku into Renguku (Purgatory) by acquiring the following materials and visiting the Evolve NPC:\n\n\n\n1x Slayer's Cape (Purchased for 600 Red Webs at the Raid Shop)\n\n\n40x Green Essence Stone\n\n\n14x Yellow Essence Stone\n\n\n14x Red Essence Stone\n\n\n13x Pink Essence Stone\n\n\n4x Rainbow Essence Stone\n\n\n15,000 Gold\n\n\nThe post How to get Renguko in Anime Vanguards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Releasing in 2006, it was at a time when people were just getting acquainted with the Xbox 360 and the new generation of hardware. Games released in that window often get a bump, both critically and sales-wise.\n\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I have a massive soft spot for the original Dead Rising, partially because I played it during the 360’s honeymoon period. It was a convincing display of what would be possible in the new console generation with its hordes of zombies. However, I had my frustrations with it. Enough that my attempts to return to it years later never went very far. Well, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster addresses almost all of those complaints.\n\n\n\n\n\nDead Rising Deluxe Remaster (PC [Reviewed],…",

          "description": "The first season of My Happy Marriage was an instant hit when it was released on Netflix back in July 2023, quickly working its way into the hearts of viewers. It’s an incredibly touching story, and the anime is coming back for a second season in January 2025. \n\n\n\n\nThere’s something special about watching someone realize their worth when they’ve been downtrodden their entire life, thanks to mistreatment from others. It’s something that I can heavily relate to myself, and I know a lot of others can likely say the same. My Happy Marriage takes this concept up a notch. \n\n\nSeason one of My Happy Marriage saw Miyo, a girl who thought that she wasn’t worthy of love, betrothed to the somewhat grumpy and hard-shelled Kiyoka, whose previous fiancées had fled within three days of meeting him. Over the course of the season, we saw her determination slowly win over his heart and, eventually, love blossomed. \n\n\nOf course, there were plenty of trials and tribulations faced by the couple, but there will likely be more to come in the second season. Miyo, with her Dream-Sight ability, will come face to face with Kiyoka’s mother for the first time, something which apparently doesn’t go smoothly judging from the teaser released by Netflix. \n\n\nHere's a teaser from the press release: \"In the second season, the battle over the 'blood of the Usuba' that flows through Miyo enters a new phase, with their love put to the test. Will these two be able to fully protect the happiness they have finally grasped in their hands?\"\n\n\nI have complete faith in the pair's love and dedication to each other, and I fully believe that together they can get through anything, but it’s sure to be a bumpy ride. Episodes will be released weekly, so there’s going to be some nail-biting time between installments as we wait to see what happens. \n\nThe post My Happy Marriage season 2 is coming to Netflix in January 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're unaware, Dailies do reset at a specific time, and knowing when will make the process less tedious to deal with.\n\n\nHow often do Dailies reset in WoW: The War Within?\n\n\nTimezones can make the Daily reset time difficult to match up, but every WoW server has a universal 'Server Time' to make it easier to comprehend. This 'Server Time' usually matches up with your local time. \n\n\nWith that in mind, Daily Resets occur at 8:00 PM PDT for NA servers and 9:00 PM PDT for EU servers. If you've been running Bountiful Delves or have daily craft limits on professions, then the above times are when these activities reset back to their base level and can be completed again. Additionally, one of the four zones in The War Within will have golden orbs spawn in the air daily. These will also reset at the above times, but change to a different zone each time.\n\n\nWhen do Weeklies reset in WoW: The War Within?\n\n\nSimilar to Dailies, Weeklies reset at 8:00 PM PDT for NA, and 9:00 PM PDT for EU, every Tuesday. Weeklies include major zone-wide events such as Awaken the Machine and the Lamplighter quest hub (Spreading the Light). \n\n\nAdditionally, all main versions of the current raid, Nerub-ar Palace, reset at the above-mentioned times. Note that LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic versions of the raid will reset at these times, but all four difficulties have separate lock-outs and can be run weekly. The only version of the raid that will not reset (because there is no lock-out) is the Story Mode version. This is because there is no loot to be earned in Story Mode, and thus, can be run as often as you like.\n\nThe post When do Dailies reset in WoW: The War Within? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The presentation will be streamed on both YouTube and Twitch and will feature more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR 2 titles from studios all over the world.\n\n\nThe last State of Play occurred in May of this year and focused primarily on the ill-fated Concord, taking up over 10 minutes of the roughly half-hour presentation. As for what to expect with this State of Play, Sony hasn't confirmed anything specific but has mentioned over 20 titles will be front and center. It's highly likely we'll see Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered officially announced, and there have been rumors of other PlayStation title remasters in the works.\n\n\nSurely any remastered announcements will attempt to show off the newly announced PlayStation 5 Pro, and I imagine we'll see a 'Enhanced for PS5 Pro' or similar moniker after most of the reveals. You know, marketing stuff.\n\n\nHowever, it's always possible that Sony has kept a top-secret new IP or popular IP game announcement that hasn't leaked yet. It feels like as good a time of ever for Sony to have an ace up their sleeve, after all.\n\n\nBut if the State of Play is bound to be packed full of remasters, wake me up when Bloodborne Remastered drops.\n\n\nThe upcoming PlayStation State of Play starts at 6 pm EST tomorrow, September 24, and will be live on both YouTube and Twitch.\n\nThe post State of Play set for September 24, featuring over 20 upcoming titles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Among the mid-tier resources players can encounter in LEGO Fortnite, very few are more vital than Obsidian. The material is a requirement for building must-haves like the Metal Smelter, Epic Pickaxe, Oven, and a few other handy items. \n\n\nBut as the material can only be found in very specific locations, getting your hands on it can prove to be a challenge. To help you with that, here's how to get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite. \n\n\nWhere to find and how to get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite\n\n\nYou can get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite by mainly mining it from Lava Caves, which can be spotted exclusively across the Dry Lands biome. Once inside any of the caves, you will be able to easily spot the obsidian rocks by their deep purple color and mine them by using a Rare or above Pickaxe. If you have yet to get the item, the Rare Pickaxe can be crafted by expending three Flexwood Rods and three Sand Claws. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nMake sure to keep in mind that the lava caves are extremely hot environments that will slowly drain your health even while carrying multiple Cool-Headed Charms. To minimize that and get an extra layer of protection, I highly recommend that you also bring a few Snowberries and Snowberry Shakes for the expedition. You can check out how to make both the heat-resisting charm and the shake below:\n\n\n\nCool-Headed Charm (Uncommon): By expending 3x Silk Thread, 1x Marble, and 3x Sand Shells.\n\n\nSnowberry Shake: By expending 2x Snowberry and 1x Milk. Can only be made with a Juicer. You can find Snowberries in bushes all around the Frostlands and get Milk by petting cows.  \n\n\n\nNow that you know how to get Obsidian, don't forget to also check out how to craft a Musket, a Flintlock Pistol, and a Cannon in LEGO Fortnite.\n\nThe post How to get Obsidian in LEGO Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has released an interview with The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom staff Eiji Aonuma, Tomomi Sano, Satoshi Terada that gives some behind-the-scenes background to the development of the game. Among the tidbits of information is the fact that the game once took a very different form.\n\n\nSpecifically, Echoes of Wisdom began with a “Game with dungeon creation in mind,” according to Aonuma. However, from there, it quickly changed to an “edit dungeon” format. In this concept, Link could change the perspective or move objects to “edit” the dungeon and solve puzzles. A lot of this still made it into the final version in the form of the eponymous echoes that Zelda can create. \n\n\nHowever, from the sound of things, Grezzo was aiming for something closer to the “Zelda Maker” concept, but it was dropped for the “edit dungeon” format, which was then scaled back to the game it is now. In particular, this quote from Sano really sums up the evolution:\n\n\n\n“Of course, creating dungeons was fun, but being able to copy various objects and use them in different places was even more fun.”\nTomomi Sano\n\n\n\nI could get behind a Zelda dungeon maker. In fact, it would probably be good for me; expanding the way I think about the series’ design in the same way that Mario Maker did. I think it’s possible that Nintendo will do it one day, even if the current attempt at this mutated into Echoes of Wisdom. There is certainly enough demand for the concept.\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is out on September 26, 2024 for Switch. You can read the full interview over here on Nintendo’s site.\n\nThe post Echoes of Wisdom was first prototyped as a Zelda dungeon maker appeared first on Destructoid.",

Výborní herci, výborná atmosféra jednotlivých scén, ale velmi brzy jsem se přestal snažit chápat, co si z toho mám vlastně odnést. Mírným pozitivem je, že to jsou tři oddělené minipříběhy (se stejnými herci) a ne jeden dlouhý. (Ilča 60 %)",

          "description": "Surrealistický artfilm, který by byl možná originální před 70 lety a zajímavě retro před 30 lety, ale dnes je především nudný a nemá k ničemu co říct. Je chvályhodné, pokud tento film pomůže zlepšit podmínky v dětských domovech, ale bez hromady doprovodných informací není ani zřejmé, že má mít nějaký takový účel. Z toho, co se děje na plátně, nevyplývá nic víc než \"Podívejte, co se honí v mé šílené hlavě, zajímá vás to?\" Mě osobně ne. (Ilča 20 %)",
