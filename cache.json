          "description": "And takes a look at what the console might be able to run.\nRumours of Nintendo's next console — the one that we are still preliminarily referring to as the 'Switch 2' — have continued to come thick and fast this year and, if they are to be believed, all signs are pointing towards an announcement and release in 2024. Many of these rumours are built on hearsay, but the tech experts over at Digital Foundry have been digging into something more concrete: the chip that it is believed sits at the heart of the Switch successor.\nOf course, none of this is official for the moment (the amount of official 'Switch 2' news out there wouldn't fill the back of a postage stamp), but Digital Foundry states that the chip in question, dubbed Nvidia's T239, is almost certainly tied to a Nintendo project due to how it continues to support the \"console-specific graphics API\" that was used on the original Switch's Tegra chip. In short, it's all rather interesting.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "(Bah, hum)bugs abound.\nOf the hundreds of versions of A Christmas Carol that we’re all bombarded with in the lead-up to the Holidays, very few give any thought to what comes after Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. The focus is firmly on how he becomes a changed man and not what he actually does with his newfound joy and Christmas spirit. Ebenezer and the Invisible World makes the bold proposition that Scrooge would become a ghost-thrashing, high-jumping champion of the common people and we're here for it.\nSet several years after the events of Dickens’ novel, Ebenezer and The Invisible World sees the miser-turned-saint as something of a bridge between the spirit and the material worlds. His encounter with the Ghosts of Christmas left him able to see the souls of those who could not cast off their chains of misery and cruelty as he has, leaving him the only one capable of aiding them on their quest for peace. It is a fun play on the original story we know so well and it immediately drew us in.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.\r\n\n\r\nOver the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.\r\n\nI headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?\r\n\n \nRead more",

In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. \nChunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.\nRead more",

          "description": "Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.\r\n\n\r\nBut such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left.

It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.\nUsing a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.\nRead more",

          "description": "What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. \r\n\nYet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. \nAlan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.\nRead more",

The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.\nRead more",

Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly?

I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.\nIn contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.\nRead more",

Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And yet! That's a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-'em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It's a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you're a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it's rather sweet. Cosy, even.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. \r\n\n\r\nI played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a \"sleeping old one below\". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.\r\n\n \nRead more",

These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing \"good progress\", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.\nFurther afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known.

          "description": "Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. \nNow, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual \"next-gen\" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: \"I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do.\" \nRead more",

No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.\nBut dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards.

For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.\nRead more",

The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience.

Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. \nHappily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, \"Objection!\" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend. \nRead more",

He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.\r\n\n\r\nA widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this \"bizarre story.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to \"look at the image quality\" instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.\nActually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.\nRead more",

Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0's enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.\nRemedy's plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka \"Final Draft\", which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake's fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves \"an independent government organization\" that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it's now due to make landfall in the publisher's FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What's the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for \"vapourware\"? I'm picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.\r\n\n\r\nThe troubled naval combat sim isn't the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious \"large game\", originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As part of the update, “Adventures” mode is coming, giving some story to chew on.\n\n\nThat might be stretching it somewhat. The Adventures are remixes of content already in the game.

Honestly, trying to envision Vampire Survivors with any sort of dialogue doesn’t work for me. Then, going further and imagining it with voice acting makes me want to retch. Low budget is basically its aesthetic. It looks like a bootleg Castlevania, and really works it as an identity.\n\n\nThe Adventures mode is free, and while there will only be a few chapters at first, more will keep getting added along the way. Vampire Survivors’ 1.8 patch will also include the usuals, including new “characters, weapons, and stages.”\n\n\nThere’s no date on Vampire Survivors 1.8. However, the FAQ says that it will launch “soon” for all platforms.\n\nThe post Vampire Survivors patch 1.8 is bringing a “narrative” Adventures mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Haha, what? Ziggurat Interactive has announced that they have teamed up with Big Boat to re-release 2005’s incredible kusoge, Boiling Point: Road to Hell on November 14, 2023.\n\n\nThis game and I have history. Back when it released, everyone was looking to what the next generation in graphics would bring to the open-world genre. Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was still on the horizon with its big promises, but we needed something now. So, my tightly-knit group of friends and I started poking at Boiling Point: Road to Hell in the interim. Its world was advertised at 25x25km.\n\n\nWhen Boiling Point first launched, it was buggy beyond reason. I’m pretty sure I tapped out earlier, as I didn’t yet have my constitution for bad games. However, at least one of my friends pushed a lot deeper into it. I don’t think he completed it.\n\n\n\n\nThey’d later patch the game, at which point it (maybe) gained a few fans. I tried it again at that point, and I remember getting into the open world before abruptly losing interest. I distinctly remember being in the middle of the jungle and thinking, “yeah, no.”\n\n\nThe game is about Saul Myers, whose daughter was kidnapped in Realia, a fictional (heh) South American Country that, if I recall, is under the thumb of organized crime and corrupt politicians. As mentioned, it’s an open-world game in an impractically massive environment. Big Boat is making “major improvements to the game’s stability” to Boiling Point to make this the definitive version. No widescreen, though?\n\n\nThis is amazing news. I’m not even being sarcastic. I’m going to have to find time to play this again. Maybe with my time-embiggened gamer brain, I can actually get through it.\n\n\nBrace yourself because Boiling Point: Road to Hell is being re-released on November 14, 2023 on GOG and Steam.\n\nThe post 2005’s open-world mess Boiling Point gets a re-release on November 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In the wake of devastating layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie, the studio has said this week has been “one of the most difficult weeks” in the studio’s history. To move forward, it is now committed to making the upcoming Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion one of “the best games we’ve ever made.” \n\n\n“We know we have lost a lot of your trust,” the Destiny 2 development team wrote in a blog post. “Destiny needs to surprise and delight. We haven’t done this enough and that’s going to change.”\n\n\nTo start, the studio says it has “more than 650 dedicated teammates pouring all their energy and expertise into delivering” The Final Shape, in addition to the Episodes that will follow. Bungie says fans can expect to hear more about the future of Destiny 2 “in the weeks ahead.”\n\n\nIn the latest example of a long line of games industry layoffs, Bungie laid off an estimated 100 employees according to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier in late October. Schreier also reports The Final Shape will see a delay, as well as Marathon.\n\n\nThis instance is simply the latest in a long string of layoffs and shutdowns in the games industry. Other studios that have experienced layoffs include Epic Games, CD Projekt Red, Naughty Dog, Twitch, and Ubisoft, among many, many others. Studios that have been shut down include Volition Games, Dang!, Vanpool, and PixelOpus.\n\nThe post Bungie to Destiny 2 players: “We know we have lost a lot of your trust” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1 has a hell of a DLC lineup on the way. Today's Omni-Man gameplay trailer showcases why he may just be the most badass of the bunch when he arrives this month.\n\n\nJust as in the Invincible animated Amazon series, Omni-Man is voiced by the ridiculously awesome J.K. Simmons. Throughout the trailer, NetherRealm Studios shows off the actor's skills as he relentlessly mocks Liu Kang and his allies prior to beating the hell out of them. \n\n\n\n\nWe've seen what Omni-Man is capable of in a previous Mortal Kombat 1 trailer. But today's video puts the Viltrumite's full abilities on display. He's brutal, nimble, and of course, deadly. You don't need a subway train to showcase that. \n\n\nA new kameo fighter is also on the way alongside Omni-Man's debut next week. Tremor, who originally debuted in 2000's Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, is a ninja like Sub-Zero and Scorpion but with earth powers. He pairs nicely as a kameo higher alongside Omni-Man. While the Invincible villain is pulling meteors from the atmosphere and smashing opponents with them, Tremor is doing the same with giant boulders right here from Earth. \n\n\nBoth combatants will join the fray on November 9 for those with the Kombat Pack. They are available a week later for everyone else as standalone DLC.\n\n\nFollowing that, there's plenty more DLC in the pipeline. Quan-Chi and DC's Peacemaker are slated for sometime in the winter. Ermac and The Boys' Homelander are planned for spring. The apprentice of Scorpion himself, Takeda Takahashi, should be out as a playable fighter next summer. And Ferra, Janet Cage, Khameleon, and Mavado are all in the works as additional kameo fighters. \n\n\nIf you haven't given Mortal Kombat 1 a try, perhaps you should. In Destructoid's review, we thought it was great. \n\nThe post Omni-Man joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on November 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

For a limited time only, Twitch is offering viewers a free trial of Crunchyroll, the hit animation streaming service, for your viewing pleasure. \n\n\nAs outlined in a recent Twitch blog post, the Amazon-owned platform is providing a 60-day trial of Crunchyroll Mega Fan Premium membership. This means you'll get to watch all your favorite anime and manga shows without ads.\n\n\nImage via Twitch.\n\n\nOf course, it's not as simple as just holding out your hand and waiting for the trial to drop into it. There are a few provisos before you can qualify. Because of course there are.\n\n\n*Sigh* Okay, what do I have to do?\n\n\nFor starters, the campaign is only being run for this month, so you have until November 30 to get your free trial. In exchange for the Crunchyroll membership, you'll need to purchase \"two new Twitch subs and/or gift subs.\"\n\n\nThe type of Twitch subscriptions and gifted subs that are eligible include:\n\n\n\nNew monthly subs (any tier)\n\n\nMulti-month subs (3-month, 6-month)\n\n\nGift subs (any tier for any number of months)\n\n\n\nPrime subs, existing sub renewals, bits, turbos, and a bunch of others don't qualify.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that it's only available on \"participating channels streaming in the Just Chatting, Art, and One Punch Man: World categories.\" You also can't qualify for the offer if you live in any of the following countries:\n\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nUkraine\n\n\nCuba\n\n\nChina\n\n\nIran\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nSyria\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n\n\nSudan\n\n\n\nWhat else? Oh, yeah: \"existing or past Crunchyroll members or users who have previously claimed a Crunchyroll free trial in the past year are not eligible.\"\n\n\nI think that covers everything. As is typical with these types of deals, there are plenty of Ts & Cs before you qualify. If you do quality, happy days. If not...

While there's still some time until we can expect a proper release date, the team behind the ambitious Oblivion remake has released a hair-raising video update.\n\n\nOver on YouTube, the unofficial fan remake of TES4 lets its cape down to bring a more sinister vibe in promoting Skyblivion. The video showcases some of the darker and scarier elements of this Oblivion reimagining.\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, we get a glimpse of some areas that have been given a new spit shine in Skyrim's engine, including Hackdirt and Arkved’s Tower. We also get a look at some new monsters that have been made specifically for this project. There's even a quest walkthrough, as well.\n\n\nWhen is it coming out?\n\n\nAt the moment, there's no definite release window for Skyblivion yet, outside a likely 2025 launch. It is, after all, quite the undertaking, completely reimagining Oblivion in Skyrim's engine. Volunteers are always welcome as well, if you do want to lend a hand.\n\n\nWe've seen in the past that the remake is coming along nicely, and with each update we get, we move closer to the project becoming available.\n\n\nHaving started back in 2012, the fan remake has been in development for over 13 years at this point. However, it's looking more and more like it's going to be worth it in the end. You'll also be pleased to know that it'll be completely free, providing you have legitimate copies of Oblivion and Skyrim (natch).\n\nThe post Oblivion fan remake Skyblivion shows off new, spooky footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Larian Studios has pushed through a massive Patch 4 to Baldur’s Gate 3, applying over 1000 fixes, tweaks and changes. Accessibility is a major focus of this patch, in addition to other fixes applied to the hirelings system, combat, and UI.\n\n\nTo start, the team has implemented a setting that allows color-blind players to choose between protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia, which applies to character outlines, circles, character map markers, frame portraits in turn order, and party portraits. For those unfamiliar, protanopia and deuteranopia corresponds to red-green color vision deficiency, while tritanopia is blue-yellow.\n\n\nIn addition, the appearance of hirelings can now be customized when recruiting them. Also, dead avatars can be sent to Withers’ Wardrobe of Wayward Friends, and the enigmatic skeleton will explain how the feature works for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay, several autosaves have been added to the Shadowlands, Wyrm’s Crossing, and the Lower City, including at the Steel Watch Foundry, the Iron Throne, and Rivington. There is now an option to make the ‘end turn’ button need to be held rather than tapped, for those of us who needed that.\n\n\nI think one of the fixes I’m the least happy about is in the fight with a certain boss in Act 3. It’d seem you can no longer push him into a chasm, because apparently logic kicks in and he remembers he has a natural defense to sudden gravitational shifts.\n\n\nAlso, one of the most important things in Act 3 has been corrected — Yenna now returns to camp after the avatar of Bhaal kidnaps one of your friends instead of inexplicably disappearing. I always wondered about where she went, but it made such a minimal impact on my campaign that I just shrugged it off.\n\n\nTo read up on every single change made in Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 4, click here. \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 4 is live, with accessibility and hireling updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The 2002 PS2 title, Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 has received a fan translation. Surprisingly, this came out before an anticipated fan translation of the original PS1 game.\n\n\nPreviously, Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 was only released in Japan on PS2 (later ported to PSP). For that matter, the entire series never really left Japan. Part of the sudden rush is due to more Western awareness of the titles, especially in the wake of Action Button’s six-hour review on the title. It’s really hard to write that out without adding an expletive. Let’s just say I don’t have the attention span to watch it.\n\n\nI also often joke that, because Boku no Natsuyasumi is popular, I probably wouldn’t like it. In all honesty, it’s probably directly up my alley. The title translates pretty directly to “My Summer Vacation,” but …",

Although the sign isn’t super flashy or extravagant, it still looks crisp and welcoming for future fans to admire while paying a visit to the historical site.\n\n\nDuring a Direct in September, the gaming giant teased fans with the museum. In the Instagram post that Nintendo Japan posted on October 26, the sign and logo can be seen from a number of different perspectives, showing off the sign from different times of the day.\n\n\nCurrently, the museum is under construction in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, near Kyoto, Japan. The renovations and construction work are set to be completed in March 2024. The sole purpose of the long-awaited project is to provide fans with a glimpse of the company’s legacy, history, and highlights through a well-laid-out collection of its past.\n\n\nHistory of the Nintendo Museum Site\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nBack in 2021, Nintendo announced the renovation of one of their old facilities, its Uji Ogura Plant. First built in 1969, the plant’s original purpose was to produce playing cards and Hanafuda cards. Later on, the plant became a customer service hub, for the company’s products to be repaired. \n\n\nThe renovations announced include both the plant and the land surrounding it. Originally, this project was planned to be called the Nintendo Gallery with a similar concept and approach to its current museum idea.\n\n\nWe'll hopefully see more than just a sign in the months to come, leading up to the Nintendo Museum's opening.\n\nThe post The Nintendo Museum’s sign and logo have been revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go?

Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!\nImpressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a \"talk\" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.\nDonkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled \"Guerilla\", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.\nPurchase",

Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. \nThe trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nOmni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon on Hot Ones. \nAre you excited for Omni-Man in Mortal Kombat 1?

That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. \n\n\nMore specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. \nPokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk launches on December 14!\n#PokemonScarletViolet ❤️💜 pic.twitter.com/IljDHdTUeq\nNovember 2, 2023\nMany players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. \nPokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. \nFor more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review. \nAre you hopping into The Indigo Disk next month?

It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. \nThe Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents \"blackened by a language he innately understands.\" \n\"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,\" a press release reads. \"An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?\"\nUbisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. \nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1.

This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. \n\n\nWith Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer \"whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters,\" according to a new statement released. \nYou can read Fox's full statement below: \nElsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, \"I already feel very confident about how we can progress.\" They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. \nFor more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser.

Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. \nIn the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. \nCheck out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSquare Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.\nKingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. \nFor more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes\nWhen host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.\nYou can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). \n\n\nWhether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.\nBeyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5.

Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. \nThis pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as \"Monster Baby\". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.\n\n\nUnlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "In the last year or so, it seems Apple has come to realize the devices it is putting in everyone's pockets are actually quite powerful and can do a whole lot more than just browse the internet and send text messages. Playing video games on a phone is familiar practice, but with the release of iPhone 15, Apple is making a push to compete with the likes of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. This is why games like Death Stranding and Resident Evil Village are making their way to the newest iOS device, the latter of which releases October 30.\nIn honor of that looming release, Marcus joined me for a look at the game on this new platform. It's difficult to show exactly what Resident Evil Village looks on iPhone 15. The screen looks sharper and the framerate is higher than I am able to capture, but we do our best to offer at least a small taste. To ruin the thesis of the video a bit, the conclusion is that Resident Evil Village on iPhone 15 looks good and plays well! As long as you are playing with a controller. The touch-controls render the game nearly unplayable. The U.I. is supremely distracting and Resident Evil Village was not built with the touch controls in mind, and it shows. But if you have a Backbone controller or a Bluetooth controller (like a PS4 or PS5 controller) than you will be in good shape to fight werewolves and Lady Dimitrescu on a handheld platform.\nFollow the link for Game Informer's Resident Evil Village review.

But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.\nStrangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.\n#TheBatman suit is available for #ArkhamKnight via the Epic Games store\n@Venturian628) pic.twitter.com/pdTMYoNvWe\nOctober 26, 2023\nAt first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added.

Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. \nThe Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. \nWhile we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight.

A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. \n\n\nVersion 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: \nAddressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed\nAddressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions\nAddressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright\nImproved stability\nDeveloper Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. \n\"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,\" it reads. \"We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error.

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
