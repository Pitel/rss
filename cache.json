Over Annapurna’s brief 5-year history, its preferred flavour of stylish, quirky, thoughtful games has become well-understood, as has the “triple-I” production and publicity push that sets Indie Devs™ apart from other independent developers. Coming from Beethoven & Dinosaur, The Artful Escape's finding-yourself story and guitar-wailing platform gameplay conceit won some lofty praise last year, but can they still impress on Switch in 2022?\nThe answer’s an easy 'yes', but after so much hype, the surprise feels a little fainter and the simplicity of the musical mechanic more transparent. There’s also the expected Switch port caveats to address, as well, about how the console copes with a game that’s made for bigger systems. Nonetheless, the positives far outweigh some minor gripes and those who’ve come to trust Annapurna’s judgment will find they’ve backed another winner.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Despite fierce opposition the Nintendo-distributed game at the top of this scribe's list is Triangle Strategy, which is coming to us thanks to Square Enix and continuing the visual style we first saw in Octopath Traveler. Yes, there are massive Pokémon and Kirby games too, but for fans of strategy games it's hard not to be ever-so-slightly impatient for a title that, to be honest, has a rubbish name.\nTo clarify, though the look and of course the leadership of Square Enix (especially through producer Tomoya Asano) in the projects are the same, Triangle Strategy and Octopath Traveler have different contributing development studios. With Octopath Traveler it was Acquire, whereas for Triangle Strategy it's Artdink. Both companies have a lot of experience and it makes sense that different teams would specialise in very different genres, but it's a reminder that Triangle Strategy is very much its own game and the link with its HD-2D predecessor is largely limited to the rather handsome graphics engine.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).\nCode Force have since sent us a preview build, and I've been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I'm struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it's had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I'm hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.\nRead more",

Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. \nVampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically.

According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War's other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he's doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and \"I know you are, but what am I?\" nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.\nRead more",

Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. \nI say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen's Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. \nI mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I've played since then that's even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won't find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there's no real 'game' to speak of.\nRead more",

Respawn Entertainment always felt like one of those development studios that should have been shut down by a bigger studio circa 2015 because the people loved Titanfall but it wasn't, you know, Call Of Duty or anything. I turned my back for what seemed like but a moment, and suddenly Apex Legends exists and Respawn are one of the key players under EA, growing stronger from within. One day we'll be watching Andrew Wilson at an E3 showcase and realise it's actually Vince Zampella's eyes looking out at us. Everyone coming on stage to present is just Vince Zampella doing a voice and wearing a different baseball cap.\nPoint is, I'm mostly just pleased that Respawn are still around to make games featuring robots that surprise and delight us. And if they're not allowed to do Titanfall 3, Star Wars is at least a rich field to till said robots. Lousy with robots, is Star Wars. But honestly, if anyone is going to make Star Wars games (apart from BioWare, who have spent recent years making Dragon Age 4 and / or collapsing like a magnificent neutron star) then I'd root for Respawn. They may not make the Star Wars games you think you want, but they'll make the ones you need right now.\nRead more",

          "description": "Pupperazzi is a game about taking pictures of dogs. They are, as is traditional, very cute dogs. You go around several areas that increase in complexity and dog saturation, completing photo challenges and unlocking more and more complex areas. An extreme sports dog wants a picture of a dog riding a scooter. The old sea-dog at the beach would like a photo of any dog, as long as the lighthouse is in the background. In return for this you get golden bones as a form of currency to buy different kinds of film, or weird lenses, to kick your photography into the next gear.\nIt's cute. It's a really nice playground that facilitates the player's own creativity. You can pet dogs to make them happy, or find toys to make them do different things: turn on a radio and any furry pals nearby bust out some truly astonishing moves; throw a stick to initiate a huge game of fetch. You post your photos to a kind of dog-centric Instagram for likes and comments (possibly from dogs; possibly from humans). The colourful, chunky art, combined with deliberately stiff animation where nobody can move their joints, really reminds me of Playmobil toys. Despite this carefree, playful tone, I also find it unaccountably sinister.\nRead more",

A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.\r\n\n\nNot For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.\nBetween its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It's needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it's almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can't say for sure how it plays yet, but it's already looking very promising.\nRead more",

Today, we're finally seeing some movement in bringing Discord integration to Sony's consoles, or rather the other way around. \nAs of today, you can now link your PlayStation account to your Discord ID. This lets your friends or other server mutuals see when and what you're playing on PS5 or PS4. The service works like any others, such as Steam, Blizzard, Xbox, Spotify, etc. The setup is the same as well.\nHere's how Discord says to connect a PlayStation account:\n\"To connect your Discord account to your PlayStation Network account, open up Discord and head into User Settings > Connections on either desktop or web. On mobile, go to User Settings > Connections.\" From there, you'll enter your login information for your PlayStation account. Pretty easy. It also notes that you can toggle whether anyone can see your PlayStation status in case you need to keep something hidden for whatever reason.\nThe PlayStation functionality works on any platform Discord is on, so give it a go if you play on Sony's consoles. Unfortunately, there wasn't any update to the broader integration of the two, but this small step is a good start for now. \nIn other Sony news today, the console maker picked up a huge studio with the acquisition of Destiny 2 developer Bungie.

But what does that mean for Destiny fans and the industry at large? Join us on this discussion video as we talk about all of that and so much more.\nAlex Stadnik is here with associate editor Jill Grodt and Magazine Content Director, and huge Bungie fan Matt Miller to break down today's breaking news. We start by discussing the particulars of the deal as we know it now, including how Bungie is maintaining its independence. The studio has said that it still can self-publish and choose where its games can release. The studio's blog post also outlined that the goal is to keep Destiny communities intact and not strip the game away from Xbox users now or in the future. \nWhile we may know the immediate plans for one of the biggest franchises in games, what about the future? Bungie is working on new projects, but will they be exclusive to PlayStation in the future? Bungie has said, in fact, \"We want the worlds we are creating to extend to anywhere people play games. We will continue to be self-published, creatively independent, and we will continue to drive one, unified Bungie community.\" Xbox fans can sleep soundly, at least tonight. \nWe finally round out our video discussion by zooming out to the gaming landscape at large. This is the second impactful industry acquisition in the last month, but how will this change the landscape of games? Will this motivate the streaming giants also to start buying up IP? Is this good for the industry? We answer all those questions and more, and we hope you enjoy our talk.\nEnjoyed this discussion video? We have plenty more over on our YouTube channel.

The news of this deal comes from an exclusive report from Variety. \nOutspoken Hazelight creative director Josef Fares sounds excited for the opportunity to bring It Takes Two to another medium. “Creating the world and story in ‘It Takes Two’ was so much fun for me and the team,” Fares said to Variety. “Since it has a strong narrative with many crazy characters and just as crazy co-op action moments, the potential is huge for a great adaption to film or television.” \ndj2 Entertainment is no stranger to producing adaptations of video games with 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog movie and its sequel, the upcoming Tomb Raider anime series slated to be released on Netflix, and is attached to executive produce projects based on Disco Elysium and Life is Strange. dj2 CEO and founder Dmitri M. Johnson spoke to Variety about the potential project, saying, “dj2 is honored to partner with Josef, Oskar [Wolontis], and the incredible team at Hazelight Studios on the linear media adaptation of ‘It Takes Two.'” He continues, “Just like the rest of the gaming world, we fell head-over-heels in love with Cody, May, Rose, Dr. Hakim and the imaginative fantasy universe Hazelight have created, and can’t wait to bring these characters -and this world- to life on the big and small screen.”\nAccording to Variety, the project doesn't have any studios or networks attached as of yet. However, there does happen to be a \"multi-party bidding war\" ongoing for the rights to the It Takes Two adaptation. \nIt Takes Two saw plenty of critical acclaim last year, and we here at Game Informer are quite fond of it ourselves! Check out our review of It Takes Two and why we ranked it number eight on our top 10 games of the year.",

Final Fantasy VII Remake is an homage to and reimagining of its predecessor's motifs: Eco-activism, classism, atonement, and companionship (among many other important themes). We demonstrate how Remake's plot beats can be reevaluated with the themes of departure and reunion in mind.\nSquare Enix plans to tell Cloud’s extensive story in parts but, because the first entry solely focuses on Midgar, Final Fantasy VII veterans get to experience the original game’s introductory setting and characters in more nuanced ways. The high stakes remain the same: The fallout from the Mako Reactor 1 and 5 bombings, the eventual destruction of the slums, and Sephiroth’s sudden and terrifying return. Our video essay considers these emotional moments and looks to provide other interpretations surrounding Remake’s most important plot motivations.\nThere are many scenes that Square Enix will have to reveal and unpack in upcoming installments, but we’re excited to see what the future holds for Cloud and co.

CDPR says Golden Nekker will be different from previous iterations of its Gwent titles, instead aiming to provide a “captivating single-player experience,” according to IGN. \nBecause it’s a standalone game, players will not need to own other versions of CDPR’s Gwent games to play it. Once you boot up Golden Nekker, you’re all set to play. \n“It’s not another Witcher Tales game, but something different,” Gwent communications head Pawel Burza told IGN. “We’re aiming to provide a captivating single-player experience for players who prefer it over competitive multiplayer Gwent.” \nIf you’re a fan of CDPR’s competitive multiplayer Gwent game, though, don’t fret – development is set to continue on that title at least through 2022, as the studio has released a 2022 roadmap that features new card drops in April, July, October, and December. When Golden Nekker is released, it will be the first CDPR game since the release of Cyberpunk 2077 back in 2020.\nBe sure to check out IGN’s full report about this new Gwent game to see art for some of the cards.

          "description": "PlayStation has announced that it will air a State of Play this week all about Gran Turismo 7. \nThe first State of Play of 2022, this one promises more than 30 minutes of new PlayStation 5 footage of the upcoming Polyphony Digital simulation racing game. It will also feature new details about GT7, which is slated to arrive on PS5 and PlayStation 4 on March 4. \n“The first 2022 State of Play arrives later this week, and we’re all revved up for just over 30 minutes of new PS5 footage and gameplay details for Gran Turismo 7,” a PlayStation Blog post reads. “Watch live February 2 on Twitch or YouTube starting 2 p.m. Pacific/ 5 p.m. Eastern/ 11 p.m. CET.” \nAnd that’s all that PlayStation had to say about the State of Play. Usually, PlayStation will mention that viewers shouldn’t expect this or that, but because it’s being dubbed a GT7 State of Play, there’s probably no reason for the company to give any caution in that regard. Basically, we don’t recommend going in this expecting PlayStation to surprise reveal a game or talk about Horizon Forbidden West in the showcase’s final few minutes. \nThis State of Play will be the first in-depth look at GT7 in a while. It’s been a sure bet that we’ll see a trailer in recent PlayStation first-party showcases but beyond that, not much about GT7 is known. \nWhile waiting to learn more on Wednesday, read about GT7’s original announcement back in 2020 and then check out this GT7 trailer that shows off the game’s detailed customization and photo mode. Watch the latest GT7 trailer, which features a race around Daytona, after that. \nAre you excited for Gran Turismo 7? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "As previously announced, a new trailer for Paramount’s Halo TV series premiered today, giving us an even better look at the much-anticipated adaptation and a premier date. \nThe show starts from the beginning, with Dr. Halsey (played by Natascha McElhon) selling the UNSC on Master Chief’s exceptional combat prowess but, most importantly, his ability to be controlled. But when Chief encounters an ancient artifact, he uncovers a plot that may require him to act independently in a manner that may rub his superiors the wrong way. \nThe new trailer provides the first looks at the Covenant, specifically Elites, who look pretty accurate in the brief clips of them battling Master Chief. We also get a glimpse of the show’s more human-toned (and slightly unsettling) Cortana, who is still voiced by Jen Taylor. The biggest adjustment will be getting used to Chief’s new voice, with actor Pablo Schreiber bringing him to life. Lastly, we found out that Halo premieres exclusively on Paramount + on March 24. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of this new look at Halo?

          "description": "After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer's Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we’re taking a look at the controversial Halo 5: Guardians, widely considered to be the most polarizing entry in the series. \nHalo 5: Guardians launched on the Xbox One on October 27, 2015, and was the tale of two Spartans. The campaign told a dual narrative centered on Master Chief and Jameson Locke, a soldier tasked with apprehending Chief after he goes AWOL to recover a rampant Cortana. Speaking of everyone’s favorite AI, her mission to subjugate the galaxy positions her as the main antagonist. Halo 5’s narrative didn’t universally land with fans and the game overall served as an unintentional poster child of the Xbox One’s flawed philosophy during its early years. How, you might ask? You’ll have to listen to find out.  \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) along with Wirecutter lead editor Arthur Gies (@aegies) as we unpack the history, impact, and lasting legacy of Halo 5: Guardians. \nCheck out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub.

When I went hands-on with the game, all of Limgrave and Stormveil were open to me, including the haunting Weeping Penninsula to the south. But to the north of Stormveil lies another realm, a biome with a completely different aesthetic. Each realm in Elden Ring has its own signature set of creatures, flora, fauna, and more. The big boss of Stormveil, Godrick the Grafted, does not need to be beaten before moving on to the realm to the north, as a mildly hidden mountain path can lead players into this area without ever stepping foot inside the dangerous castle dungeon. \nThis is the home of the magical academy of Raya Lucaria, and instead of the pastoral greens and rolling fields of Limgrave, it is draped in …",

While they don’t always make an explicit appearance, sometimes they’re found as shimmering surprises that delight (and terrify). This is the case during Ludwig’s phase two battle, where he decides to pull out the Moonlight Greatsword and attempt to dunk on the player with some incredibly flashy power moves. In Elden Ring, players will be able to interact with the duplicitous traitor Patches as well as acquire both the Storm Ruler and Moonlight Greatsword. \n“I can confidently say yes, this time. Elden Ring is the sort of game that forgives a massive sense of volume and bulk,” says game director Hidetaka Miyazaki. “And so I felt like I was entitled to include these things this time. So yes, you will find them if you look hard enough.”\nOf course, with Elden Ring being a vast open-world full of secrets and exploration, it’s likely that some of these items will be tucked away and hidden behind mysteries. While we probably won’t be taking down a manta ray Storm King with the Storm Ruler this time around, since Patches will be there, it’s possible that some other pieces of King’s Field and From Software history will be around somewhere. Since we’ve seen multiple dragons as part of this world, it wouldn’t shock me to see something akin to Seath the Scaleless slithering around.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nIn the same conversion with Miyazaki, while we did get to see otherworldly areas like the Roundtable Hold, there won’t be any Painted Worlds in the game as he feels those are specifically a Dark Souls element. However, you can find paintings in the game all over – collectible objects that display a specific location in the world tied to the artist’s soul. While I didn’t get to track any of these locales down during my session, you can be sure that’s one of the first things on my list of things to do with the final game.",

          "description": "If you’ve been paying attention to Sega for the last couple of years, then you likely know that it has been slowly shuttering its massive Japan-based arcade centers. Now, Sega has announced that it is leaving the business of arcades entirely, ending a 50-year era defined by claw machines, fighters, and more. \nThis news comes by way of Destructoid, which translated a statement released by Sega this morning. In it, the company reveals that it intends to sell the remaining 14.9% of shares it holds within its arcade division to another company named Genda Inc., which Destructoid reports is the same company that Sega has been selling its arcade centers to over the last few years. \n“Sega stores across the country will be switching their store names to GiGO, to express our gratitude for Sega’s 56 years of history and our desire to be an oasis that quenches people’s thirst for real entertainment,” Genda chairman Hisashi Kataoka said in regards to the news, according to Video Games Chronicle. “We will start with Ikebukuro, Akihabara, and Shinjuku. Then to the whole country.” \nThe Sega branding on standing arcade centers will begin to be replaced by GiGO Entertainment branding. While Sega is leaving the business of owning and running arcade centers, don’t expect to see Sega arcade machines disappear. Destructoid reports that Sega still intends to produce arcade machines for worldwide distribution – you just won’t see them inside a large building with a massive Sega sign on it anymore. \nOf course, Sega is still in the business of making games, too, and this year, we’re expecting a new game starring everyone’s favorite blue blur in Sonic Frontiers. Check out the latest Sonic Frontiers trailer for a look at its open world and then read about how Sonic Frontiers was originally going to release in 2021 for the series’ 30th anniversary. \n[Source: Destructoid]\nDo you have a favorite Sega arcade game?

Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out on the Nintendo Switch, and we're celebrating by playing it live on stream starting at 12 p.m. CT only on Twitch! Join John Carson and Alex Stadnik as they traverse the realm of Hisui and show off all the new additions to the iconic series.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nWith Legends, Game Freak has taken the most significant series leap in quite some time, but did the risk pay off? Our own Brian Shea seems to think so. In his review, he said:\nCatching as many Pokémon as you can, learning more about them, and training them to be stronger in battle are the very foundations of Game Freak's iconic RPG series, but few titles exemplify those core concepts as powerfully as this latest outing. Pokémon Legends: Arceus tasks you with exploring a bygone era of the Sinnoh region, then known as Hisui, and gives you more ways than ever to complete your Pokédex. While some elements don't feel like their final forms, I love where this new direction takes the Pokémon series.\n\nWe will be hopping into Alex's current save during today's stream and focusing on catching Pokémon and exploring the different biomes that make up Hisui. We will try to avoid story quests since he's pretty far into the game unless you want to see a mission or two, of course. To let us know what you want to see, be sure to join us in the Twitch chat, kick your feet up, and send the week off with a bang.\nFor more on Pokémon Legends: Arceus, be sure to check out our latest episode of The GI Show for a full breakdown of Shea's review, the video version over on YouTube, and a list of every confirmed creature in the game so far!",

We will be taking key learnings from this game into future products.\n\nTo the Hyper Scape community, thank you for your passion and dedication to the world of Neo Arcadia both inside and outside the game. Your devotion to the game we built will always be cherished.” \n\nIf you haven’t yet checked out Hyper Scape, maybe consider giving it a go before April 28.

Now, we know exactly when we can trek across North America once more with our BB on PC. \n505 Games, which is publishing the title on PC, has revealed that Death Stranding Director’s Cut will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on Wednesday, March 30, 2022. It will cost $39.99, which is $10 more than it costs on PlayStation 5 where this edition of the game was first released. However, if you already own Death Stranding on PC, you’ll be able to upgrade for a much lower price. \n“Owners of Death Stranding can upgrade to the Director’s Cut for the discounted price of $9.99 by installing the current game and purchasing through the in-game storefront,” 505 Games writes in a press release. “Those who still need a copy of the base game can find it at a discounted rate of 70% off during Steam’s Lunar Sales (Thursday, January 27 through Thursday, February 3). \nAs for what to expect, the Director’s Cut on PC brings higher frame rates, ultrawide monitor support, and a “feature-rich photo mode” to the game. \n“Death Stranding Director’s Cut on PC enhances the groundbreaking title with higher frame rates, ultrawide monitor support, and a stunning photo mode,” 505 Games says. “Thanks to the power of Intel’s new Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) graphics technology recently revealed at CES 2022, Death Stranding has never looked more hauntingly beautiful. Navigate a fractured world as Sam Bridges on a treacherous journey to reunite America, complete with an expanded storyline, new stealth missions, combat abilities, and more.” \nDeath Stranding Director’s Cut will hit Steam and the Epic Games Store on March 30.

It was first announced way back in 2012, and at E3 that year, we got a glimpse of what to expect in the Uncharted-esque bounty hunter title. It looked great, too. \nHowever, anyone familiar with the history of 1313 knows that 2012 was also the last year that we officially saw the title. Of course, gameplay and details from it have continued to leak over the years and today is another one of those days where we learn something new about it. That’s because new and unseen 1313 footage has leaked online, just a day after the latest episode of The Book of Boba Fett, no less, which held a surprise for Star Wars video game fans. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThis time, the footage features Boba Fett chasing after some people on the advanced Jedi headquarters city of Coruscant, and like previous 1313 footage that’s leaked online, it’s clearly a work-in-progress, or rather, a snapshot of what was once a work-in-progress. It looks great, though!\nIt begins with a much more detailed Coruscant marketplace before Boba Fett gives chase, and it’s during this chase sequence we see a much-less detailed exterior of a Coruscant building. You can also see the Uncharted inspiration all over it, too, which isn’t surprising given that Uncharted 2 director Amy Hennig was attached to the game at one point. \nWhile it’s neat to see this unseen footage of a game that will never be, it definitely hurts because it looks fun. The same can be said for the Darth Maul game we’ll never get to play. You can watch some footage from that Darth Maul title for a taste of what we were in for. \nWhat would you rather see resurrected – 1313 or the Darth Maul game? Let us know in the comments below!",

This means you’ll be able to take the ice as some of the great icons making a name for themselves in the sport, from Team USA’s speedy Kendall Coyne-Schofield to Team Canada’s “Captain Clutch” Marie-Philip Poulin. \nThis is a great moment for the women’s game, and the impact isn’t lost on the players. Marie-Philip Poulin said in an EA Sports press release that “It has been such a privilege to lace up my digital skates for the very first time in NHL\nYou can watch the trailer above to see elite talents, like Hilary Knight, Sarah Nurse, and Amanda Kessel, react to the news and further discuss its significance. While the trailer also provides our first look at these players on the virtual ice, it will be interesting to see how EA Vancouver represents the different style of play in women’s hockey, which relies less on the body and focuses more on stick play to separate players from the puck. There’s also more puck possession and chances to score in the women’s game. \nThe update also makes the IIHF Men’s World Championship playable. EA confirmed sixteen international men’s teams and ten international women’s teams will be available for their respective World Championship modes alongside other popular destinations, such as Online Versus, Threes Now, and Shootout. The latest patch will go live shortly after the latest episode of EA Sports and Uninterrupted Canada’s five-part digital series Breaking Ice, which profiles champions of diversity in hockey.\nYou can read more about the latest update in the patch notes here.",

We might kill a couple dozen zombies while we’re at it, too. \nDying Light was released on January 27, 2015, and in many ways, it took gamers by surprise. It was a new entry in a franchise, which is exciting enough, but it was also released in a period of the year where not many games do. That’s not necessarily the case anymore, but that’s because Techland and Dying Light popularized (or at least strengthened the idea of) the January release, and they did so to great success. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe studio didn’t stop there, though, as it continued to support the game for years and years.  Just today, Techland announced that it’s giving away free weapon skins in honor of Dying Light’s seven-year anniversary. It seems it’s planning to give the same kind of support to its upcoming sequel because yesterday, Techland revealed its five-year DLC roadmap for Dying Light 2. \nThere’s still a little over a week to go until we all get our hands on Dying Light 2, though, so for now, join us in playing Dying Light again. Game Informer editor John Carson will be behind the controls today, and he’s joined by fellow editor Marcus Stewart. They'll go live at 2 p.m. CT! \nWe can’t wait to hang out with you on Twitch and mow down some zombies, so be sure to subscribe to the official Game Informer Twitch channel. Doing so will grant you access to the official Game Informer Discord Channel where members of the community hang out to talk games, movies, TV, wrestling, and so much more.",

Neon Dynasty marks the first return to a fan-favorite plane in 20 years, but instead of working with the same tropes used back in the day, Kamigawa has received a bit of a glow-up.\nSet in the present day, 1200 years after our previous visit, Kamigawa is now home to a cybernetic civilization full of robotics, body modifications, and of course, plenty of neon lights. It’s now Magic’s most high-tech plane, a Japanese-inspired cyberpunk realm that I never thought we’d ever see. However, the Kamigawa of old is not lost, as this advanced society lives in balance with the kami, spirits, and nature we know and love.\nLike the ne…",

The punching marsupial first graced North American audiences in 2001 on Dreamcast, PC, and Game Boy Advance and starred in three subsequent titles in the following years. Though the series never reached the heights of a Crash Bandicoot or Ratchet & Clank, that hasn’t stopped Tate Multimedia from resurrecting the forgotten mascot for a brand new adventure.\nKao the Kangaroo is a brand-new title coming this summer that lets players jump, swing, climb, and pummel their way through a variety of colorful worlds. If you’ve caught yourself reminiscing about Kao asking, \"wonder if they'll ever make a new one of those?\" this is your day. Take a look at how Kao is being modernized in the trailer below. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nKao the Kangaroo doesn’t have a firm release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
