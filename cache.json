          "description": "We're LIVE from the past, present, and future.\nIf you have any interest in Super Nintendo RPGs, then you’ve likely heard of Live A Live. Released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, it came out during what many claim is Square Enix's — then known as Square, or Squaresoft in the West — 'Golden Era', launching just under a year after Secret of Mana, and barely six months after Final Fantasy VI, two of the developer’s most well-known games on the system. Oh, and just months later, something called Chrono Trigger came out, too. Not a bad time for the RPG developer, then?\nUnlike the aforementioned trio, however, this game never saw an official release outside of Japan – until now. Live A Live has been revived for the modern age with a glorious HD-2D lick of paint, the same retro-modern visual style made famous by Octopath Traveler and used again in Triangle Strategy. We’ve had a chance to go hands-on with four of the game’s chapters – three of which are playable in the recently released demo — and we can confidently say that, even 28 years later, Live A Live still feels like one of the most unique RPG experiences we’ve ever sat down with.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Former Nintendo of America employee Kit Ellis has now chimed in via social media, stating how it probably means \"nothing\" and is likely tied to licensing - with this week marking one year of the OLED model:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.\nReplaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.\nRead more",

But the real joy is its characters. It's a cast of suspects that are both wacky and relatable, and I love them.\nRead more",

Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.\nAs first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there's no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve's added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”\nRead more",

This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around. \r\n\n \nRead more",

There's a new trailer for it below, but it's not a new game. Space Bob launched in 2018, sold poorly, and then its developer left the games industry. That developer is returning now to take a second swing at the game and released a major update earlier this week.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje.

Nintendo describes the color scheme as \"a set of one blue and one yellow gradient Joy-Con controllers with white underbellies and a white, graffiti-themed Nintendo Switch dock.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUwmGziglpc\nThe company re-iterates that this will be the same Switch OLED model that sports the 7-inch upgraded screen, complete with the wired LAN port in the dock, and 64GB of storage space. In other words, you aren't missing much if you don't want the new dock or the Joy-Con. The Splatoon 3 Switch OLED will cost $359.99.\nI won't lose sleep over not picking this one up, but Splatoon fans will likely jump at the opportunity to pick something up! It's not every day (or year, really) that Splatoon gets a big celebration like this in hardware form.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1544667690484252672\nAlso arriving on September 9 is the Splatoon 3 Switch Pro Controller (which will retail for $74.99), and the Splatoon 3 Switch carrying case (which retails for $24.99).\nThe post Nintendo is releasing a Splatoon 3 Switch OLED this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

So if you think you can get through roughly 20-ish hours of story in six days, you can just finish it! This trial comes directly after the release date announcement for the sequel, which is coming later this year in October.\nLike all trials, you need to be a Switch Online subscriber to partake. You can find the trial here, or via the eShop directly on the Switch.\nThere's two bonuses to this July 2022 Mario + Rabbids free trial run\nThe full game is on sale for $9.99 through July 20: so if you decide to buy in, you can upgrade to the full version from the trial (Nintendo also reminds us that save data will be preserved, so you won't need to start over if you upgrade after the trial)\nAs usual, you'll net 100 platinum for participating in the trial: if you own the full game, just boot it up during this period to get the points\nThe post Switch Online users can play Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle for free for six days appeared first on Destructoid.",

With a hidden input.\nWithout spoiling anything, if you ever want to replay the DLC's secret boss (or just try the ghost-busting mausoleums again for the heck of it), here's how: stand facing the level entrance on Cuphead's overworld and hold the L+R triggers until it opens back up.\nI saw the tip on Reddit and tried it on PS4 using L1+R1, and sure enough, it all works.

          "description": "I live among the creatures of the fight\nIt's been over a decade since former Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono asked a room of San Diego Comic-Con attendees to literally wave money in the air to \"prove\" how much they wanted a brand new title in M.I.A. series Darkstalkers. And how many sequels has the Gothic fight franchise seen since that fateful show of dedication? Try zero. The stunt didn't take with the suits, and Darkstalkers remains in a shallow grave on the grounds of Capcom HQ.\nOne thing that Capcom has been showing passion for, however, is retro compilations, having released three such titles in as many years.

          "description": "The response to the Trilogy sidelined some projects\nIt looks like Rockstar may be laying off the remasters for a bit. A new report says remasters of both Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto IV were in consideration, but now Rockstar is shelving the projects.\nWord first broke from Rockstar leaker Tez, who claimed a reliable source said these remasters were \"on the table a few years ago,\" but Rockstar has chosen not to proceed with the projects in mind.\nToday, Kotaku followed up with a report, saying they could confirm that Tez's tweet is accurate to what they've been told.\nhttps://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1543974193259319303\nThe decision seems to be indicative of the poor response Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition received. Response at launch indicates it was a technical mess, with patches rolling out soon after to try and tune the project. Rockstar publicly apologized for the state of the Trilogy.\nAs both Tez and Kotaku indicate, it looks like the remaster trilogy put some ideas on hold. According to Kotaku's sources, Rockstar is hoping people will forget about the remaster as it focuses its attention on Grand Theft Auto VI.\nKotaku does say that while the plan is to get the next GTA out the door, the future is open. Their sources say a possible Red Dead Redemption or GTA IV remaster aren't \"out of scope\" and could happen after VI ships.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1JJt7xHTlE\nTaking some time\nThe possibility of a Red Dead Redemption remaster in particular is tantalizing. It's also been rumored for a while now. A report from Kotaku last year revealing the Trilogy remaster also indicated RDR would be due up, if the re-releases did well.\nIt now looks like those plans will have to wait until after Grand Theft Auto VI is out, though.\nThe post Rockstar reportedly shelves plans for Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto IV remasters appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yesterday, the Splatoon NA Twitter account posted a teaser of a Splatoon 3 map in some decaying ruins.\nDubbed \"Mincemeat Metalworks,\" this facility was made from scrap metal, in order to make more metal. There's also some notable commentary here, that there was once a sea here but it evaporated.\nThe map itself has a cool juxtaposition between the cold steel ruins, baking in the sun and heat, with the paint globs and inflatable cover Splatoon is known for.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1543942800005267456\nThe whole vibe of Splatoon 3 seems to carry on this theme of aquatic life taking over a messed-up world. It's worked well for Splatoon in the past, and the Splatlands seems like it could be a cool new area to explore.\nEnter the Splatlands\nIt's not just new maps, though. Splatoon 3 also has some cosmetic changes that will help players have a much more visually distinct squid-kid avatar.\nThe team recently showed off the tricolor eyes and customizable eyebrows that Splatoon 3 will have as well. Plus, new hairstyles and fresh fashion. I mean, Splatoon is an ink-based shooter, but it's also about fashion.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ngPsn5d5A\nSplatoon 3 was recently locked in for a September 9 date on Nintendo Switch. The messy shooter will essentially close out Nintendo's summer. Hopefully we get to see more of it soon; while we've had updates on the multiplayer and PvE Salmon Run mode, I'd still love to see a deeper dive into the single-player portion.\nWhether we get a Direct with more info soon or not, Splatoon 3 is set to launch on September 9.\nThe post Splatoon 3 teases one of its multiplayer maps, Mincemeat Metalworks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Microsoft says it has \"reached the limit\"\nIt's hard for Games with Gold to stand out in this giveaway-heavy climate, especially with so many players fixated on Xbox Game Pass, where the catalog runs deep and feels pretty consistently fresh. Today, Microsoft gave a heads-up about an upcoming change: starting in October 2022, the monthly \"free\" game lineups will no longer feature Xbox 360 titles.\nThe team explained the change in an email to Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and it makes sense — but I've still got questions.\n\"We have reached the limit of our ability to bring Xbox 360 games to the catalog; however, Games with Gold will continue to include exciting Xbox One titles and exclusive savings each month,\" the company said in an email. \"This will not impact any Xbox 360 games that you downloaded before October 2022.\"\n\"Any Xbox 360 titles that you redeem via Games with Gold before that time are yours to keep on your Xbox account, regardless of whether you continue your subscription. Thank you for being a loyal member.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_333275\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1280\"] Xbox Games with Gold for July 2022.[/caption]\nSo, we've got a few more months of business as usual with a pair of featured Xbox One and Xbox 360 games for subscribers to claim and keep. For reference, the sleepy selections for July — Beasts of Maravilla Island, Relicta, Thrillville: Off the Rails, and Torchlight — are a good indicator of where things are at with Games with Gold.\nI'm curious to see how they might offset this change in October — will subscribers get more than two Xbox One games each month? Or is a quality-over-quantity approach a better choice? We've been through downgrades before with, say, PlayStation Plus.\nGames with Gold can feel like a relic, and I have to wonder how much longer it'll last before it's refocused or fully sunsetted.

          "description": "Great games for a good cause\nItch.io is known for its bundles of indie games that raise money for worthy causes, like the Black Lives Matter movement back in 2020 or for Ukraine earlier this year. Now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, itch.io has turned its sights to creating a bundle of indie games to raise money for abortion funds. The bundle has over 750 items from over 600 creators, valued at around $3000, but you can get it for a minimum donation of $10 (although of course, anything more than that is awesome). As someone who adores indie games, that's the steal of the century if you ask me.\nAll proceeds of the bundle will go directly towards the National Network for Abortion Fund's Collective Power Fund which, according to the bundle's official page, \"moves money directly to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action.\"\nFrom the sounds of it, this is a great way to get started if you're looking for a way to support the cause.\nhttps://twitter.com/itchio/status/1543972913476280321\nAs of writing this article, the bundle has already raised over $150,000 of its $200,000 goal, and with over eight days left, I have a feeling it will surpass that number. The Ukraine bundle ended up with more than $6 million going to charity, while the Racial Equality bundle raised a whopping $8.1 million.\nHere's hoping that gamers will show up for reproductive rights in the same way, but considering how much the community shows up in times of need, plus what great titles there are on offer, I don't think we have anything to worry about.\nThe post Itch.io is raising money for reproductive rights with the Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds appeared first on Destructoid.",

The project recently announced on Twitter that they had acquired a scan for the English manual for 90 Minutes European Prime Goal, which, while not a marquee SNES release, was the last manual!\nAs project purveyor Peebs points out, this started as a grassroots effort roughly two years ago to get that number up to 100% from the previous figure of 52%. For reference, that's over 800 manuals that are housed on the site, which you can access directly here. They're lived-in, too! You can even see the imperfections and wear and tear on some — in a good way.\nFlipping through the project list (which I recommend doing at least once) showcases the raw scope of it. Remember this is every English manual, even ones that are from the NA/PAL regions, as well as manuals with errors or slight phrasing differences. And rather than resting on their laurels, the crew is pursuing Super Famicom (Japan) manual logging as we speak.\nSNES manuals aren't the only thing on offer\nOf note: the manual project also has Nintendo 64 manuals available, as well as all 22 Virtual Boy games covered. No lie, the latter comes in real handy whenever I bust out my Virtual Boy! There's some neat IPD (interpupillary distance) configuration type stuff in some of those booklets.\nInterestingly, Nintendo still has its archive of NES and SNES manuals up to coincide with the release of the \"Mini\" console lines.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czWJ-Ys_dOk\nThe post SNES fan project finishes goal: collects all English Super Nintendo manuals in one place appeared first on Destructoid.",

These are both titles that deal with group dynamics, friendship, politics, technology, moral turbulence, and character-based comedy — all traits that make up the emotive space opera universe of Mass Effect.\nDeMarle's new role at BioWare follows their leaving Eidos Montreal in the wake of the Embracer Group purchase. With a resume of stone-cold narrative classics, and multiple awards to their name, DeMarle is a valuable, prestigious, and highly sought-after writer. No doubt their talent for engrossing, compelling, and, most importantly, immersive storytelling will be a major ace in \"Mass Effect 4's\" sleeve.

The strategy classic originally arrived on July 3, 2002, and changed the genre (and eventually, other subgenres) forever.\nI can vividly recall when Warcraft III came out, as a friend of mine took off school for several days, and declined to hang out with my gaming group that weekend in favor of playing through the entire campaign. That act of isolation ensorcelled me into running out and buying it, and once we had a LAN setup going at his house, the rest was history. By then Warcraft III had fully caught on in the zeitgeist, and was on its way to becoming one of the most popular strategy games of all time.\nBefore long, we were playing hundreds of hours of custom games. Entire weekends were spent (with Diablo 2 hell mode breaks) trying to find the best custom games possible, and we'd all go out in these little individual excursion missions downloading them before taking turns presenting the group with the coolest, most-lasting maps to play. Eventually, someone found DOTA, and that turned into its own game (and genre) — but you know that story!\nYears later, when we met my wife, one of the first things we did was surf custom games together (lots of tower defense!). It's been a unifying element throughout my entire life as long as it has existed.\nAll of the above is why it's such a shame that Reforged replaced the original client going forward. While the re-release did finally get an update recently, it's not only too little too late, but it's not enough. Hopefully if Blizzard hasn't gotten around to it but the time Microsoft takes over, the new owners will make it right. If all else fails, just de-couple Reforged entirely: the classic version of the game deserves to live on beyond file sharing.\nThe post Warcraft III turns 20 this week, and the original left quite the legacy appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's not quite a relaxing island vacation\nDeveloper Dreamloop Games and publisher Aksys are teaming up for a new social thriller. Inescapable is a new adventure game, directly inspired by Danganronpa, about how far some might go for cash and clout.\nDescribed as a social thriller / ontological mystery game, Inescapable was revealed over the weekend as part of Aksys Games' Anime Expo 2022 panel. It seems to wear its inspiration on its sleeve, though it has a few twists of its own.\nInescapable follows Harrison, one of 11 contestants who are kidnapped and made to take part in a reality TV show. At the end of their stay, the contestants get $500,000. But there are no rules, and no escape.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZIuIlh0dlc\nNo way home\nIt seems likely that, given time, some suspicion and murder might begin to take place. Much of it seems to be about mistrust, so I'm curious what the motivation would be to turn these contestants on each other.\nConsidering the last Danganronpa game (or at least the last mystery-focused one) was in 2017, I'm intrigued by what's being put together here. It's got similar vibes to the second Danganronpa and its summer vacation setting, with some style all its own. I dig the plastic standees used in the world here, for example.\n\nSo far, we've just seen some dialogue windows and cutscenes. I'm curious what the actual mystery and, if inspired by Danganronpa, murder side of Inescapable looks like.\nDreamloop has been steadily building up work though, partnering for technical support on several games. Its last collaboration with Aksys was on 2018's Switch release of Stardust Galaxy Warriors: Stellar Climax.\nNow, it's tackling the thriller and suspicion of an island vacation gone awry. We'll see how it comes together when Inescapable launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC sometime in 2023.\nThe post Inescapable is a Danganronpa-inspired thriller coming next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Importing and the collector's edition (for one out of three figures) are two of the only options at the moment\nRight now the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak amiibo hunt continues to be a mystery in the US, with no retailer sightings beyond the collector's edition: which comes with the lone Malzeno figure.\nThe others (the Canyne Malzeno Palamute and the Felyne Malzeno Palico) are nowhere to be found in the region.\nHere's a quick recap of how the Sunbreak amiibo situation is going worldwide:\nYou can pre-order them now on Play-Asia or Amazon Japan, but they'll be shipping in late September/August depending on the retailer: some users are reporting that Play-Asia is canceling select pre-orders\nSome UK/EU regions are reporting that they are available at retail, and are all out now with the release of Sunbreak itself\nAgain, the US release is a complete mystery outside of the Malzeno figure being locked to the collector's edition. As the Amiibo News Twitter account points out, the US site removed the amiibo category altogether. The current guess is that they'll be GameStop releases, with no open pre-order period: but having spoken to multiple GameStops in my region, they are not listed in the system yet, and managers have no idea when they might arrive. If they do come to GameStop, it could be a free-for-all \"order in store\" situation.\nAs usual, if you're a collector, consider importing! Given the current global supply chain issues they might end up becoming a rare little trio: or, things could smooth over and there could be plenty of stock. Even before 2020, it was always a gamble when it comes to amiibo.\n[Update: A Twitter reader has pointed out to Destructoid that there are CPSIA ratings for English release figures (Malzeno, Palamute, Palico), which provides some hope.]\nThe post The Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak amiibo situation is still a mystery in the US appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A Rough Deal\nOne of our favorite spoilers, the Australian Classification ratings board, has updated its website with a new PlayStation listing for Daniel Mullins Games' deck-builder Inscryption, suggesting that the spooky roguelike card game is headed to PS4 in the very near future.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPBP3kWDcNk\nReleased on PC in the fall of 2021, Inscryption turned plenty of heads in double-quick time with its incredibly creepy and disturbing aesthetic, compelling strategy gameplay, and fascinating \"found footage\" framing device. The indie hit would go on to feature in many Best of Year lists, even winning the Game of the Year award at the prestigious Game Developers Choice Award and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Awards.\nWhile the title is yet to receive an announcement of any such port, this new rating all but confirms that Inscryption is headed to the console market. While this rating is strictly for PlayStation platforms, it is difficult to imagine that publisher Devolver Digital will not also be looking to release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. We will be sure to give you a heads up when official confirmation is forthcoming.\nInscryption is available now on PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.\nThe post Inscryption PS4 port pops up on Australian ratings board appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The current figure includes shipments and digital sales\nCapcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion just hit two million in sales (with Rise reaching the 10-million-sales milestone), and to celebrate, a free Sunbreak gift is on the way on July 7 (in the form of \"two item packs\").\nThe news comes straight from Capcom's own site, where the publisher gloats a bit about how far the franchise has come as a whole:\n\"Beginning with the first title in 2004, the series established a new genre in which players cooperate to hunt ferocious monsters with their friends and has since grown into a global phenomenon with cumulative sales of the series exceeding 84 million units shipped as of July 5, 2022.\"\n\nAs a recap, currently, Monster Hunter Rise is soundly in the top five all-time sales list for Capcom, with the old figure of nine million units sold. If the 10 million mark fully clears and the site is updated, it'll surpass Resident Evil 2 and sit just below Resident Evil 7 (10.80 million units) in third place. From there, it likely will beat out RE7, then it'll have to take on Monster Hunter World's 21 million units (previously 18 million, before today's figure) to supplant the top spot.\nThe post Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak sales hit two million, free gift coming appeared first on Destructoid.",

It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. \nForspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. \nForspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.",

The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch.

Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway.

This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nthe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in the Bravely Default games. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation, but do move appropriately to convey emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.\nUbisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.\nUntil then, are you excited for Skull & Bones?

A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.\nThe remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said \"The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content.

The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative.

It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.\nAdmittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem.

Ltd. supervisor Genki Yokata, Intelligent Systems character designer and supervisor Toshiyuki Kusakihara, Team Ninja head and producer Yosuke Hayashi, and Koei Tecmo Games director Hayato Iwata to learn more about Three Hopes. We dove deep into the making of this new Musou, how the teams integrated Three Houses into it,…",

And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I've gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls. In other words, I'm confident that Overwatch 2 might not look like a completely different experience from its forebear, but it definitely plays like one.  \n\n\nIt is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture.

          "description": "Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. \nAre you excited for Cult of the Lamb?

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review).

In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",

As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.\nIf you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title \"Still working on it.\" The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.\nRegardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us.

Check out the short trailer below; it's as deliciously chaotic as you'd expect. \nThere was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.\n@FinalFantasy Origin's first expansion Trials of the Dragon King launches July 20th. pic.twitter.com/YvGEwGh1ux\nJune 30, 2022\nIn Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, \"You will die here, and I will live forever.\" We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. \nStranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, \"Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else.\"\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.\ncoverage here.\n\n\n\nThe Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.\nOn top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!",

In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!\n\n\nThe first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, \"How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?\" To which I responded, \"Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now.\" Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.\nWe're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.",

In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. \nThe Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. \n\n\nThe second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  \n\n\nLastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. \n\n\nTri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. \nThis shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. \n“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” \nThis news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nAccording to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.\n[Source: GamesBeat]",

          "description": "You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. \nAzra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:\n“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”\nAzra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” \nCivilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. \nAs Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”",

          "description": "The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.\nJane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. \nThe Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.\n\n\n\n\nJane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel's Avengers.",

          "description": "Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. \nThe game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.\nHarvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. \n\n\nWhen you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. \nHarvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.",

Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.\n\n\nIn a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.\nGotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.",

Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers' exploration-heavy gameplay. \nAs seen during today's Nintendo Direct Mini, while exploring the open world (which you can read about in my previous preview), I collected special items called Portal Gears.

Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.\nBoth Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.",
