          "description": "Survive in the nightmare that is the Dragon Ball universe.\nVideo games based on the Dragon Ball franchise usually have a very specific focus. While there have been the occasional RPGs like Kakarot or The Legacy of Goku thrown into the mix, most have been firmly focused on fighting your way across the series’ story. However, Dragon Ball: The Breakers has the guts to do something completely different. It doesn’t always hit the right notes but it is unique enough that fans of the anime and manga will be thrilled for at least several hours\nInstead of battling it out against some of the most iconic villains in anime history, you are given a taste of how nightmarish it would be to live as a normal person in the Dragon Ball universe. This is an asymmetrical 7v1 survival game remarkably similar to the likes of Dead by Daylight or Friday the 13th: The Game. In fact, there is very little in The Breakers that tries to change or advance the formula presented in these titles other than offering a more colourful aesthetic and cartoonish atmosphere.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Luckily, there are some fantastic indie games out there that look to recapture the spirit of the anti-gravity racing series. And Aero GPX might just be the best example we've ever seen.\nThis PC-bound racer's Kickstarter launched today and has been developed by one person — Aaron McDevitt. The game is primarily inspired by F-Zero X and F-Zero GX, but McDevitt also took a shine to Wave Race 64 and Kirby Air Ride, wrapping Wave Race's summer vibes and Kirby's pick-up-and-play nature in some hardcore, fast-paced racing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Chomping at the bit.\nThe craze now coined as “bronyism” — a heavily documented My Little Pony fandom that took root in 2010 — turned out to be more about inclusion than it did the show (Friendship is Magic) itself. Despite our attempts to get into it based on recommendations, we found its adult appeal largely overvalued. It acted as a conduit for individuals to share and be part of something, and every Brony surely knows, deep down, that the primary attraction is its related community. However, it turned out to be just the beginning of the next decade of media output and social-political causes that operated on a similar set of principles.\nTwelve years on, and the fandom isn’t ready to quit just yet. Them’s Fightin’ Herds isn’t a licensed product and doesn’t feature a single character from the show, but its art style, themes and execution are so perfectly accurate to its influence that it takes scrutiny to realise it’s not an official Hasbro product. Obviously, the horse in the room here is that Lauren Faust, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic’s creator, rendered the game’s cast of characters, making it feel totally authentic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "We promise the Rabbids’ antics aren’t too annoying.\nMario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle came about like a fever dream in 2017. Nintendo lending Ubisoft its poster child franchise? A Rabbid dressing up as Princess Peach? Mario wielding a gun? Madness. More surprising still, it turned out to be a ridiculously good strategy game – one of the best on Switch. The sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, has seen the general sense of surprise associated with the first replaced with one of expectation. No longer does anyone doubt whether Ubisoft can make a decent strategy game with the Mario licence, and — perhaps more astonishingly — few critics bemoan the inclusion of the chaotic little Rabbids in the Mushroom Kingdom. Five years later, the question now is whether or not Ubisoft has improved upon the formula born from gaming’s most unexpected crossover.\nThe answer is as complicated as Rabbids are dense. Much has changed since Beep-O and the Rabbids found themselves crossing dimensions into the Mushroom Kingdom. Despite both being strategy games with light RPG elements, Sparks of Hope plays quite differently than its predecessor, to the point where it feels almost like a different game. Gone are the labyrinthine maps interspersed with battles and block-based puzzles to solve. Instead, Sparks of Hope introduces five vibrant worlds which Rabbids have colonised, full of challenges, quirky characters, and little secrets to discover by solving simple puzzles, which are no longer restricted to the block-based variety. Classic coloured coin challenges, secret stages reminiscent of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and more make for welcome additions.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Looking cool, Joker!\nWell, all you lovely people, it finally happened. After literally years of pretending like it wasn’t sure there would be an audience, Atlus has brought Persona 5 to the Switch. And though this belated port hasn’t brought with it any major new upgrades or changes, we’re pleased to report that Persona 5 Royal is every bit as magnificent and memorable an experience as it’s always been. If you’re an RPG fan and somehow haven’t yet gotten around to playing this game, you should pick it up as soon as possible.\nPersona 5 Royal has a plot that feels like a cross between Inception and a superhero story, placing you in the role of Joker, a quiet high school student who has become a victim of circumstance. While walking home from school one day, you witness a woman being assaulted by a man and intervene. The man is accidentally injured and sues you for damages, which results in you being given a criminal conviction, expelled from school, and sent into the city to attend Shujin Academy. Not long after you arrive at Shujin, you gain the ability to access “The Metaverse”, an alternate plane of existence born out of people’s cognition. Within the Metaverse are Palaces — bizarre dungeons based upon the twisted way that certain people in power view real locations and people. For example, the first Palace is a castle ruled by Kamoshida, a physically and sexually abusive volleyball coach who sees Shujin Academy and its students as things to use as he pleases.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.\nRead more",

That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.\nYou can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ.

Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65\" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my \"Do I like Persona 5?\" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm \"No, mate, you don't\". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.\n\n \nRead more",

Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.\nNow? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang.

          "description": "A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.\nThat brings me to the subject of today's deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!)

Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.\nI was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, \"Is there a story?\". And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)\nRomancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.\nThe demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)\n Read more",

          "description": "Coral Island  self-describes as a \"reimagining of farming games\", but if we're being real it doesn't reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).\nThat's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "Look good while looking at the lights\nWhen you next get involved in a street fight — as we all do — you might want to ensure that you're dressed for success, (or at least to impress), by donning one of these full-print Street Fighter bomber jackets, now available to order from merchandiser NERDS Clothing.\nOfficially produced in collaboration with Capcom, the powerfully colored jackets are styled after several members of the Street Fighter roster, with variants for legendary World Warriors Ryu, Chun-Li, Bison, Cammy, and new boy Luke. Each jacket features a color scheme typified by the character, with a full backprint showcasing the fighter in action. Somewhat anachronistically, the jackets are also emblazoned with an embroidered Street Fighter V logo, right on the cusp of Street Fighter 6's vaunted release.\nhttps://twitter.com/NERDSClothingCo/status/1582068026777563136?s=20&t=BuudnLBe7wEwNUhezKmeLw\nI'm obviously a dedicated and dyed-in-the-wool Street Fighter disciple, but it's not in my build or age range to rock one of these bad boys.  Perhaps, however, they are more in keeping with your own sense of style and fashion.  If so, then you can check out the entire range over on the official NERDS Clothing website, where the jackets are available to order for $125 USD each (not including shipping costs).\n(Edit: Since this article was published, all jackets — along with a range of new shirts — have suddenly been listed as being \"sold out\".  This is a little curious, given that they haven't even been available for a day, and the entire stock, in all eight sizes, has seemingly cleared out. I have reached out to the company for clarity.)\nStreet Fighter V is available now on PlayStation and PC. Street Fighter 6 will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Official Street Fighter bomber jackets will see you get beat up in style appeared first on Destructoid.",

Most of my purchases were novels designed to make me look intelligent and well-informed when guests see them on my shelves. But one was a pure nostalgia purchase. Earlier this year, Abrams Books released a compendium of The Uncanny X-Men trading cards that were illustrated by Jim Lee. These cards were a massive part of my childhood. I used to have an incredibly thick binder that had hundreds of these cards in it, and every once in a while, I would thumb through its pages, gawking at my collection.\nWhile sentimental, the book’s decision to limit one side of one card per page makes it a rather annoying…",

The new pad features a wide variety of customizable components and redefinable functions, ranging from trigger stop guards and replaceable thumbstick modules to programmable buttons, and save states for custom game layouts, alongside adjustable \"dead zones\" and trigger pressure.\nYou can check out the DualSense Edge's features in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvmmWeov68s\nAlongside its swappable thumb grips, modules, and triggers, the DualSense Edge will also feature a tough, braided USB cord complete with lock, to prevent those accidental disconnects.  The controller sports advanced Haptic Feedback technology as well as built-in audio controls for headphones and the onboard speaker.  In addition, the Edge's sleek carry case will also double as a charging dock (though it must remain wired in order to charge the controller.  It is not a battery backup device.)\nThe Sony DualSense Edge Wireless Controller will launch January 2023 at a retail price of $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the price of the PS5 digital console itself.

Ghostbusters on the NES is among the worst games I’ve ever played.\nThe go-to answer for a Ghostbusters game done right is Ghostbusters: The Video Game, and it’s absolutely a decent effort.

          "description": "The apocalypse never looked so stylish\nIf I know anything about gamers, it's that we love to show our love of gaming to others, and what better way to do that than to wear your favorite game right on your clothing?  If you happen to love Horizon: Forbidden West in particular, you're really in luck, because Guerrilla has teamed up with ASOS to create a brand new line of loungewear inspired by the game.  The various shirts, hoodies, and pants all feature bright prints with various iconography from Forbidden West, and they're the perfect statement piece for the fashionable gamers out there.\nThere are five different looks in total, including an all-over printed hoodie and jogger set, a long-sleeved mesh top, an over-sized printed t-shirt, a crewneck hoodie, and a brown co-ord hoodie and jogger set.  All of the pieces are unisex, which means anybody can achieve the cool, oversized loungewear look.  My personal favorite is the crewneck hoodie, which features comic panels inspired by Horizon: Forbidden West.  The all-over prints are a bit busy for my taste, but I would for sure get cozy in that brown set any day of the week.\n\nThe pieces range from £26 for the shirts to £76 for the co-ord set, but overall I'd say that's pretty affordable for this kind of product. I guess it is ASOS, after all.  Unfortunately, the Horizon x ASOS collab is only available to those in the EU, UK, Japan, and Asia regions, but for everyone else, I would put money down on people listing these on eBay (for a higher price, but still).  At the very least, it's nice to look, and we can hope that they'll ship to the US in the future.\nYou know what awesome gaming clothing store does ship out here, though?  Insert Coin Clothing.  They've been a staple for gaming clothing for years, and their stuff is always amazing quality.\nThe post Guerrilla teamed up with ASOS for a Horizon: Forbidden West loungewear collection appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The lead is leaving after over 11 years at the company\nThe director behind the upcoming Splinter Cell remake is leaving Ubisoft.\nDavid Grivel announced his departure on LinkedIn, as spotted by VGC. Grivel started out at Ubisoft Paris working on Ghost Recon: Future Soldier before moving to Toronto's office. There, he worked on games including Splinter Cell Blacklist, the Far Cry series, and eventually the remake of Splinter Cell.\n\"After more than 11 years at Ubisoft, it is now time for me to go on a new adventure,\" Grivel wrote on his LinkedIn page. \"11 years is a long time and summing it up in one post is quasi-impossible but I must say, I’ve been lucky. Lucky to work with so many great people over the years. Made so many friends.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH1_ZCSf_HY\nWhile he's leaving the studio, it sounds like Grivel is not leaving the games industry. The now-former director says to \"stay tuned\" for what is next for him.\nChaos theory\nWith its director departing, it'll be interesting to see what Ubisoft is up to with the new take on Splinter Cell. The company has reportedly seen above-average turnover, some of which has been attributed to the reported-on studio culture at Ubisoft.\nThe Splinter Cell remake has quietly been in development at Ubisoft Toronto. Though we've only seen confirmation and a short teaser for it, we've heard a few details.\nThis includes that the new take on Sam Fisher's story won't be open world. And it will re-tackle the story for a \"modern-day audience\" as well. No release date has been set for the project.\nThe post Splinter Cell Remake director is leaving Ubisoft appeared first on Destructoid.",

It looks like we're going to have to wait a little longer for full details on the anime's narrative and cast, but it's clear that NieR: Automata Ver1.1a is more of an adaptation of the NieR universe and its interplanetary warfare in general, rather than a direct retelling of the events depicted in Platinum's smash-selling video game series.\nNieR: Automata Ver1.1a will premiere in Japan in early 2023.  NieR: Automata is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. A long-awaited Nintendo Switch port, known as \"The End of YoRHa Edition\" was released worldwide on October 6.  You can check out Jonathan Holmes thoughts on the release right here.\nThe post Don’t blink during this teaser trailer for the NieR: Automata Ver1.1a anime appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's been a hectic week for yer boy, as several members of the good ship Destructoid are indisposed or on vacation, leaving me with a chunky inbox, several important meetings, and some deadlines that seem to be rapidly increasing their approach speed, arriving with the merciless inevitability of an unloved season... I have a lot of work to do, is what I'm saying.\nRegardless, it is the weekend, and I hope that this one finds you and yours very well indeed. Be sure to make time for the people and activities that you love, and give yourself a well-earned rest from the week's hardships. And if, like myself, you are working today, then that's cool too.

Is this going to be an attempt at accurately translating something into a video game, or is it going to abandon all reason and present some sort of unhinged parody? Priest Simulator is definitely in the latter category, but rather than just having some wacky controls that make the whole performance absurd, it goes a few steps further, into a storm drain, and gets washed out to sea.\nYou technically get up to some priest business in Priest Simulator. One could also argue that you even play as a priest.

The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/96yUNw2zfW4\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>",

It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely&nbsp;won't be for everybody.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6313356183112\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.</p>\n\n<p>Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen&nbsp;machine to play the game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Are you excited for Need For Speed Unbound?
