Just last week the world's first unboxing video appeared, followed shortly afterwards by the first comparison video, and now we have yet another look at the OLED sitting next to the original system.\nThis latest footage comes from YouTuber Kevin Kenson, who's somehow managed to get his hands on a retail version of the system a couple of weeks ahead of its official release. In it, we get to see how the OLED's screen really helps bright colours to 'pop' and those darker colours to stay truly dark – deep blacks have never looked so good on a Nintendo portable.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

These games may pilfer their core mechanics from all over the shop, and make no attempt to hide the fact in the process, but they're pure comfort food; cosy, familiar, resolutely old-fashioned in how they go about their business, and for the most part a lot of easy-breezy fun to boot.\nFirst released to fairly average reviews back in 2018, Darksiders III sees the series stripped back to its basics, removing a lot of the faff introduced in part two for a much more streamlined and basic affair. You'll do combat with all manner of demonic beasties, solve a bunch of pretty simple puzzles, take on some bosses and engage in light platforming action — there are absolutely no surprises in store here. It's the very epitome of a safe, straightforward adventure that serves up exactly what fans of the series will likely expect, a light-hearted action adventure with plenty of character in the form of its sassy cast of Horsemen and demons.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Frustrations with the livestreaming platform's ineffectual response to harrassment recently came to a head with the #ADayOffTwitch campaign, when many streamers and viewers skipped Twitch for one day. The new (optional) options are fairly nuanced, and should help channels control marauding hordes of bots and dickheads without keeping chat fully locked down.\nRead more",

Amazon's new MMO New World features both PvP and PvE gameplay, and even though it is theoretically possible to go it alone and still enjoy some of the features, joining up with other players is a lot more fun. The complex social heirarchies of New World are divided up into Factions and Companies — two separate, but linked, types of player organisation. It can all be a bit confusing, though, so below we've laid out the difference between them, as well as how to join a Faction or Company.\n Read more",

In many of the game's pre-release teasers, we saw Colt bursting into action. Stealth? No no, this is more of an FPS. The music flares, enemies die, it is carnage.\nBut when I actually give action a go in the game, I'm mostly left dead in seconds. Either that, or I meekly duck behind some cover and regret not trying the stealthy approach. And the problem is that sometimes I have no option but to go all guns blazing, and I think, \"Colt isn't built for this. He's only a squishy lad.\" I just think he's a stealth character being forced to break cover when he's clearly uncomfortable doing so.\nRead more",

But upon playing the game, people have already discovered that it's a fair bit tougher than it looks. More Dark Souls, than Zelda, perhaps.\nJust because Tunic isn't dark and gloomy doesn't mean it can't offer its fair share of challenges, so I spoke to Tunic creator Andrew Shouldice to find out how he's managing expectations, as well as tackling difficulty and accessibility.

          "description": "Squid Game is a South Korean survival drama show that's been taking Netflix by storm recently, and it's inspired a whole bunch of Squid Game games on Roblox. The show pits folks against each other in games like tug-of-war, where the winners earn cash, and the losers earn, well, death. It's a fun (read: somehow even more sinister) twist on the battle royale genre. It reminds me a bit of when the Hunger Games films inspired loads of Minecraft mods.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "NEO: The World Ends With You is out on PC today (via the Epic Games Store), and marks the grand return of a franchise that, despite a rabid fanbase and numerous re-releases, is only receiving its first sequel after 15 years. The original The World Ends With You impressed audiences on Nintendo DS as much for the game’s stylish Tokyo setting as it did for a unique battle system that saw players control multiple characters on multiple screens simultaneously. Yet what made this game really memorable was how it transformed the fashion and pop-cultural power of Shibuya into its own JRPG battle system. Your drip gave you strength, your armor made you a trendsetter, and the music and energy of the city were translated into a story about coming-of-age, self-worth and finding strength in yourself and your friends by embracing the things that make you unique. \nNow, NEO: The World Ends With You has arrived, but this long-awaited sequel is far from a simple retread of what the first game did 15 years ago. Shibuya itself has changed a lot in the intervening years and it's fascinating to see how NEO's setting and its gameplay mechanics have evolved alongside it. \nRead more",

It's just like being a real backwoods alchemist throwing twigs in a bucket!\nBut my favourite thing is the pestle and mortar.

All they need to do is compete in six games. Easy peasy, everyone thinks. How hard can that be? Only the first of those games, a riff on the classic children's game Statues / Grandma's Footsteps / Red Light Green Light - involves running toward a giant automaton with motion sensors in her eyes, as well as a team of snipers waiting in the rafters to take down anyone who does stay perfectly at the right time. \nIt's grim, but it's also the perfect blend of some of my favourite things ever: Zero Escape, Danganronpa and Battle Royale (the Japanese thriller, not the game genre) - and I implore you to give it a go.\nRead more",

The same layers, you may recall, that the Steam Deck relies on to run games without native Linux ports. In other words, games with multiplayer components that wouldn’t have worked on the Steam Deck - because their use of EAC precluded Linux/Wine/Proton compatibility - should, in theory, be able to run in full.\r\n\n \nRead more",
