No matter how many blankets I pile on top of my knees, it hangs there lurking, breathing down my neck, extending its icy mitts down my fingers until they're too frosty to carry on typing. I sometimes worry the cold will penetrate my very soul, a harbinger of something more sinister and oppressive. Oh wait. False alarm. It's just the cat giving me the evils out the corner of my eye because I've stolen their favourite woolen nap pillow. Nothing to worry about. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. \r\n\n\r\nI am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.\nRead more",

We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.\nRead more",

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or \"Succession\" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. \r\n\n\r\nI did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much \"lions led by donkeys\" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.\r\n\n\r\nRogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. \r\n\n\r\nSpoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.\n Read more",

When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.\nDespite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.\nRead more",

AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it \"a stonkingly fast gaming CPU\". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.\r\n \nRead more",

But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Since it actually is Black Friday now, we can probably rule out any further price cuts to the Samsung Pro Plus – king of the best Steam Deck microSD cards. No time like the present, then, to net yourself a top-quality storage extender for your Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.\r\n\n\r\nIt is of course possible to swap out the Deck’s internal SSD for something bigger, and if it were a desktop PC, normally that would be the way to go. But replacing components in a tightly-designed, hyper-compacted machine like Valve’s handheld is a far trickier business, and just doesn’t have the same appeal when a fast microSD like the Pro Plus is right there. Now, you can get plenty of extra space, an incomparably easier \"installation,\" and performance that still comes remarkably close to NVMe SSD level, all for up to £38 off.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Publisher PLAYISM and developer Bombservice describe it as \"the culmination\" of the series, and it's officially set to drop via Steam on January 11, 2024. \n\n\nYou can see a glimpse of the latest in the exploration-focused series in the release date trailer: \n\n\n\n\nThe original Momodora was released in 2010. Moonlit Farewell marks the fifth installment in Bombservice's series. \n\n\nMoonlit Farewell maintains the detailed, meticulously animated aesthetic of previous entries with a Sigil system that helps customize each run. Sigils can be found while exploring, during events, or purchased at shops. Effects range from attack boosts to increased healing effects, weapon summons, and beyond, and they can be turned off and on at any moment. Using an effective mix of attacks and Sigils sounds like it's going to be key to defeating the assortment of boss battles that await along the way. \n\n\nScreenshot via Playism\n\n\nBombservice promises improved visual effects in this one, with the aim of bringing the already established mystical world of the Momodora series to life. \n\n\nThe story of Moonlit Farewell is set five years after the events of 2014's Momodora III. This time around Koho village's High Priestess Momo has to set out to save the world from demons after a mysterious bell summoned them. Beyond the main Momodora storyline, there was also the 2016 prequel Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight and Minoria, a spiritual follow-up with similar thematic elements. \n\n\nWith just a little over a month to go before launch, we'll find out how the saga expands shortly. \n\nThe post New Momodora trailer reveals the ‘culmination’ of beloved Metroidvania franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll be able to find out all over again in Fight Crab 2, which PLAYISM and developer Calappa Games are preparing to bring to Early Access on Steam on February 13, 2024.\n\n\nBrace your carapace for combat in the Early Access trailer. \n\n\n\n\nFight like a crab in Fight Crab 2\n\n\nIf the novelty of the first game is still strong with you, or if this is your first crab rodeo, there are some new features to grab onto this time around. Chief among them is Career Mode, which has you raising your own crab and growing along with it as you get ready to throw it into battle. \n\n\nThroughout the campaign, you can raise your crab's stats, get new skills and weapons, and climb up the ladder of ranked matches. Once you've had your fill of fighting evil crabs or other crustacean warriors online, you can pass all the obtained skills to another aspiring crab fighter. \n\n\nThere's also a new control scheme that hews closer to a traditional third-person action game, which is just one addition aiming to make Fight Crab 2 easier to play. Another is the ability for crabs to learn skills that let them automatically perform certain actions. \n\n\nAll the claw-crackin' confrontations feature live commentary, too, just in case you're not shouting over the action enough already yourself.

Make sure to tune in to The Game Awards December 7th.\" \n\n\nMaximillian Dood says on his Twitter post, \"Curious, have these gone out to others that are NOT huge fighting game creators?\"\n\n\nOne of the replies from Brodoof shows a screenshot from one of the Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown trailers. It has the same exact font, but the color is red instead of blue. This has led many to speculate the press mailing is setting the stage for something new in the Virtua Fighter franchise. \n\n\nImage via Sega\n\n\nSega could be planning a new Virtua Fighter with rollback netcode\n\n\nOne of the most important aspects of a modern fighting game is having a great rollback netcode. It lets players around the world battle it out and participate in tournaments online.\n\n\n\"I believe that implementing rollback will be absolutely necessary when developing future titles,\" said Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown producer Seiji Aoki when interviewed by Gamer Braves.\n\n\n\"While it’s important to create content for fighting game fans, I think it’s important to also create content that viewers or newcomers to the fighting genre can enjoy,\" Aoki said in the same interview when asked about how to keep the game interesting for both new and returning fans and how they're approaching the eSports aspect of the industry. \"For example, I can’t play soccer, but I love watching soccer.\" \n\n\nIt's just a waiting game now for eager fans to learn if Sega will revive the beloved Virtua Fighter franchise at The Game Awards. \n\nThe post Is Sega hinting at a Virtua Fighter 6 announcement for The Game Awards? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ready to return to the world of Halo? The second season of Paramount Plus' live-action adaptation just released a first look at CCXP alongside a February 8 release date.\n\n\nThe news comes a day or two after the streaming service launched its flagship show's first season on YouTube. Unfortunately, the date was leaked via the descriptions for a bit, so it wasn't much of a surprise. However, we got our first teaser for the new season and it looks to be a ride for sure. \n\n\n\n\nI Can See Your Halo, Halo\n\n\nIn the minute-and-a-half-long trailer, we see a bunch of wide shots and some action, and the epic scale does feel a bit more on par with viewer expectations. It's just a first look, so we can expect a better picture when a full trailer comes around. For now, what we got looks, dare I say, more promising than the first. \n\n\nDespite Halo receiving mixed reviews, the viewership was record-breaking for Paramount Plus, easily prompting a season two renewal. Well, that could be attributed to its looseness in the adaptation department. I mean, the show's first episode had Master Chief take his helmet off (and if you didn't last through that, he takes off more than just that). Personally, I hope the team takes into consideration the feedback from viewers and crafts a series worthy of its fanbase. \n\n\nHalo stars Pablo Schreiber (Narcos) as Master Chief/John-117 and Jen Taylor (Halo: Combat Evolved) as Cortana, whom we got to speak to last year. The supporting cast boasts the likes of Charlie Murphy (Happy Valley), Natascha McElhone (The Truman Show), and Bokeem Woodbine (Spider-Man: Homecoming), just to name a few. So, if you have time to kill, you can watch all the episodes free of charge via this playlist and finish the fight before February 8.\n\nThe post Halo Season 2 scores February release with new first look appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Amazon Prime has officially released its teaser trailer for the upcoming Fallout series, giving fans their first look at the latest venture into the post-apocalypse. \n\n\nThe trailer comes just days after the first look at the series via a Vanity Fair exclusive. \n\n\n\n\nThe first Fallout teaser trailer is a quick slice of life of the upcoming video game adaptation. Numerous Fallout mainstays are present, such as Vertibirds, Brotherhood of Steel Paladins, an uncannily charismatic ghoul, and a host of Vault Dwellers who seem to be going through a really rough patch. \n\n\nThere are also plenty of monsters abound in the trailer, including a pretty nasty-looking Yao Guai. In true Fallout tradition, the whole thing is set to a moody 1960s soundtrack. For the trailer, it's Nat King Cole's \"I Don't Want To See Tomorrow.\" \n\n\nPrime Video's Fallout series is coming in 2024\n\n\nDeveloped for Amazon Prime Video by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, Fallout is based on the storied video game series known for its tongue-in-cheek humor and dark storytelling. The Fallout series is a vivid take on a potential post-apocalyptic America populated by militaristic factions, irradiated monsters, and the iconic Vault Dwellers -- individuals raised in fallout shelters who are either the most capable or most clueless people in the room. \n\n\nThe first Fallout, released in 1997, was a groundbreaking RPG experience where players were a Vault Dweller seeking a water chip to save the inhabitants of Vault 13. Today, the series is perhaps best known for its FPS/RPG hybrid games, starting with 2008's Fallout 3. \n\n\nThe latest game in the series, Fallout 76, is an attempt at an MMO that has been met with divisive reviews and staunch criticism but is somehow still going strong today.\n\n\nFirst announced in 2020, Fallout stars Walton Goggins, Ella Purnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. The series is scheduled to be released exclusively on Prime Video on April 12, 2024. \n\nThe post Prime Video’s Fallout series drops its first teaser trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bullet hell shoot 'em up Shinorubi has officially fired off a release date and is now lined up for consoles and PC on January 12, 2024.\n\n\nRed Art Games previously had Shinorubi penciled in for \"early 2023,\" but clearly time is running out to make that cut. When Shinorubi launches it will be available digitally on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Those looking to pick up a physical copy will be able to do so on day one for PS4 and PS5. As for the physical Switch release, manufacturing delays have pushed that one back to Q2 2024.\n\n\nIf you've properly steeled yourself for a full-on eyeball assault, you can see just how hellish these bullets are shaping up to be in the launch date trailer. \n\n\n\n\nThe Deluxe Edition of Shinorubi, pictured below, is limited to just 300 copies per platform and available exclusively through Red Art's online store. Copies of the PS4 and PS5 versions are still available to pre-order, but the Switch Deluxe Edition is already sold out. There's also a Shinorubi Pink Edition for Switch, which packs the game in a steelbook case with a double-sided poster and soundtrack. That one is a little less scarce at 2,000 copies.\n\n\nImage via Red Art Games\n\n\nShinorubi marks the first release from the development team at Last Boss 88, who are, as you might have guessed, huge fans of danmaku shmups.

You will need to be a Prime Gaming subscriber to pick this up, alongside the other games headed to the service.\n\n\nImage via Bethesda\n\n\nThe December Prime Gaming lineup isn't that bad\n\n\nDeathloop isn't the only game being given out for Prime Gaming subscribers in December.

Like Groundhog Day, you're repeating the same day over and over, but as you explore the game's world, you'll find out more about the characters and the environments you inhabit. One plus is that you don't have to be hounded by Ned Ryerson every day.\n\n\nYou're also gathering intel on each of your targets while chased down by a (sometimes player-controlled)  rival. There's a lot going on in Deathloop, but it's an intriguing take on the tired genre. \n\n\nDeathloop won multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021 from outlets such as GameSpot and the Critic's Choice award from Golden Joystick. \"Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise to aplomb,\" our review said.\n\nThe post Prime Gaming picks up Deathloop in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

Activision has revealed skins for its operators revolving around the upcoming Dune: Part Two for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season One.\n\n\n\n\nNo date was attached to the announcement, but the models for the skins are shown. The characters Paul Atreides (Wonka’s Timothee Chalamet) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis’ Austin Butler) got revealed and they look… a little uncanny. They both look like they’ve had a bit too much spice, in Dune terms. It’s not known if the Oscar-nominated actors will reprise their roles, as other actors like Anthony Starr for The Boys’ Homelander or Nicki Minaj as, well, Nicki Minaj.\n\n\nDune and Dusted\n\n\nYou’d be right to be a little confused with the timing of the promotion and I don’t blame you. Originally, Dune: Part Two was scheduled to release on November 3. However, due to the Hollywood strikes, the sequel was pushed to March 15, 2024. The decision to delay the highly-anticipated adaptation came in late August, so it’d be too late to push them out of Season One. Still, it is weird to see the movie be promoted through, of all means, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.\n\n\nGranted, Dune is no stranger to video games. For promotion for Denis Villeneuve’s epic, characters Paul Atreides and Chani (Euphoria’s Zendaya) appeared in Fortnite back in 2021. Outside of shooters, Dune sticks to strategy-style gameplay, which is befitting of the book's political landscape. Last year, Shiro Games launched Dune: Spice Wars, which made it’s way to Xbox Game Pass just recently. \n\n\nFurthermore, the series is venturing into MMO territory by the folks at Funcom with Dune: Awakening. It’s a strange but nice time for Dune fans. Hopefully, Activision will include sandworm riding in Modern Warfare 3 as a vehicle option. If you can put Nicki Minaj in the game, you can also put in sandworms.\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S\n\nThe post Call of Duty MW3 is adding Dune skins as Operators appeared first on Destructoid.",

Those who played the 2010 installment, STALKER: Call of Pripyat, will be pleased to see Strider will be making a return for the follow-up.

For now, the new cinematic trailer should keep fans satiated for a bit.\n\n\nIt's been a trying time for GSC\n\n\nWe haven't had a STALKER game for a good while. Over thirteen years, to be precise. This latest entry was originally due for release in 2021, so a lot of people have been waiting a long time for it to drop.\n\n\nThings only got worse for the studio. Being based in Ukraine, the team had to pause development on STALKER 2 during the Russian invasion, with the company relocating to Prague to complete the project. Sadly, one of GSC's developer, Volodymyr Yezhov, was killed in action last December.\n\n\nAs it stands, development on the new game in the survival horror FPS series continues to be in full swing. It's also the first one to ditch the developer's own X-Ray Engine and opt for Unreal Engine 5 instead.

But now CD Projekt Red is adding Update 2.1 to Cyberpunk, with some features that fans have been asking for since the game was first released. \n\n\nIn a REDstream event hosted on Twitch, quest director Paweł Sasko and producer Monika Janowska laid out some of the changes that are coming in Cyberpunk Update 2.1 on December 5, many of which seem to be inspired by the most popular Cyberpunk mods. \n\n\nThe most notable addition to the game is a functional metro system that includes five different fully functional metro lines spanning the entire city.

          "description": "First we had the Wonka-inspired Xbox Series, and now there's something that should appeal to the Brit in me. If you're from good ol' Blighty and you like the idea of your Xbox or PlayStation peripherals reminding you of this fact, Yorkshire Tea may have the answer.\n\n\nWith a message that we should all \"press X to boil kettle,\" the famous tea brand has married hot beverages with gaming by selling PS5 and Xbox Series controllers slapped with the logo and that familiar imagery. These were designed by POPeART.\n\n\n\n\nWith the traditional countryside visuals and that bright orange background, any British person seeing these may feel a slight warmth in their heart at the mere sight of them.\n\n\nI'm more a coffee person, myself\n\n\nHowever, such warmth may not be forthcoming, as the controllers are priced at £150 each (about $190 US). Yorkshire Tea itself says the company isn't actually making money from the accessories. Another tweet says these are a \"small run\" and were originally going to be just a one-off idea. Then the thought struck to actually make them available to buy.\n\n\nIn any sense, it's possible that these tea-based controllers may not be around for a long time, but the company has said it'll be keeping an eye on what people are saying about them.\n\n\nGiven the price, it might be a wee bit off-putting to many of you. It's a nice idea, especially for those in your life who love tea and gaming. And now I can't stop thinking about that Yorkshire Tea ad that featured Sir Patrick Stewart. \n\nThe post Why yes, you can buy a Yorkshire Tea Xbox Series and PS5 controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Considered by many to be more than worth the monthly cost, Xbox Game Pass is the front-runner in gaming's fast lean towards subscription-based services. On top of Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer expressing interest in an Xbox mobile gaming store, the company's Chief Financial Officer is now keen on bringing Game Pass to... well, just about everything.\n\n\nAs reported by GameSpot, Tim Stuart said in a recent Wells Fargo TMT Summit (form required to access) that the goal is to one day bring the Xbox subscription service, as well as first-party titles, to \"every screen.\" This would also include on competing systems from Sony and Nintendo.\n\n\nImage via IGN.\n\n\nStuart is quoted as saying that it also means smart TVs and mobile devices, as well as \"what we would have thought of as competitors in the past, like PlayStation and Nintendo.\" Quite what these competitors think of this idea remains to be seen at this stage, but the report goes on to say that Sony previously blocked attempts to get EA Play on its consoles.\n\n\nYou can't move for bloody Game Pass\n\n\nIt sounds like a lofty ambition, bringing an extremely lucrative Xbox feature to the PS5 or Switch. Obviously, the endgame is to expand Game Pass as much as possible, and with Microsoft now owning the Call of Duty franchise, it has control on how it distributes these games.\n\n\nWith that in-mind, both Sony and Nintendo may have a vested interest in making sure CoD continues to be a mainstay across all major platforms going forward. In that sense, Xbox Game Pass being made available on \"every screen\" could be something big tech firms might consider.\n\n\nThen again, it could also just be another way Microsoft is continuing to gain a stranglehold on the prosperous video game industry. Time will tell on that front.\n\nThe post Xbox wants Game Pass everywhere, even other consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It won't come as a surprise to anyone considering the success Capcom has had with past Resident Evil remakes, but the company has plans for more. \n\n\nThis was mentioned by Resident Evil 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Anpo at a PlayStation partner awards event in Japan, IGN reports. He doesn't go so far as to reveal which title is up next, but he does state it is something that will be announced in the future. \n\n\nAccording to Anpo, Capcom looks to audience responses to gauge how it should tackle remakes. For this reason, the company is very grateful for the opinions fans voice, as it helps it to \"develop with the player’s opinion in mind.\" RE4 Remake producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi also chimes in on how the RE Engine has facilitated development. Things are looking to only improve with the engine, as Capcom has revealed that you can expect more from it, including greater ray tracing features and improved console performance. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nWhich Resident Evil game will get a remake next? \n\n\nNaturally, one would expect Resident Evil 5 to be the next game up. It's the third-bestselling title in the franchise, sitting behind only Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil 2. However, for players drawn in by the remakes, it may be a surprise to see just how action-focused the franchise can get. \n\n\nFans have long hoped for a remake of 2000's Code: Veronica, though the game has received a remaster before. Resident Evil Zero is also an option and you can also pick up a remastered version of this 2002 game. \n\n\nIt's a good idea to keep your eye on Capcom in 2024, as it has a few big titles planned. One of the first is Dragon's Dogma 2 which has received a March 22 release date. \n\nThe post Capcom confirms more Resident Evil remakes are on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember Ballance? I entirely don’t. But Ziggurat is pulling it out of obscurity (maybe) and onto Steam and GOG on January 5.\n\n\nZiggurat recently reproduced another game, Boiling Point, just this past November. But while I had a lot of things to say about my experiences with that game, Ballance is completely new to me. It was released in 2004 by Cyparade and Atari to decent reviews. It apparently wasn’t completely forgotten since it got a sequel in 2019 (involving none of the original staff), and even has a Wikipedia page. \n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of its Wikipedia page, it says, “The game is now considered abandonware, and neither the developers nor publishers are actively tracking its copyrights.” Not anymore! Purge your hard drives. It lives again!\n\n\nAnyways, Ballance is similar to the 1984 arcade classic, Marble Madness. It’s something of a puzzle platform where you navigate a ball through hazardous mazes. I guess, to use a more recent example, it’s a lot like Super Monkey Ball. It looks pretty fun, to be honest. Nothing in the press materials says whether anything has been fixed or updated in the new release. All the footage and screenshots of it show a 4:3 resolution.\n\n\nBy my standards, as long as it looks fine and runs fine, it’s good enough for a re-release. However, I am unable to confirm that it looks fine and runs fine.\n\n\nYou can find out for yourself when Ballance gets re-release on PC via GOG and Steam on January 5, 2024.\n\nThe post Ziggurat is bringing Ballance back on January 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There's barely time to breathe between Steam events and sales lately. However, if you have a virtual reality headset and are hankering for some pre-Christmas gaming, you might want to check out the Steam VR Fest next week.\n\n\nThe latest video on the Steam YouTube channel breaks down what you can expect between December 4 and December 11. There's not a whole lot that needs to be explained, to be honest. It's a Steam event. It caters to VR games. You know the score.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what's involved, the teaser shows off clips from games like Among Us VR, Star Trek: Bridge Crew, Elite Dangerous, Golf It!, and Tetris Effect: Connected. How you play a virtual reality version of Tetris, I'm not sure. But these are the times we live in.\n\n\nSteam work makes the dream work\n\n\nWhile these Steam events have been pretty short, lasting about a week or a few days, many of us are still recovering from the last one. The Autumn Sale took place at the end of November, and we still have the big Winter event to come.\n\n\nCan't complain, of course. I've got a laundry list of games on my wishlist that I wouldn't mind buying at a lower price. If waiting until a Steam sale is the way to do it, then so be it.\n\n\nPlus, with virtual reality still finding its footing in the market, the VR Fest is a great way those who have a headset to test out their hardware. I would get a virtual reality kit myself, but I can't justify the cost. Although, with Taskmaster getting its own VR game, maybe it's time to make the leap.\n\nThe post Steam VR Fest kicks off next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Despite this, leaks and reports from reputable sources have given us an idea of what might be coming. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to Schreier's reports, the game will be set in Vice City, which is styled after Miami. This aligns with what we saw in the major leak in 2022 which resulted in a teen getting arrested. The Tweet revealing the trailer's debut time also seems to hint at this, as it features a background with palm trees and tropical colors. Reports and leaks also suggest that we may be getting at least two playable characters, with one being the first female protagonist in the franchise's history.\n\n\nImage via Rockstar.\n\n\nA historic moment for gaming\n\n\nGTA 5 launched in 2013, leaving us with the longest wait ever for a new GTA title. The desire for a new title in the franchise is evident from the staggering amount of engagement Sam Houser's Tweet announcing the new trailer received. It has since been viewed over 183.3 million times and collected 1.6 million likes. \n\n\n\n\nPast GTA reveal trailers haven't failed to generate great hype. GTA 5's trailer currently sits at over 92 million views, and it holds the world record for the most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game. I have fond memories of GTA 4's trailer crashing Rockstar's site, causing people to flood YouTube where they were promptly rickrolled. \n\n\nNow that Dan Houser has left Rockstar, and there are reports that the company has had a change in its workplace culture, there's no telling how the next GTA game will set itself apart from its iconic predecessors. \n\nThe post Trailer for next Grand Theft Auto game coming December 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Microsoft's gaming division is seeking continued growth, and to do that, it is eyeing the mobile gaming market. As Bloomberg reports, Xbox is talking with partners to create a mobile gaming store. \n\n\nIn an interview in Sao Paulo during the CCXP comics and entertainment convention, Xbox's Phil Spencer highlights how mobile gaming is part of his team's strategy. Hence, they're \"actively working on today not only alone, but talking to other partners who’d also like to see more choice for how they can monetize on the phone.\" \n\n\nThis is not a new idea from Xbox. Spencer reveals that one of the motivations for the lengthy and pricey acquisition of Activision Blizzard King was the company's strong mobile gaming market presence through hits such as Candy Crush and Call of Duty Mobile. \n\n\nImage via Xbox.\n\n\nXbox's plan for global dominance \n\n\nAs Xbox has made clear numerous times, it is not purely focused on hardware sales, and it also hopes to maximize the reach of its subscription services. To do this, Microsoft expanded Game Pass to 11 new Latin American countries, and this has led to an increase in customers. \n\n\nAccording to Spencer, Peru and Costa Rica account for almost half the new sign-ups. He also highlights how important Brazil's gaming market is, as it is the second-biggest market for PC Game Pass globally, and he argues that \"in many ways Brazil leads a lot of the trends that we see globally.\" \n\n\nMicrosoft certainly has a lot of weight to swing around but it won't be entering an empty market, as big players such as Apple and Alphabet Inc already exist in that sphere. No date is given for when the mobile store will launch, but Spencer is certain that it isn't many years away. \n\nThe post Xbox in talks with partners to launch a mobile gaming store appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grinding Gear Games revealed the details for the upcoming Path of Exile Affliction league. It looks like a pretty big league overall with a slew of new features, content, and updates. The Affliction League itself adds the new Virdian Wildwood, where players can work their way through a mysterious forest to hunt down the source of the Affliction.\n\n\n\n\nThe Viridian Wildwood\n\n\nPlayers will encounter Sacred Wisps that beckon them into the overgrown passageways of the Viridian WIldwood. Over time the Wisps burn away the affliction that shrouds the forest, but the Wisps only have a limited amount of power. Once you return to Wraeclast, the Wisps you saved from the affliction will inhabit random monsters, increasing their power and rewards.\n\n\nOverall this mechanic feels like a mix of Delve with Sentinel. You'll progress through the Wildwood in a Delve-like fashion, where it's sort of an infinitely generated map. Then, you will take the Wisps back with you to power up monsters for increased rewards, similar to how the Sentinels worked.\n\n\nWildwood Ascendancy Classes and return of Ultimatum mechanic\n\n\nAs you traverse the Wildwood you'll complete quests to unlock one of three new Wildwood Ascendancy classes. Your chosen ascendancy class is in addition to the regular ascendancy class, which is the first time this has happened in Path of Exile.\n\n\nAlso, the Ultimatum mechanic from the Ultimatum league is being added to the core game. The popular mechanic lets players undertake Vaal trials for the Trialmaster in exchange for rewards. If you defeat the trial, he gives you the option of doing double or nothing. It was honestly a very fun mechanic that I've missed, so I'm glad it's being added back in. Of course, the mechanic has been rebalanced as it was a pretty powerful way of obtaining rewards in its original form.\n\n\nThe Path of Exile Affliction league goes live on December 8 on PC and Mac, and on December 13 for PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nThe post Path of Exile Affliction League details revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Mercenary class features shooter-like gameplay with the ability to swap crossbows and ammo types on the fly. Alongside the class reveal, GGG also revealed that WASD movement has been added as an option to PoE2.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mercenary is a brand new class that is coming to Path of Exile 2, and does not exist in the current version of PoE.

Now that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed its existence, we know that you will be able to move in a different direction than you aim and attack which is huge for an ARPG. According to the GGG, players will be able to switch between click-to-move and WASD at any time.\n\n\nI'm excited to see what other classes and feature reveals we get as we get closer to the PoE 2 release. Path of Exile 2 enters closed beta on June 7, 2024.\n\nThe post Path of Exile 2 shows off Mercenary class and WASD movement appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bungie is almost ready to bring Lightfall's long-awaited Fireteam Finder feature to Destiny 2. But players can get in on the action a little early, as stress tests have begun rolling out starting today. \n\n\nPlayers logging into Season 23 on November 30 were in for a treat. An in-game message informed Guardians they could participate in the day's Fireteam Finder stress test, as Bungie previously noted in a November 22 Dev Insights post.\n\n\nToday is the only day confirmed for stress testing, but it's the first chance players have to try Fireteam Finder out. Players can jump into Fireteam Finder's first stress test between 9 AM and 5 PM PST (12 PM to 8 PM EST) on November 30.\n\n\nThe experience is limited to Raid content, and, per the in-game notice, Bungie already anticipates the test could lead to some hiccups with game performance. That said, the pop-up also provided a method for players to report any issues they came across.\n\n\nWill there be another stress test?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nRight now, the only announced stress test is happening on November 30. That said, Bungie has already gone on to outline the path ahead. Following today's stress test, a Beta period will begin in December. \n\n\nBungie hasn't specified exact dates in December just yet, but that news will likely come after this first test concludes. Bungie did note in the Fireteam Finder Dev Insights post that the Beta's start would depend on how the stress test goes. \n\n\nFollowing the new year, Bungie estimates that Fireteam Finder will be ready for a full release in late January. This is, of course, if everything goes according to plan. And Bungie has promised to keep players updated on any timeline changes, should they develop.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Fireteam Finder stress test is taking place today appeared first on Destructoid.",

During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.\nThe metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to \"quality time\" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.\nAs stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms.

          "description": "After teasing that it would be releasing a trailer in early December about a month ago, Rockstar confirmed an exact date and time this morning. The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.\npic.twitter.com/BguwiJokQt\nDecember 1, 2023\nRockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is \"Trailer 1\" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, \"We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto,\" it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.\nThe art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.\nIf you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.\n\n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game. \nWhat do you want to see most in the next Grand Theft Auto? What do you think its title will be?

While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes. \nOff and RUNNING. #SonicMovie3\npic.twitter.com/BUIlurNIC0\nNovember 29, 2023\nProduction on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).\nWhatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.",

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. \nThe remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. \nAccording to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:\nThe store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” \n\"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year,\" Ubisoft wrote in the statement. \nBeyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. \nBeyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date.

Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.\n\nThe update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. \"We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up,\" the patch notes read. \"We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!\"\nThis is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle.

With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.\n\n\nThe collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit \"at a later date.\"\nGame Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024.

It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.\nThe film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). \nFive Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. \nFNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME.

The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us. \nFor more on Blumhouse, read about how the production company is creating a video game development and publishing studio. \nDid you watch Five Nights At Freddy’s?

A few years later, when an internet campaign pushed Community actor Donald Glover to play Spider-Man, the icon was chosen, and writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli created Miles.

          "description": "It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.\nIt all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.\nIn free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…",

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?\nAnd that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.\nHere's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.\n  \nKazooie (4/10)\nfrom Banjo Kazooie\nKazooie doesn't look activel…",

As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. \nHowever, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best.

And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. \nThe Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. \n\"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2,\" Epic writes in a blog post. \"Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET.\"\nWhile waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite. \nAre you hopping into Fortnite's Big Bang event next month?

Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack. Read about this live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project that's now in the works, too. \nAre you going to pick up Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.",

The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",
