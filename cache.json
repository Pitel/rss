          "description": "You be the judge.\n20 years ago, on 12th October 2001, the very first Ace Attorney game was released on Game Boy Advance. Although we wouldn't get the game in English until 2005 — when it was re-released on the DS — the Ace Attorney series has long been beloved by people all over the world.\nA large part of that is due to the loveable protagonist Phoenix \"Nick\" Wright, whose career journey from rookie lawyer to best-in-the-biz leads us through court cases where pretty much everyone he's ever known gets accused of murder at least once. Alongside other series favourites like Miles Edgeworth, Franziska Von Karma, Apollo Justice, and the Fey family, Phoenix will not only get his clients acquitted — he'll also unravel cold cases, expose long-forgotten crimes, and negotiate with terrorists.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now, we know what you’re thinking: you’ve seen the same thing said about countless titles over the years — what makes this one so different? We get it; more often than not, when a game is described as ‘unique’, you can probably identify at least a few well-worn tropes, and the same can be said with Disco Elysium: The Final Cut. This is a game that certainly features familiar individual mechanics, but when taken as a whole, there’s really nothing else like it in gaming right now.\nDisco Elysium has been around for a while on other platforms and chances are by now if you’ve seen any gameplay or commentary around the game, then you already know whether or not it’s going to be up your alley (which would also save us the unenviable job of actually explaining what the heck it’s all about). This release on Switch carries the subtitle ‘The Final Cut’, delivering what appears to be the definitive version of the game; but we’ll get into what’s been added a bit later.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Ultimate roster, and while he technically did make his way into the game as a Mii Fighter costume, the real collab actually ended up appearing in No More Heroes 3.\nAs those who have played the game already will know, No More Heroes 3 features a number of special matches which change up the game's usual formula, often taking on characteristics of other game genres or specific well-known titles.

You do so by engaging with gameplay which is one part pinball game, one part strategic RPG, which proves to be a surprisingly excellent pairing with lots of interesting ideas. The primary goal of each battle is to kill another giant crystalline monster, each of which is comprised of a series of interconnected parts with their own health bars. Only destroying one of these parts—the core—will kill the monster outright, but you often don’t have a straight shot or need to chip away at other parts before you can get to it.\nSkipper is given a limited number of actions per turn, and you then select from a menu of attacks that usually result in him flinging himself toward the beast and bouncing off its crystalline hide at high speed. You’re given an indicator of where is initial trajectory will go, but Skipper often bounces off several surfaces before coming to a stop. An effective turn, then, is one where you line things up just so that he hits several surfaces at once, but you also have to take his terminal point into consideration, too. Each turn, a red zone is marked out on the field indicating where the monster will strike, and if you finish a turn in that zone, Skipper takes a hit and loses health.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dread the scalpers.\nTo great excitement, Nintendo revealed its newest Metroid game during their E3 Direct back in June 2021. Metroid Dread was developed by MercuryStream, who you will remember from the excellent Metroid: Samus Returns on the 3DS, and the new game launched on 8th October 2021. We called it \"possibly the best Metroid game ever made\" in our review. It's good.\nIn this guide we've rounded up the various editions of the game available to buy in North America and the UK. In addition to this, there is also a two-pack of amiibo up for grabs, featuring Samus and one of her dreaded robot foes, the E.M.M.I.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Similar differences can make the genre hard to pin down.\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking that nothing could be simpler than working out the secret formula that binds all of the great games in this popular genre together — the clue’s in the name! They need to be just like Metroid, with all the shooting and the aliens and the sci-fi-ness and the quiet loneliness that entails, and they also need to be just like Castlevania, with its incredibly similar selection of… um, swords. And whips. And, uh, magic upside-down castles. Oh and its predilection for lengthy cutscenes that may feature characters who appeared once, a decade earlier, unlockable playable characters, and supernaturally beautiful men with gorgeous hair down to their knees too. Just mash the two of them together and sell whatever comes out the other end — easy!\nThat’s the theory, anyway. In reality the genre is a mad jumble of contradictions, the modern action leanings of The Mummy Demastered being just as authentically “Metroidvania” as Blasphemous’ gothic religious theme or Guacamelee! 2’s vivid style. A “real” Metroidvania can have you controlling ninjas, vampire hunters, whatever the heck Dead Cells flame-headed lead is… You don’t even have to be a hero (or a reluctant anti-hero) either — Carrion’s playable “character” is a remorseless mass of flesh and teeth, a violent thing eagerly consuming anyone that stands in its way, sliming down corridors and squeezing through impossibly small crevices.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The one in Impostor Factory is a secluded manor deep in the woods, a crumbling temple to cleanliness with self-cleaning floors and a literal golden toilet in the bathroom. You are the first to arrive, shoulders heavy with rain. You don't know much about the hosts, apart from the fact that they're old, eccentric, and eager to unveil the mysterious machine looming in the main hall. The other guests are as rich and quirky as the villa's owners, and you, an everyday man named Quincy, are starting to feel a bit awkward about the whole situation. And yet you stay because you're curious about the machine, the weird vision you had in the bathroom, and that other guest you keep bumping into - the lady in a red dress that looks familiar and sad and full of secrets. \nThe stage is set. The guests are gathered. The murders begin. And then they happen again, and again, and again. The real mystery is not discovering who committed the murders. The mystery is understanding why they keep happening.\nRead more",

I'm telling you this off the cuff because this is not, in fact, representative of my ten hours with Book Of Travels so far. Aside from my initial unwitting choice to spawn in a dangerous area, the Braided Shore is a serene world with a meditative pace.

Just this weekend, the game nearly hit a million concurrent players on Steam. But with that popularity has come long queues, and some players are going AFK once they get in so they don't lose their spots if they can't play immediately.
