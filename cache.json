The daily doom scroll might suggest that there's not much beauty in the world right now, but we're certain that's not the case, and the realms of media — interactive or otherwise — have been filled with wonders to help process the realities of a world that, at times, feels impossibly fractured.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I've played this year, I've set yet another new record for things I've played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.\nIn any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.\nRead more",

While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.\r\n\n\r\nNotable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's one of many mysteries that surround the edifice, which I discovered during a holiday in the Cairngorms this August, while everybody else at RPS was writing about some tyrannous entity called Gamescom.\nFirst, the approach: having exited a vast pine forest of primeval aspect and supernatural disposition, with distant, daylit clearings leading the eye deeper and deeper into the undergrowth, till it feels at last as though your gaze has become tangibly enmeshed with clutching root and lowering branch - having finally escaped from that terrible, terrible forest, with its single, mournful stream crossed by a bridge of predatory bareness that is surely a haven for trolls, you set out across a grey and purple oblivion of reed and heather, a moorland rising to the border between glens, broken only by the stark red stain of a door. Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster. What fell secrets could it harbour? Let us go and make our visit.\n Read more",

The last twelve months were bookended with the launch of two excellent VR headsets (although only one is truly relevant to us PC gamers) and a whole bunch of great VR titles. The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year. So it's an unevenly weighted set of barbells, the kind that would give our moustachioed muscleman a slipped disk. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I'm definitely here for the crash fixes - I can't get The Finals to run for longer than five minutes, which is a shame, because as Graham tells it, this is the most exciting new multiplayer FPS in years. Specifically, it sounds like a blend of Battlefield and Rainbow Six: Siege with a smashable toytown aesthetic. But enough about me and my computer's refusal to let me have fun.

Otherwise, nothing has truly given me the itch.\nBut I think 2024 could be a big one for me. Not only are a number of upcoming RPGs right up my alley, they align with new and existing motivations: hangs with pals and Japanese language learning.

Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. \r\n\n\r\nAs a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year.

This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too.

          "description": "It’s been encouraging to see how post-Steam Deck handheld PCs aren’t merely copying Valve’s homework.  The Asus ROG Ally made a (mostly) successful attempt at slimming down while upping performance, and now we have the Lenovo Legion Go: an even higher-concept portable with Switch-style detachable controllers. One of which transforms into a mouse. It’s a bit mad but I’ve always loved the concept’s ambition, even as I rendered working protypes a little less... working.\nI’m happy to report that this, the Legion Go’s retail version, is far more resistant to such improprieties. Moreover, it’s basically the best Windows handheld out there right now – though some occasional fiddliness, and the looming issue of the Steam Deck OLED, mean it isn’t necessarily the finest palmable PC outright.\nRead more",

That performance - and extremely modest power draw and a reasonable price - has caused the 7800X3D to become the best selling CPU by a huge margin according to a German PC part retailer. \nAnyway, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to drop in price. Recently we reported on a reduction in the UK, and now it's time for the US to get a turn on the deals train with a new asking price of just $339.99 - a full 40% off its US MSRP. That's a great price for a CPU that even comes with the breathtaking Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. \nRead more",

It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. \nOnce you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller. \nRead more",

Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as \"boomer shooters\" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.\nI reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.\nRead more",

You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? \"No.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

Arrrrgh. Hopefully Eiyuden Chronicle will ease the agony a little when it goes on sale on 23rd April 2024.\nRead more",

But plenty of new characters made our favorite games of 2023, too.\n\n\nWithin a single character, there's a huge amount of work done behind-the-scenes. It's not just design, or writing, or even direction. The actors themselves put themselves into it, and in a time where stabs at so-called AI are propagating at an uncomfortable rate, celebrating all the minds that make these characters shine is crucial, too.\n\n\n\n\nAt their best, a character gives the player a tangible, connective experience with a game.

          "description": "Rockstar is no stranger to leaks, and it seems the company can't even catch a break during the holiday season. \n\n\nIt has been reported that GTA 5's source code has been leaked. According to @GTAFocal, an account that follows all Grand Theft Auto-related news, the contents of the leak aren't new and originated from the massive 2022 GTA 6 leaks. However, until this point, the data had been shared among private groups alone. \n\n\n\n\nThough some have been brazen enough to post the content on Twitter, Take-Two Interactive is taking down links leading to the leaks. This isn't the first time Rockstar has suffered a leak this year, and just a few weeks ago, we had the GTA 6 trailer showing up before Rockstar intended to debut it. \n\n\nWhile it might be tempting to have a peek behind the curtains to see what's going on with the GTA developers, it isn't the wisest idea to provoke a company that has shown itself to be willing to use the full might of the law to protect its IPs. The teen behind the infamous GTA 6 leak in 2022 was deemed unfit to stand trial and has since been given an indefinite hospital order. \n\n\nWith a confirmed 2025 release date, it won't be long before we get more information on GTA 6 from official sources. As the reveal trailer has shown us, the upcoming crime game will be taking us to the state of Leonida which is \"home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond.\" \n\nThe post GTA 5 source code possibly leaked appeared first on Destructoid.",

I didn't know that I was missing her but it's abundantly clear that I was.\n\n\nIn a move that is both simultaneously surprising and not, Square Enix is licensing out one of its most popular characters. It appears that the puppet character, Nier, will have some competition in several ways.\n\n\nWhen is 2B coming to GBVSR?\n\n\nDuring Granblue Fes 2023, Cygames and Arc System Works announced the Nier: Automata star would be joining the fantasy fighter's roster in February 2024 as part of the Deluxe Edition Character Pass 1 or for $7.99 individually. In addition to 2B as a playable character, she'll also be usable as a Premium Avatar as part of the DLC.\n\n\nFor those who don't speak Japanese or want to sift through 6+ hours of footage, a post was made on Twitter (now X), including a 65-second video of the blindfolded battler. \n\n\n\n\n2B makes a rather stylish entrance with Pod following some conversation between the baffled Gran and Djeeta. She then gets to work with both the Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty swords before unleashing a Skybound Art with several Pod units.\n\n\nShe looks formidable with large sweeping attacks, quick-fire attacks from Pod, and teleporting dodges aplenty. I'm certainly excited to try her out as, despite not really enjoying Nier: Automata's story, 2B's design and gameplay completely won me over.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't 2B's first foray into fighting game territory, as she previously traveled back in time to fight against the likes of Nightmare and Voldo in Soulcalibur VI. She was a ton of fun to play then and her appearance in GBVSR looks to be a repeat performance. Whether you intend on playing her or not, it'll be wise to practice against her in the training mode as she's likely to be a popular pick following the release.\n\nThe post 2B is coming to Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising appeared first on Destructoid.",

I often say that game design doesn’t expire; it merely changes, but one common feature of ‘80s and ‘90s CRPGs is a wall of overcomplicated UI.

Head of Production Lance James confirmed the closure on Twitter as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Welp. That was a fun 10 year ride. The entire Versus Evil team has just been laid off. Let me be clear - this wasn't a Versus Evil decision or choice.\"\n- Lance James, Versus Evil Head of Production\n\n\n\nLegal issues between the two companies recently ended\n\n\nAccording to GamesIndustry.biz, earlier this month TinyBuild announced that it had settled a legal dispute with Versus Evil's former owner Stall Proof LLC. General Manager Steve Escalante and Head of Production Lance James were also involved in the legal dispute. In the end, TinyBuild paid $3.5 million and legal costs to settle the dispute, and Escalante left the company shortly after.\n\n\nOver a decade of publishing\n\n\nVersus Evil was founded in 2013 by Steve Escalante, who served as Marketing Director at ZeniMax Online Studios prior to doing so. In 2021 TinyBuild acquired the company as well as its QA Studio Red Cerberus. Over the last decade, Versus Evil has published very popular titles including The Banner Saga from developer Stoic and Obsidian Entertainment's Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire.\n\n\nIt's been as rough a year as I can remember for the games industry. This one feels extra cruel as we're just a couple of days away from Christmas and a little over a week from the new year.\n\n\nWe reached out to TinyBuild for comment but have not yet received a response.\n\nThe post Indie publisher Versus Evil has been shut down by Tinybuild appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Japan, Hoshi wo Miru Hito for Famicom is considered a kusoge no densetsu or “legendary crappy game.” One of the worst games of all time. It never made it to North America, but now we can share the pain, as a complete fan translation for the game has been released.\n\n\nThere had been a previous attempt at a translation made by modder KingMike, but it was never fully complete, leaving much of the battle text in Japanese. Last month, user Brandnewscooby released a patch for that patch, which picks up where KingMike left off and finishes the translation of the battle text.\n\n\nImage via Romhacking.net\n\n\nSometimes called Stargazer by Anglophones, Hoshi wo Miru Hito is an RPG that Hardcore Gaming 101 calls “hilariously embarrassing on just about every level.” The RPG genre exploded in popularity in Japan following 1986’s Dragon Quest, and Hoshi wo Miru Hito seems like a pretty blatant attempt at trying to get in on that boom. It does bring some interesting things to the table, including a futuristic setting, and managed to just barely precede Fantasy Star.\n\n\nHowever, every idea the team had seems to have been executed rather poorly. While considered to be somewhat charmingly inept, there are severe balancing issues and incredibly obtuse mechanics. The fact that English monoglots may now be able to understand the text doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to actually complete the game.\n\n\nIt was reported back in 2020 that City Connection was going to release the game worldwide, suggesting an official translation, but it only saw release in Japan.\n\n\nUntil we eventually get an official translation for Hoshi wo Miru Hito, you can find the initial fan translation patch here and the patch for the patch over here.\n\nThe post Legendary crappy game, Hoshi wo Miru Hito, gets completed fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

The hackers then released some of this information, with threats of publishing more if their ransom demands weren't met.\n\n\n“We’re both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it has taken on our dev team. We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other,” Insomniac's release says.\n\n\n\n\nThe statement acknowledges data involving “personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors.”\n\n\nHacks and leaks have been happening in the video game industry for decades. There have even been recent attacks against Sony and Rockstar, with the latter resulting in leaked development footage of Grand Theft Auto 6. Activision was hacked late last year, and it has been reported that employee information was compromised as a result of that, though the company claimed that it wasn’t.\n\n\nBut regardless of the company involved, I feel bad for the employees involved. I’m sure having development footage of a game that isn’t ready to be shown off yet is vexing and disappointing, but having HR documents stolen can be traumatic. Having them leaked on the internet can lead to horrible problems for the people affected.\n\n\nAs for Wolverine, Insomniac says that development is continuing as planned, and the team will share \"official information\" when it's ready.\n\nThe post Insomniac responds to massive hack: ‘We’re both saddened and angered’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

It has announced that it will be shutting down by the end of the year. \n\n\nAccording to the announcement from the studio, a \"lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll.\" Though the company wishes it could continue with its AAA VR projects, it has become impossible to justify the expenses. \n\n\nThis is notable news for the VR community, as Firewall: Zero Hour was a popular PS VR title that had earned itself good reviews. Firewall Ultra was released for the PS VR2, though it failed to impress players as much as its predecessor. \n\n\nEmployees have commented on the imminent closure on social media, celebrating their time with the studio while announcing their availability for new opportunities. They join the ranks of thousands of other gaming industry employees who have found themselves in a similar position this year. It has been estimated that in 2023 alone, around 9,000 video game jobs were lost. \n\n\nFirst Contact Entertainment isn't the only company struggling to master the VR space, with Sony also calling it a \"challenging category.\" PS VR2 players looking for first-person shooters aren't out of luck, however. The PlayStation VR2 has a few FPS titles available, with Pavlov being an unmissable standout. \n\nThe post Firewall Ultra developer is shutting down appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony has been testing the waters with different hardware this year, including the PlayStation Portal and the PS VR2. In an interview with the Financial Times, Eric Lempel, the head of global business at Sony Interactive Entertainment, reveals how some of these projects have been faring. \n\n\nThough Lempel states that the VR headset sales are \"going well,\" the VR category is still challenging. He argues that \"there was a higher expectation generally for what VR would do to gaming.\" Other hardware benefitted from the Black Friday sales period, including the PS Portal. According to Lempel, PlayStation enjoyed its most successful November ever in both sales and revenue.\n\n\nImage via Square Enix.\n\n\nSony is having no problems selling PS5s \n\n\nAs Sony announced this week, over 50 million PS5s have been sold. This, according to Financial Times, means the console outsold \"Microsoft's Xbox by almost three to one in 2023.\" Lempel comments on the sales milestone, claiming that with prior supply problems solved, the console is \"now on track to outsell PlayStation 4\" which has sold over 117 million units. \n\n\nReferencing data from Ampere Analysis, FT claims PS5 sales grew 65% while the Switch fell 18% and the Xbox fell 15%. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst from Creative Strategies, states that the divergences reflect differing strategies from the hardware manufacturers: \"Sony really cares about selling hardware but from a Microsoft perspective, it’s more about their subscription service.\"\n\n\nSony recently released a slimmer version of the console, and with the right line-up of titles, 2024 could be another successful year for the company. Fortunately, we have titles like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Rise of the Ronin to look forward to. \n\nThe post Sony describes VR as “a bit of a challenging category right now” appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some of our favorite indies that didn't wind up competing for that genre's award wound up here, as Slay the Princess, Cocoon, and BattleBit Remastered compete for a spot among PC greats.\n\n\nStarfield is competing here too  — there's no reality in which I'm playing that on consoles without mods, and it seems a lot of us are in the same boat. There's also Baldur's Gate 3, Dave the Diver, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on our nominees list, but Larian's brain tadpoles ultimately win here. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is Destructoid's Best PC Game of 2023. It's one of the games that, even in a year of heavy hitters, stands out as a must-play. \n\n\nOur review, handled by senior editor Eric Van Allen, echoes many of my own sentiments about the RPG as he praises its storytelling, visual scale, and strategic combat. I've spent more than my fair share of time troubleshooting it, especially into Act 3. But that I can still enjoy it this much this speaks to the quality of both what's already there and the continued update support from Larian. Even at its ugliest, Baldur's Gate 3 is a gem. \n\n\nI'm stuck in a constant loop replaying BG3, so it'll probably wind up my pick for 2024, 2025, and so on. The romances are just too good, and when I'm not poking around in Faerun, I'm busy modding it. Either way, thanks to the folks at Larian for pulling this together. It's a special game with a development tale I'm endlessly curious about, and I'm not sure if I'll ever play another like it.\n\n\n\nDestructoid’s Best PC Games of 2023, nominees:\n\n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3\n\n\nStarfield\n\n\nCocoon\n\n\nSlay the Princess\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\n\nBattleBit Remastered\n\n\nDave the Diver\n\n\n\n\nThe post Destructoid’s award for Best PC Game of 2023 goes to… appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is estimated that attacks on Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar have cost the companies up to $10 million. Per the BBC, Kurtaj expressed apparent unwillingness to stop conducting similar attacks. \n\n\nIt turns out that by the time he committed the GTA 6 hack, Kurtaj was already on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT/EE. The BBC reports: \"Despite having his laptop confiscated, Kurtaj managed to breach Rockstar, the company behind GTA, using an Amazon Firestick, his hotel TV and a mobile phone.\"\n\n\nKurtaj and another unnamed member of the Lapsus$ hacking group are the first to be convicted, while others are thought to remain at large, according to the BBC.\n\n\nIn July, Arion Kurtaj was deemed unfit to stand trial following a diagnosis of acute austism. The court then had the jury focusing not on whether Kurtaj had done it with criminal intent, but solely on whether or not he had perpetrated the alleged crimes at all.\n\n\nRegarding the mediate fate of Kurtaj, BBC reports: \"He will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger.\"\n\n\nThe news arrives just a few days after news broke of a massive hack at Insomniac, leaking details about in-development games and information about the studio.\n\nThe post GTA 6 hacker indefinitely sentenced to a secure hospital appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Did you know that D4 Enterprise is releasing Japanese PC-88 games on Switch? It hasn’t been going on for long, but I just learned it now, thanks to Hydlide. D4 has added two titles to their EggConsole lineup, with 1984’s Hydlide and 1986’s Silpheed.\n\n\nThe PC-88 is a Japanese home computer, similar to the Commodore 64 or Apple II. While we never got it over here in the West, it was extremely popular in its home country. Because of this, there are very few ways for Anglophones to really experience them. The fact that someone is porting games from the platform to Switch is pretty exciting to retro explorers such as myself.\n\n\nHydlide is an interesting, but kind of dopey, game that was ported to the NES but originally released on the PC8801. It’s an action RPG that predates both Dragon Quest and The Legend of Zelda. It’s a pioneer! Though, it’s also not a great one. Still worth experiencing for the historical context and its overall importance in the genre. It's the same reason you might play the original Ultima.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nSilpheed, on the other hand, is a scrolling shoot-‘em-up. For 1986, it feels so ahead of its time. It uses a lot of 3D effects and has some pretty rocking music. It was ported to other microcomputers at the time, got a semi-sequel on the Sega CD, and lived on through entries on the PS2 and Xbox 360.\n\n\nBeyond these two games, you can also find Xanadu, Relics, and Thexder already available as part of the EggConsole series. Each one runs for $6.49, which strikes me as a good price. The only thing to note is that parts of these games are still in Japanese, but it appears that all of the important stuff is in English.\n\nThe post Two new EggConsole PC-8801 games hit Switch today, Silpheed and Hydlide appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, after several years, not only has a new version been released, but it's caused the concurrent player count to spike to an all-time high.\n\n\nAccording to recent data from SteamDB, Geometry Dash reached a peak of 88,346 on December 20. If you look at the graph, you can see how it shot up in the space of a couple of hours, with the previous count showing just under 13,000 players.\n\n\n\n\nProgress on update 2.2 has been a long time coming. In fact, the last update from developer RobTop Games was in October, which said that the proposed November release would \"not be doable.\" Now that it's finally out, we can see just how much people have been waiting for it.\n\n\nBouncy bouncy\n\n\nFor those who haven't experienced it, Geometry Dash has you moving through levels of varying difficulties, playing as a simple shape or other object.

          "description": "No judgements here, but if you're a little embarrassed about some of the games in your library, there's now a solution. Not long ago, it was rumored that Steam would allow you to hide titles from others, and now that reality has come to fruition.\n\n\nIn the most recent update to the Steam client, it's now possible to mark your games as private. A post on Steam says there are \"times when you might want to keep a few of the games you own\" a hidden secret from others. For whatever reason you have.\n\n\n\n\nAs such, any games you now deem it appropriate to make private can be hidden from anyone who isn't you. This includes: \"your ownership, in-game status, playtime, and activity in that game.\" There's an FAQ that tells you how to go about doing this.\n\n\nIt begins at the checkout\n\n\nThe Steam patch also brings with it some updates to the shopping cart. Two new features have been added, which are:\n\n\n\nInline gifting - just in time for the holidays, you can now purchase gifts for multiple friends (and yourself) without having to make multiple purchases. Plus, gift messaging has been simplified to speed up the checkout process.\n\n\nOne cart across all devices - items in your shopping cart will now follow you across all devices where you're signed in to Steam. Note that during the beta, the cart will only be accessible within the beta client.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it also takes into account the new game privacy settings, by allowing you to hide them at the point of purchase.\n\n\nLook, I'm not going to go into any details here. We all know why Steam would allow users to not advertise some of the things in their games list. We'll just acknowledge that this is now something many will find useful and we'll move on with our lives.\n\nThe post Steam now allows you to hide your shame by marking games as private appeared first on Destructoid.",

During that time, it’s racked up a 90% positive rating on Steam. In a world where some games seem to be perpetual Early Access titles, It may seem like a short time for a game to be in that state. However, it seems to be right on track with what the developer was aiming for, allowing them to incorporate player feedback and add new features before launch.\n\n\n\n\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect is a side-scrolling roguelite similar to Dead Cells. The emphasis is on fancy, flashy combos, with lots of customization. I’m not super familiar with BlazBlue as a fighting series, but apparently, that’s not a problem. According to the store page (and also Steam reviews), the connection is largely an aesthetic one. It doesn’t tie its story or world into the established canon. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the lore. Weird choice, but it sounds like it works.\n\n\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect is currently available in Early Access.

According to The Verge, Instead of appointing a new replacement, the top Activision Blizzard executives will now report to Microsoft's game content and studios president Matt Booty. Several more higher-level Activision Blizzard employees will also leave the company in the new year with departures planned through March 2024.\n\n\nA lot of changes up top\n\n\nIt looks like the ripple effects of Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard will really go into full effect in the new year. In an internal memo, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer highlighted some of the changes including the departure of Lulu Meservey at the end of January and Humam Sakhini at the end of December. In March, Vice Chariman of Activision Blizzard Thomas Tippl will leave the company as well as Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, Chief People Officer Julie Hodges, Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton, and CFO Armin Zerza.\n\n\nEnd of an era\n\n\nAfter 32 years with the company, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's reign comes to an end. His resignation comes just two months after the acquisition of the company by Microsoft. After joining Activision in 1991, Kotick was responsible for several larger acquisitions in the industry including the Vivendi Games merger in 2008 that created Activision Blizzard and the acquisition of mobile game developer King.\n\n\nHowever, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows with Kotick. Just a few weeks ago his company agreed to pay over $54 million in a settlement with the California Civil Rights Department to settle a very messy workplace discrimination lawsuit.\n\n\nKotick will receive a farewell payout of at least $15 million when he leaves the company next week.\n\nThe post Bobby Kotick will resign from Activision Blizzard on December 29 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Takeyasu's company Crim purchased the rights a couple years after launch, and now the HD remaster finally has an April 28, 2024 date for Nintendo Switch. \n\n\nCrim announced the date for the port along with publisher Rainy Frog. El Shaddai will hit Switch both physically and digitally in Japan, including a physical deluxe edition priced at ¥8,250 (about US$57). Paying a little extra nets you the game along with a drama CD that comes with a script. Whether this is your first time ascending or you've been looking for an excuse to do so again, you can see more in the release date trailer. \n\n\n\n\nEl Shaddai made its debut in 2011 to somewhat mixed reactions. It's a uniquely stylized action game that isn't necessarily going to be for everyone, but those who vibe with it are probably still thinking about it today. It had a pretty big promotional and crossover push at the time, including one that saw Japanese clothing brand Edwin release some pricey 503 Zero jeans in both Enoch and Lucifel styles. Unfortunately, none of the Switch releases come with themed clothing, so you'll have to hit eBay for a gently used pair. \n\n\nOutside of the bonuses included with the Japanese physical editions, it doesn't seem as if there's much in the way of new content here. If good ol' reliable El Shaddai—complete with its rock, paper, scissors combat and blend of 3D and 2D sections—sounds like a solid enough hook in 2024, mark your calendars for April. \n\nThe post El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron HD Remaster makes Switch debut in April 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

For all the things that it does well, there's loads of stuff that Bethesda could improve upon, too. It sounds like improvements should be coming in 2024, though, according to the company's latest announcement.\n\n\nWork on the company's latest flagship appears to continue in the background. Many of its most pressing improvements have already been outlined in the days and weeks prior, but a few more precious details have just been provided, suggesting what else might be coming.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Bethesda's already confirmed some of the stuff that's coming to Starfield in 2024, such as new travel options, city maps, and a rough update cadence, there are some curious new tidbits present here. Specifically, the following:\n\n\n\nNew ship customization options.\n\n\nNew gameplay options that allow further difficulty adjustments.\n\n\n\nBethesda's not provided any detailed information on whether the team intends to simply add new customizations and difficulty sliders, or go all-in on the concept. A survival mode such as the one featured in Fallout 4 is something that players have expressed interest in, for example.\n\n\nBethesda's plans for Starfield in 2024\n\n\nFurther, Bethesda's previously confirmed update cadence, with new patches coming in every six weeks or so, won't be kicking in before February. This suggests that there's nothing new coming to Starfield in the next two months or so.\n\n\nOf course, Starfield's first confirmed expansion pack, Shattered Space, is still on the way. No date has been set for that yet, but the post says it's part of the 2024 plan.\n\n\nBethesda's end-of-year post outlining the near future of Starfield development could, therefore, either be taken with a dose of skepticism or hype, depending on one's opinion of what's already there.

You have 24 hours to claim it.\n\n\nI’ve heard of DNF Duel but know next to nothing about it. There was a lot of PR stuff coming at us in the lead-up and some excitement around the launch, but I think the fighting game market is pretty jammed up with heavy hitters to the point where it maybe didn’t catch fire. It’s a tough market for newcomers. It’s a spin-off of Dungeon & Fighter, which I also don’t know a whole lot about.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I hear the acronym “DNF,” my mind first goes to “did not finish,” and then afterward goes to “Duke Nukem Forever.”\n\n\nI do know something about the Epic Games Store. It gives away a lot of free games and doesn’t make any money for Epic. I installed it for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed and uninstalled it once that game came to Steam.\n\n\nDNF Duel does seem like a good time, though. You certainly can’t argue with the price of free. However, you’ll have to act now-ish, since the sale is only for 24 hours.

During his tenure, he worked on first-party behemoths like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Detroit: Become Human. But today, heʼs talking about a different type of testing involving a headset and physically mimicking movements for multiple hours at your office desk.\nIn games like Blood & Truth, where you take a starring role in action movie-esque setpieces, the fun factor of virtual reality quickly makes itself apparent. However, experiences like this can be taxing. A player can stop at any time. A tester doesnʼt have that…",

          "description": "When Final Fantasy X exploded onto the PlayStation 2 in 2001, it revolutionized not just the Final Fantasy series but the role-playing genre as a whole. The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.\nFor Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. \"We started off expressi…",

It said at the time that servers for The Day Before would remain in operation but that the game's future was unknown. Now, the studio has announced that it has officially ceased operations and The Day Before's servers will be turned off next month. \nMore specifically, the servers will be turned off on January 22, 2024. While the game has an emphasis on online play, it could still be played offline. However, on December 12, five days after the game launched on Steam, it was pulled from the storefront and The Day Before hasn't been available for purchase since. Plus, Fntastic says the game will be \"retired.\" \npic.twitter.com/GIX4ZAztny\nDecember 22, 2023\nHere's Fntastic's full statement on the server closure: \nThe Day Before launched into Early Access on December 7. The game peaked at 38,104 concurrent users at launch on Steam but today, that number is down to 55 players, according to SteamDB. In those four days, The Day Before also received enough negative reviews from players to place it into the 10 worst-reviewed games on Steam. \nOver the years, The Day Before has been the subject of controversy, ranging from requests for volunteer work, various delays, broken promises, and more. Fntastic has scrubbed its entire YouTube channel, leaving the following note as its channel's description: \"We're grateful to everyone who supported us during these difficult years. It's been a fantastic journey over the past eight years.\" \n[Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fntastic's statement said, \"Steam will not proactively refund all remaining players.\" The statement says, \"Steam will now proactively refund all remaining players\" and the story has been updated to reflect that. Game Informer regrets this mistake.]\nHave you played The Day Before?

After almost eight years as a studio, it will shut down at the end of the year. It cites a lack of VR support within the industry. \n\n\n\"After almost eight years of working with the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of being part of, I'm sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year,\" a Facebook post from the company reads. \"The lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll. As a AAA VR game developer, we are just not able to justify the expenses needed going forward. \n\"We are a team of fearless innovators willing to push new technologies to its limits. I am extremely proud of the team and grateful to our investors, our partners and of course, our community of dedicated and passionate players. It's been a wild ride.

          "description": "Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.\nSince the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.\n\n\nThe holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. \nThe milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. \nIt’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March. We're curious to see what else Sony has up its sleeve as the next year progresses.",

It posted images to prove the validity of its claim, demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Sony within seven days or it would leak what it had discovered, as reported by CyberDaily. Sony did not comply with the demand and now the group has released more than a terabyte of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac Games. \nThe total leak comprises more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, according to VideoGamesChronicle via CyberDaily. The leaked data includes information about Marvel's Spider-Man, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, and private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more. Game Informer will not be disclosing any of the hacked information. \nCyberDaily reached out to Rhysida and learned the ransomware group specifically targeted Insomniac Games. \"Yes, we knew who we were attacking,\" a Rhysida spokesperson told the publication over email. The group also told CyberDaily its motivation for the hack was financial. \nInsomniac Games just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle via CyberDaily]",

Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.\nApparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and a video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.\nRocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we've posted in full below. \nIt’s always a bummer to see leaks of this nature happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. \nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass. \nYou can watch the game’s most recent trailer from the 2023 Game Awards here.",

This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. \nBeyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's One Piece Odyssey review.",

When faced with the reality of having to become a studio solely dedicated to supporting a live service game or to continue making single-player experiences, it chose the latter. \nHere's Naughty Dog's full statement:\nThe Last of Us Online was originally intended as a multiplayer mode attached to The Last of Us Part II, serving as a successor to the first game's Factions mode.

          "description": "Marvel's Blade was one of the most exciting reveals from the Game Awards. Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.\nLuckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:\n\nConcept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.\nFor more Blade, check out our episode of the GI show where we recap the biggest announcements from the Game Awards, or just watch the reveal trailer again.",

The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.\nLike all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. \nIn addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release.

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
