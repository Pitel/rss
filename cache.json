          "description": "MythFarce.\nWith its bright, cel-shaded models and notably more tame environments, MythForce targets nostalgia for Saturday Morning cartoons from the 1980s like He-Man and Thundercats. A lot of people don't remember just how poorly a lot of those cartoons hold up, though. They have their die-hard fans, and they're fun to look back at with your tongue in your cheek and a drink in your hand as you muse about how easily entertained you were as a kid, but for most they're not much worth revisiting outside of a good laugh about reused animation and some occasionally fun character designs. Similarly, even beyond its horrendous performance on Switch, MythForce proves to be an uncompelling experience that hardly holds up.\nMythForce is a first-person roguelite dungeon crawler intended (though perhaps not designed) to be played in online co-op. For all intents and purposes, it's a pretty standard multiplayer roguelite; the entire game resets itself after you lose a run, and aside from incremental upgrades, nothing you pick up will stay with you in between runs. You can choose from one of MythForce's four members, each with their own special abilities, for each run.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It is, she points out, understandable why the sanitised Bethesda of today would leave well enough alone: \"2002's Elder Scrolls game is an overambitious, odd, scrappy, and spiky beast. It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck.\"\nYet, Morrowind is loved! And in the comments of that article Nic Rueben mentioned the demo for Ardenfall, an RPG with no release date but a Steam demo. So off I toddled to have a look, and though I haven't played much of it yet, I'm confident in saying that if you liked Morrowind you should check the demo out.\nRead more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year's Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a \"post-modern future\", designer Ben Friedman tells me. \nThe twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on. \nRead more",

CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while. \"It was a rough few years but there's finally celebration and closure (for me at least),\" posted senior level designer Seb Mcbride. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.\nTucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. \"To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game\" she says. \"I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used.\" She explains that \"a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that \"you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures.\"\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often.

This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy \"loyalty\" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you.

The old warhorse has certainly had some adventures, to the point that it isn't really a laptop anymore but a hovering debris cloud of plastic and metal, constellated by strips of sellotape, from which a moving picture may be hesitantly conjured by means of screamed insults and the careful deployment of desk fans. \r\n\n\r\nAmong the sicker jokes I've played on various editors as a freelancer is to review triple-A games on this sorrowing technological Igor, which - I swear to you - physically flinches and begins to whimper frantically when presented with any game more demanding than Far Cry 2. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I can run Ubisoft's forthcoming Assassin's Creed: Mirage on this hapless relic. The publisher have released minimum and recommended system specs for their latest historical throat-slitter, and they're pretty dang reasonable.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.\nFae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their \"failure\" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer \"production scale\" to attract and retain customers. \r\n\n\r\nIn turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, \"AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises\", while relying on \"rented\" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.\nBut is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.\nRead more",

          "description": "I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not \"Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen\" or \"wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke\" but \"person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot\". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.\nAn example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Overnight, in what Edwin called an \"unredacted document oopsie\" related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises \"Gaming\", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.\nAs is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3. I'm excited about that! But also fearful.\nRead more",

And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It's mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I'm haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I'm not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I'm alluding to my own in-game father, who's randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him.

We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. \r\n\n\r\nThe leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound \"hybrid\" Xbox platform, which will centre on a \"thin client\" OS that runs cloud-based games on “< $99”, \"consumer or handheld\" devices.

No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.\nEnter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man. \nRead more",

A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today's accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn't reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax's plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus.

Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.\nTo this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. \nThe winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the \"Hoarding\" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which \"hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood\". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.\nRead more",

          "description": "US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. \"What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time,\" the author wrote on his Substack. \"It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.\"\r\n\n\r\nYou might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In November 2021, they launched the double whammy of rhythm runner Hextech Mayhem and turn-based RPG Ruined King, and this year alone we've already had action RPG The Mageseeker and narrative platformer Conv/rgence. As you can probably tell, they're all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they'll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. \nI got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you've been craving another low stakes adventure that's all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.\nRead more",

The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!\nIt's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.\nRead more",

FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was \"fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. \r\n\nAnd yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun!

A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.\nTurns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.\nRead more",

After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur's Gate 3, it's almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang's behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson's Moomin books. Anyway, here's the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it's wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll. \nRead more",

You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.\r\n\n\r\nGunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.\r\n\n \nRead more",

No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. \nYou play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who's wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you're in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven't they?\nRead more",

As in, I play this all the time and I'm semi-embarrassed to admit it? \nA good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we've answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended.

Actually, that statement isn’t severe enough to reflect how bad the internet is these days, so let me try that again: being online in 2023 is a fucking nightmare. There are only three websites. They are all designed to make you angry because it’s the most profitable emotion. Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.\nBut it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun.

          "description": "Last November AMD introduced the first of the 4th Gen EPYC series with the EPYC 9004 \"Genoa\" processors and that was then complemented earlier this year by the July launch of the Genoa-X processors for sporting AMD 3D V-Cache to help technical computing workloads and as well launching Bergamo for the Zen 4C based processor designs that allow up to 128 cores / 256 threads per socket. While AMD has a very robust portfolio for the high-end server space with 4th Gen EPYC, today AMD is introducing the EPYC 8004 \"Siena\" processors for \"intelligent edge\" servers. Siena is a step below Genoa but still very capable offering and coming in at a lower price point while being geared more for maximizing power efficiency and opening up EPYC to more deployments outside of the data center.",

This was right as the video game market underwent a temporary implosion in other parts of the world and was strangely the best time possible for Nintendo to break into the home market. \n\n\nCollecting for a Japanese console can cause some hesitation for an Anglophone. The fear is that the best games will remain in their native language, and you’ll be left with piles of RPGs where you can't even navigate the menus. That can certainly be a problem as you get into later generations of consoles, but with the Famicom, there are a lot of great games that don’t require much reading comprehension.\n\n\nTo make things more tantalizing…",

It will feature five new games, including a sequel to the beloved Tee K.O. There's also a music-making game called Dodo Re Mi. You can now wishlist the game on Steam. \n\n\n\n\nThe selection of games available within the 10th Party Pack include:\n\n\n\nTee K.O. 2\n\n\nFixyText\n\n\nHynotorious\n\n\nTimejinx \n\n\nDodo Re Mi\n\n\n\nWe only know vague details about each game, however. FixyText is based on text editing. In a frantic group, you're \"typing all at once to make the most memorable statement,\" according to the Steam page. Something that will likely make the game entertaining is that you can't delete anything you write.\n\n\nHypnotorious is a hidden identity game. It's apparently a \"game with secret roles, tentative alliances, and of course silly answers to ridiculous questions.\" It may be similar to Monster Seeking Monster and Push the Button. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Timejinx is a trivia title that revolves around a time traveller from the future. You'll be trying to \"save your current timeline by answering questions about the past.\" It doesn't sound as deadly as Trivia Murder Party but seems like fun, for sure. \n\n\nImage via Jackbox Games\n\n\nLastly, Dodo Re Mi has your phone as an instrument. You'll be working together to \"escape the hungry jungle plant.\" \n\n\nThankfully, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 will be coming to all major gaming platforms, including PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, PC, and Nintendo Switch. We also know you can play the game with English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish language options from day one. \n\nThe post The Jackbox Party Pack 10 releases on October 19 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Success Corporation announced that it's currently working on a revival of the Nintendo DS-era RPG series Izuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja.\n\n\nThe news arrives as part of Tokyo Game Show 2023, though details are a bit scarce. The Izuna title is headed to Nintendo Switch and PC, and no window's been set yet.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer description says, per Gematsu, that the tentatively titled Izuna has begun development on Switch and PC with \"a new look.\"\n\n\nNo more info to go on now, besides the updated art of titular kunoichi Izuna. It's a rad design, at least.\n\n\nIt's all a mystery (dungeon)\n\n\nIzuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja was a duology of Nintendo DS games, developed by Ninja Studio and published by Success in Japan, that's been dormant for the better part of 16 years. Atlus handled the North American publishing for both Izuna games.\n\n\nThe Izuna series is a dungeon crawler, similar to the Mystery Dungeon style. You guide the ninja through dungeons, picking up items that could drop on death if you're not careful. Dungeons were randomly generated, and it seemed like a decent mix of exploration, planning, and battling.\n\n\nI certainly wasn't expecting a revival of a series like Izuna out of Tokyo Game Show 2023, but I definitely welcome it. There's a plethora of long-lost series from this era of games, and seeing any of them get a second shot at video game shelf life rules.\n\n\nNo word on when Izuna will arrive, but the kunoichi will get to adventure again on PC and Switch sometime in the future.\n\nThe post Izuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja is getting a revival on Switch and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

NIS America announced plans to bring Trails of Cold Steel III and Trails of Cold Steel IV to PlayStation 5. Those looking for a new platform for these will be able to pick up the two-in-one collection in early 2024.\n\n\nWhile we wait for a concrete date, you can see both in the announcement trailer: \n\n\n\n\nDeveloped by Nihon Falcom, Trails of Cold Steel III first launched on PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2017. Trails of Cold Steel IV followed in 2018, and both received global releases in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The turn-based RPGs follow war hero Rean Schwarzer as he becomes a new instructor at Thors Military Academy. He has to adjust to some major changes while getting Class VII ready for combat. The next entry picks up two weeks after the events of Trails of Cold Steel III.\n\n\nScreenshot via NIS America\n\n\nThe next generation of heroes\n\n\nWhile Rean gets his new soldiers in gear, he and his party will be able to sport the finest of accoutrements. The collection includes bonus cosmetic DLC so you can work on looking your best in the heat of battle. NIS America also has both a Deluxe Edition and Limited Edition on the way, and the latter is now available for pre-order. Dropping $99.99 will net you the games in a big ol' box with a soundtrack, mini art book, hardcover art book, cloth map, and postcard set, and art cards. \n\n\nFor those who can't wait for this port, Trails of Cold Steel III and IV are currently available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Trails of Cold Steel III and IV are coming to PS5 in early 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Larian says that the patch needs one more pass with the QA microscope before it’s ready, and will be coming September 22, 2023. That’s (checks watch) tomorrow.\n\n\nThe big feature of patch 3 is the addition of the magic mirror. With it, you can take a good long look at yourself. Where did these wrinkles come from? When did that spark of youth leave your eyes? The world has really done a number on you. Can you even recognize yourself anymore?\n\n\n\n\nAlso, you can use the magic mirror to change your appearance, voice, and pronouns. However, you can’t change your race or body type. You also can’t alter your origin, which is an unfortunate reality for many of us. No word on whether or not you can change your crotch cantrip, if you know what I mean.\n\n\nA tweet from Larian says that patch 3 says it’s “a big one.” I’m guessing that it’s going to include more than just the mirror. I mean, the mirror is a lot, but it is just one feature. Bugfixes are something of a given.

          "description": "Ubisoft has confirmed that Tom Clancy's The Division 3 is in the works, with Massive Entertainment leading development. The French publisher also announced it tapped Julian Gerighty as the new executive producer for The Division brand. He will dive into the new role once his work as creative director on Star Wars Outlaws is wrapped up.\n\n\nIn a Twitter post, Massive announced Gerighty's move to the brand. According to the announcement, he \"will oversee all games and products, including Tom Clancy’s The Division 3, led by Massive Entertainment who is actively building a team for the game.\"\n\n\nDevelopment on The Division 3 kicks off after Outlaws\n\n\nMassive is currently underway developing both Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws. The Swedish company, acquired by Ubisoft in 2008, is also behind the first two games in The Division franchise. Once Star Wars Outlaws is shipped, Gerighty will fully move into his executive producer role and help \"build a team\" for the third game. Until then, he remains \"fully committed to making Star Wars Outlaws a success both for the development team and fans.\"\n\n\nUbisoft confirming The Division 3 certainly isn't a surprise, with Gerighty casually mentioning that the franchise has earned around 40 million players. \n\n\nImage via Ubisoft.\n\n\n\"We may have over 40 million players, but The Division is still in its early years as a franchise,\" Gerighty said in a news release. \"There are so many incredible stories to tell, places to explore and people to protect.\"\n\n\nThere is some strong sentiment that The Division is here to stay and grow. With today's announcement, The Division 3 becomes the third game in the series currently in development under Ubisoft. The Division Heartland, a free-to-play shooter coming to consoles and PC, is headed by Red Storm Entertainment. And in case you forgot, like we did, Ubisoft is also making The Division Resurgence for mobile.\n\nThe post Ubisoft confirms The Division 3 is happening appeared first on Destructoid.",

Our very own Eric Van Allen scored Octopath Traveler 2 a 9 for its lively world, engaging combat, and fluid progression.\n\n\nIt's worth noting that while the announcement reveals Octopath Traveler 2 is coming to Windows, it's already out on PC via Steam.\n\n\nHere's the announcement trailer for the RPG coming to Xbox and Windows:\n\n\n\n\nSquare Enix and Microsoft relationship continues\n\n\nA couple of months ago Phil Spencer made an appearance at Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.

In fact, the original Octopath Traveler was actually on Xbox Game Pass for a period of time.

The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki received its official English title of Trails through Daybreak, and it’ll hit our shores next summer.\n\n\nFortunately, the title and date isn’t all we received today. NISA also released a new debut trailer that shows off some of the English voicework alongside the gameplay. Check it out below.\n\n\n\n\nA new starting point for Trails\n\n\nFalcom’s Legend of Heroes series has had quite a tumultuous history here in the West. The series is so big and so text heavy that localizations generally come with a bit of a delay. That’s honestly its own story that could fill several posts on its own, but in summary, fans have been waiting for this one since it originally released in Japan back in 2021.\n\n\nFortunately, during the Twitch presentation, NISA’s team clarified that Trails through Daybreak would also serve as a good point for new fans to jump into the series, taking place after Trails into Reverie. For someone like me who loves Falcom games but lacks the sheer hours it’d take to clear all the preceding games, that’s good news! I really enjoyed the recent English release of the spinoff title The Legend of Nayuta, so it’d be great to jump into the series proper as well.\n\n\nScreenshot via NIS America\n\n\nFor interested parties, preorders for the game have already gone live. A $99.99 Special Edition will net you some neat bonuses, including a mini artbook, a soundtrack CD, and a Steelbook case.

However, that doesn’t mean you’ll get the chance to control the hockey-haired ex-Turk. Square-Enix has stated in a Q&A posted by Game Informer that, while Vincent will join the party, he will be relegated to the sidelines.\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time a beloved Final Fantasy VII character got held teasingly out of reach. Red XIII joined the party at the tail end of Final Fantasy VII: Remake, but was unplayable there. It’s assumed that this is going to be a similar case for Vincent.\n\n\nThis choice is somewhat interesting since Vincent was popular enough to get his own spin-off in 2006 with Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII. I have to wonder if Vincent’s introduction will be made in the latter half of the game and if he’ll be playable in the final game of the remake trilogy.\n\n\nI don’t have strong feelings for Vincent, one way or the other. It’s been so long that I don’t remember my final party setup in my last playthrough of Final Fantasy VII, but I’m pretty sure Vincent wasn’t in it. That’s a bit strange since I lust for vampires, and Vincent has the look. I think what torpedoed my enthusiasm for him is the fact that he has no motivation in the original narrative. Then again, many prominent characters had no motivation for risking their neck. Buncha damned do-gooders.\n\n\nThe real question for me is if Cait Sith will be a playable character.\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Rebirth launches on PS5 on February 29, 2024.\n\nThe post Vincent Valentine won’t be playable in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the contents of the ESRB rating summary, the board may have revealed new freight delivery, No Russian-style mission.\n\n\n2009's Modern Warfare 2 featured one of the most controversial mainstream video game missions, where players opened fire on civilians in a terrorist attack. Though 2011's Modern Warfare 3 had its own take on the shocking sequence, the mission didn't receive quite as much attention. Since then, Call of Duty hasn't done much similar. However, as reported by Eurogamer, the ESRB may have just revealed that Sledgehammer Games has a similar mission planned for Modern Warfare 3.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIs Modern Warfare 3 (2023) revisiting the 2009 No Russian mission?\n\n\nAs for the specifics, here's part of the ESRB's summary on the No Russian-style mission: \n\n\n\"A handful of sequences depict more intense acts of violence: terrorists taking over an airplane; terrorists (dressed as police officers and paramedics) shooting/killing fleeing civilians inside a stadium concourse; airline passengers getting shot on a plane; prisoners shot inside a cell.\"\n\n\nThe new Modern Warfare trilogy has, granted, been fairly gruesome and violent in its own right. 2019's title, for example, featured a waterboarding scene among various other disturbing sequences. Last year's sequel felt a tad tamer in comparison, but it seems Modern Warfare 3 may revisit some of the series' most shocking scenes.\n\n\nCuriously, the ESRB notes marijuana use as well. The agency mentions a \"move in which marijuana smoke from a bong can be forced into an opponent's face\". There's also the usual language, blood, and zombie dismemberment, but none of this is out of the ordinary.\n\nThe post Modern Warfare 3 might be getting its own ‘No Russian’ mission appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s, um, not looking so hot.\n\n\nThe trailer starts off by telling us that Hotel Barcelona is written and directed by Swery65 and “original idea” by Suda51, which could mean any number of things. Considering the premise involves facing off with a series of serial killers, you can definitely locate Suda51’s idea.\n\n\n\n\nI consider myself a fan of both Swery65 and Suda51, but this trailer is kind of repellent. The graphics have this ugly blurry look that reminds me of a Wii title, the animations are uneven, and the voice acting is a little concerning. The gameplay looks a little routine, though the idea of playing side-by-side with your previous failed attempts is pretty cool. I’m interested to see how that turns out.\n\n\nAt least the HUD looks cool.\n\n\nTo be fair, most of Swery and Suda’s games are ugly. The actual gameplay an mechanics are typically a little shaky, as well. I prefer their approaches to storytelling, with each having the capacity to write extremely deep and unique characters. The trailer doesn’t really show Hotel Barcelona’s storytelling approach, nor do we see any real character interaction, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. It would be a real challenge for me not to play a Swery65 and Suda51 joint.\n\n\nHotel Barcelona is coming to Xbox, PS5, and PC sometime in 2024.\n\nThe post Hotel Barcelona, a new collab from Swery65 and Suda51, looks pretty rough in its new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

We'll still get the usual seasonal sales (summer is typically the big one), as well as Next Fest, in which \"fans can try out demos, chat with developers, watch livestreams, and learn about upcoming games.\"\n\n\nOver the years, Steam sales became a meme-worthy phenomenon, an event notorious for bleeding personal funds. You never really know what you're going to get during each event, but there's always something for everyone.\n\n\nMany of us have been long-time users of Steam, and even during times of financial hardship, gamers may still find themselves drawn in by discounted items.\n\nThe post Steam announces a bunch of sales and fests for early 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Developers received a nasty surprise when Unity announced that those who use its game engine will be subject to a runtime fee, beginning next year. This runtime fee will be charged monthly on a per-installation basis. \n\n\nPredictably, this led to a wave of complaints among developers, many of them small indie creators, pointing out how this change could affect their ability to profitably make games. Many also feel deceived, as the new system goes against Unity's previous terms of service. \n\n\n\n\nIn a show of unity (pun unintended), developers have been helping each other overcome this new obstacle. Terraria developer Re-Logic has played its part by pledging to donate $100,000 to the open-source engines Godot and FNA. Additionally, the studio will be donating $1,000 a month each.\n\n\nImage via Unity.\n\n\nRe-Logic takes a stand \n\n\nThe act of camaraderie is commendable, but it becomes even more impressive when you learn that Terraria does not use Unity outside of a few elements on mobile and consoles. Re-Logic claims this was done because a simple Tweet wouldn't suffice in this situation which affects so much of the gaming industry. \n\n\nThe studio hasn't held back with its criticism of Unity's new policy, claiming that the saddest part of the ordeal is the \"flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers.\" Re-Logic hasn't asked for anything in exchange for its donations except for the engines to remain powerful and approachable for developers. \n\n\nUnity has suffered a severe backlash, and in response, it has backtracked some points, and there are reports that a cap will be placed on the runtime fee. It may be a little too late, as some studios have already begun boycotts and disabling ads, including mobile developer Azur Games.\n\nThe post Terraria developer Re-Logic pledges over $100,000 to open-source engines following Unity controversy appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Given how Starfield cozied up to AMD, those who don't use Team Red's hardware may have had concerns about how optimized the game would be on Nvidia's tech. Fortunately, when it comes to upscaling at least, Bethesda is launching official DLSS support. But until then, the mod community is coming to the rescue.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Nukem recently released \"Streamline Native,\" which adds DLSS support to Starfield. It doesn't say specifically, but the DLL file download page suggests it supports version 3.5, which is the latest build.\n\n\nImage via Nukem/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nWhile there is already a DLSS mod for Starfield, this one by Nukem does something different by implementing options into the game's menu system. The above image shows the settings available natively.\n\n\nWhat exactly is DLSS?\n\n\nFor those who don't know, DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling. It effectively enables game visuals to be upscaled to a higher resolution using an algorithm, saving additional strain on the user's PC hardware.\n\n\nBecause DLSS is Nvidia's own tech, some may have been worried that Starfield wouldn't offer support for it. Bethesda struck up a deal with AMD (Nvidia's biggest competitor in the GPU market) which would see the game being better optimized for Team Red's products.\n\n\nFortunately, as previously mentioned, Bethesda is bringing DLSS support to the game at some point. But for now, if you want it now, there are a couple of options available in the modding community. However, Nukem's mod appears to be the first one to actually streamline it.\n\nThe post This Starfield mod adds DLSS options directly to the game’s menu settings appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're excited about Phantom Liberty and you're in the market for some new PC hardware, Nvidia may have you covered.\n\n\nTeam Green is currently offering a chance to win an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card, which comes with a custom backplate designed after Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a chance to win what is essentially the most powerful GPU on the current market, all you have to do, according to the post on Twitter, is like said post and comment with a specific hashtag. There doesn't appear to be any mention of how long the competition is going on or when a winner will be announced, so keep an eye on social media for details.\n\n\nAll those graphical gubbins\n\n\nNvidia launched its RTX 4090 graphics card almost a year ago, effectively kick-starting the next generation of GPU tech (with Nvidia naming its 4000 series after English Mathematician Ada Lovelace). \n\n\nAs the post on Twitter itself says, the 4090 boasts DLSS 3.5 – the latest in Team Green's AI upscaler – for all your visual purists out there. It's also, sadly, one of the most expensive pieces of PC kit available, so many of you will be eager to get hold of one for free.\n\n\nAs for the DLC itself, Phantom Liberty will be released on September 26, just a few days away. There's also Cyberpunk 2077 version 2.0 rolling out today, which represents something of an overhaul for the game. Developer CD Projekt Red even recommends starting a new save file due to how many changes this update will be bringing.\n\nThe post Here’s your chance to win an Nvidia RTX 4090 with custom Cyberpunk 2077 backplate appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nacon has published several games but these days it's more known for its gaming accessories. It recently unveiled the Revolution 5 Pro controller which is officially licensed by PlayStation. The controller is compatible with the PS4, PS5, and PC. \n\n\nIt looks like the DualSense Edge and it has many of the same features, including back buttons. You can customize the Revolution 5 Pro, as it comes with 3 sets of weights, 3 stick sizes, and 3 sets of stick heads to have the controller feel perfect in your hands.\n\n\nThere are some reasons why you may pick the Nacon over Sony's controller. Most notably, Nacon's controller features asymmetrical sticks, which is a preference for some players. It also boasts a battery life of over 10 hours and supports Bluetooth audio in addition to wired headsets. \n\n\n\n\n According to Nacon, this controller is geared towards gamers seeking maximum performance. It features magnetic Hall effect technology that brings increased accuracy and durability and gives you less reason to fear stick drift. \n\n\nThe controller is available in black and white, and it is set to release in October. You can pre-order it for $199.90. If you're looking for greater accessibility, you may want to turn to Sony's upcoming Access Controller which is highly customizable and catered towards players with varying needs. \n\nThe post Nacon announces new PS5 controller, the Revolution 5 Pro appeared first on Destructoid.",

Over the years, there have been plenty of reports of parents hit with breathtakingly high bills after a child goes on a Fortnite spending spree. Anyone who's faced such a situation may be able to claim a refund thanks to a ruling by the Federal Trade Commission. \n\n\nThe FTC unveiled this refund process after Fortnite developer Epic Games agreed to pay a colossal $245 million settlement following accusations of charging for unwanted purchases and locking the accounts of customers who disputed the charges with their credit card companies. Since September 19, the FTC has been sending out emails to Fortnite players who may be eligible for a refund.\n\n\nAny US citizens who have had unwanted purchases have until January 17 to claim a refund. At least one of these statements also have to be true: \n\n\n\nYou were charged in-game currency for items you didn’t want between January 2017 and September 2022\n\n\nYour child made charges to your credit card without your knowledge between January 2017 and November 2018\n\n\nYour account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after you complained to your credit card company about wrongful charges\n\n\n\nImage via Epic Games.\n\n\nFortnite's dubious practices\n\n\nFornite has been accused of predatory practices and \"dark patterns\" meant to coerce players into making purchases. The $245 million settlement will go to consumers who have fallen victim to these tactics. The FTC has yet to reveal how much affected players will be refunded, but it \"will depend on several factors, including how many people file a claim.\"\n\n\nDespite the setback, Fortnite is still going strong. This month, it began yet another anime collaboration, this time with My Hero Academia. \n\nThe post You may be eligible for a refund if you’ve had unwanted Fortnite purchases appeared first on Destructoid.",

Things haven't been looking good for its studios lately, as they have been suffering from layoffs and closures. \n\n\nThe next studio to meet this fate is Crystal Dynamics which is the team behind the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy. It is currently developing the next Tomb Raider game which will be published by Amazon.\n\n\n\n\nOn Twitter, the studio announced that it had to part ways with nine brand/marketing employees, as well as an IT employee. According to LinkedIn, the studio has 201 to 500 employees. Crystal Dynamics states that the difficult choice was made to align the studio with its current business needs. \n\n\nSome of the ex-employees affected by the layoffs have identified themselves (as Eurogamer reports), including senior brand manager Nicholas Edwards who revealed on LinkedIn that he is no longer working at Crystal Dynamics. \n\n\nImage via Embracer Group.\n\n\nEmbracer Group is changing its business strategy\n\n\nEmbracer Group had been on a buying spree, but that has come to a halt. As revealed in an open letter, it is now focused on becoming a highly cash-flow generative business. The consequence of this has been the closure of studios like Volition and layoffs in studios such as Beamdog. \n\n\nIt appears that not even Embracer's biggest studios are safe, as there have been reports of the company showing interest in selling off Gearbox, the studio behind Borderlands. This leaves us with uncertainty regarding all of Embracer's studios. \n\nThe post Crystal Dynamics cuts staff as Embracer Group studio layoffs continue appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Octopath Traveler II is one of the year’s most celebrated RPGs, and now Xbox fans have been invited to join the party. The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.\nThe RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. \nIn the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. \nAssassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer. \nAre you going to check out Assassin's Creed Nexus VR in November?

Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed \"to ensure thorough testing.\" This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.\nWhile we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. \nWith Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!\npic.twitter.com/LJ6y9CZ58F\nSeptember 21, 2023\nEven though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.",

          "description": "In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.\nThe other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.\nI played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.\n\n\nThe anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.",

          "description": "Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.\nFirst up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.\n\n\nSome details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.\n\nAlongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.\n\n\nArguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.\nAlongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.",

The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.\nIn a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. \nEvil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, \"It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced.\" You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

          "description": "Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. \nThe leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. \nWe've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.\nSeptember 19, 2023\nHe shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: \nSomething of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share \"the real plans\" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.\n[Source: The Verge]",

One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before.

The big news is that the update is coming this winter.\n\n\nMore immediately, we finally got confirmation that \"Separate Ways\" is coming to RE4.

Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.\nMoreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.\nFor more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified \"Separate Ways\" as \"Assignment Ada.\" We regret the error.",

Ultimate roster. \nAll five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. \nThe Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. \nAnd finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. \nWhile waiting to get each, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer's review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3.

          "description": "Bloomberg reports that two Unity Technologies Inc. offices closed today following a \"credible death threat\" amidst ongoing controversy regarding a new per-install fee implemented for developers using Unity. The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. \nTwo days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players' ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. \nUnity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company's Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.\n [Source: Bloomberg]",

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",

These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports.
