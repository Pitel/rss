          "description": "\"Collaboration contents from outside Capcom will not be carried over\".\nThe Nintendo 3DS had plenty of incredible exclusives and in its heyday, a lot of those were in the Monster Hunter series. One gem that truly stands out from its no-glasses-3D siblings is Monster Hunter Stories. Developed as a collaboration between Capcom and Marvelous, this turn-based RPG was quite a massive departure in comparison to anything that's come before and is highly regarded by those that did play it. However, Stories was overlooked by many at the time as it was dealt the unfortunate hand of launching six months after the console that would replace the 2DS and 3DS, the Nintendo Switch.\nFlash forward to the year 2024, and not only has a Switch sequel to Stories released, but that first game that fans loved so much is finally making its way to Switch, too. We had the chance to send off a few questions to the Monster Hunter Stories team at Capcom and the game's producer, Yoshihiro Akira, was kind enough to give us his insight on the game's co-development with Marvelous, 3DS-exclusive features, and what it's like bringing this game to a new audience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Remaking money.\nAs Nintendo's internal software focus has switched to games for its as-yet-unannounced hardware, we've been enjoying a wave of lower-key ports, remakes, and remasters over the last year or so, in addition to the tentpole TOTKs and Mario Wonders of the world. The sun may be slowly setting on Switch, but quality revisits such as Metroid Prime Remastered, Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario: TTYD hardly feel like stop-gaps. Even less exciting games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong and the upcoming Luigi's Mansion 2 HD represent hearty late-gen fare, especially for players who never played the originals.\nStill, if you are a returning player, you might be looking at the price tag for these games and raising an eyebrow.

Of course, it absolutely should do for 300 bucks, but looking at the myriad details crammed into the 2500-piece set — which covers both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild incarnations of the ancient tree — the care and attention that's gone into this latest Nintendo-themed Lego creation is obvious.\nEschewing the innovative play features of the course-based Lego Super Mario line, this build carries an 18+ age recommendation so it's clearly targeting a different demographic from the Mario or Animal Crossing sets. Those are great, but for adults it's perhaps more exciting to see larger builds and pieces meant equally for display in addition to play.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.\n \nRead more",

Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do.

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen \"thecatamites\" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.\nRead more",

Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains.

I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Tato melodie byla vyhodnocena jako porušení autorských práv, protože se shoduje s nahrávkou od uživatele Audego starou devět let. Což je vlastně přesně nahraná melodie pračky Samsung. Ke klipu však Audego připojil Content ID, tedy označil jej za vlastní výtvor.",

Not in terms of basic stuff, like genre or developer or \"it plays like X meets Y.\" Those are fairly easy to tack down. No, it's the next layer down that has had me thinking a lot about Centum since I hit the end of its preview build: the how and why.\n\n\nSo let's start with the easy parts. Centum is a narrative adventure, largely falling within the point-and-click genre, from developer Hack The Publisher and publisher Serenity Forge. Most of its gameplay consists of interacting with objects, selecting dialogue choices, and unlocking new interactions through flowchart-like experimentation. Move an object, find a new thing to put in your inventory, test it out on all the other interactable spots on-screen. If you've e…",

As you might have guessed from the name, it's giving serious Tatsuki Fujimoto Before Chainsaw Man vibes and will surely give a look inside the creations of Endo before the release of the popular Spy x Family manga. \n\n\n\n\nLike Tatsuki Fujimoto Before Chainsaw Man, Viz Media will be publishing the Tatsuya Endo collection. As of just a couple of months ago, the Spy x Family manga had over 35 million copies in circulation making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.\n\n\nFollowing Viz Media's tweet that confirmed the collection would be dark and gritty, fans have already started drawing comparisons to TISTA, a 2007 series by Endo that followed a young assassin named Tista Rockwell. If you've not seen it, it may be hard to picture Endo getting overly dark and gritty, but if you've seen TISTA, you know it's certainly in his wheelhouse.\n\n\nFour Lives Remain: Tatsuya Endo Before Spy x Family will be released in Spring 2025.\n\nThe post A one-shot collection from Spy x Family author Tatsuya Endo is coming this spring appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Mythical quality unit requires an evolution to be acquired, which can be tricky to figure out. Here is how to get the Elf Wizardess unit in Anime Defenders through evolution.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get Elf Wizardess\n\n\nThe Elf Wizardess is a Mythical quality unit that can only be acquired via Trading with other players or Summoning from the Summon Circle. Mythical units are extremely rare and you only have about a 0.5% chance of summoning one when using the Summon circle. It costs 50 Gems to do a single summon, or 500 Gems to summon 10 at a time, so the cost for trying to get the Elf Wizardess can stack up pretty quickly.\n\n\nThe Elf Wizardess is an extremely powerful unit with the potential to evolve into the even stronger Elf Hero Here are the Wizardess stats:\n\n\n\nHow to obtain: 0.5% chance to Summon\n\n\nEvolves into: Elf Hero\n\n\nDeployment Cost: 11,350\n\n\nTotal Upgrade Cost: 64,750 over 11 upgrades\n\n\nAttack Patterns:\n\nLevel 1-5 – Ground Flame Line\n\n\nLevel 6-7 – Destructive Lightning\n\n\nLevel 8-11 – Circle AoE\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to evolve into Elf Hero\n\n\nYou can get the Elf Hero unit by using 3 Flame Grimoire items to evolve the Mythical quality Elf Wizardess unit. Once you've crafted 3 Flame Grimoire's at the Crafting Circle in the Summon shop at the main hub, you can then head to the Evolve Circle in the same shop to complete the evolution. Use the three Flame Grimoire's and you can evolve your Elf Wizadess into the Elf Hero.\n\n\nIn order to craft each Flame Grimoire you need the following materials:\n\n\n\n8,500 Gold\n\n\n3 Blue Star Rifts\n\n\n3 Red Star Rifts\n\n\n3 Green Star Rifts\n\n\n3 Purple Star Rifts\n\n\n1 Rainbow Star Rift\n\n\nThe post How to get Elf Wizardess in Anime Defenders appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Toys for Bob has announced via Twitter that they’ve teamed up with Microsoft for their next new game. There’s no word on what that next new game will be, but their choice of partner is… quite the choice.\n\n\n\n\nToys for Bob was originally a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard and, along with them, were bought up by Microsoft in 2023. It was only a few months before Microsoft went to work laying of 1,900 employees, including some that were at Toys for Bob, leaving the developer’s survival in question. Subsequently, Toys for Bob was able to split from the newly acquired Activision and set out on their own.\n\n\nSince then, Microsoft has shuttered Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, while absorbing Roundhouse Studios into ZeniMax Online.\n\n\nI consider myself to be a forgiving person, but I’m confused that the studio is so eager to partner with their former existential threat. I shouldn’t be too surprised because, at the time of their split, Toys for Bob said in a statement that they were looking into a possible partnership with Microsoft. It may have been a part of the deal that allowed them to separate. Or perhaps they are working on a property owned by Microsoft. Or maybe they feel it’s a safe partnership because Microsoft no longer has the power to lay off their staff.\n\n\nToys For Bob most recently worked on the Skylanders series, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. It’s possible that the developer is looking to return to one of those licenses, which would necessitate a deal with Microsoft. However, that’s purely speculation trying to make sense of the matter. We won’t know until the project is revealed. According to the Tweet, “We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more.”\n\nThe post Toys for Bob partners with Xbox to publish its next game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Diablo 4's best new endgame addition, The Pit, is a twist on Diablo 3's Greater Rift formula. These procedural, randomized dungeons reward you with the items necessary for masterworking gear, so they're essential if you want to push a build to its limits. You'll just need one thing before you head in: Runeshards. \n\n\nIt takes three Runeshards to enter the Pit at any tier, so stockpiling these should be in the back of your mind while doing other content. They drop from Nightmare Dungeons of tier 46 or higher, Tree of Whispers Caches, Legion Events, and World Bosses. As for farming these, here's my preferred method.\n\n\nFarming Runeshards in Diablo 4\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe quickest way I've found to farm Runeshards is to blitz through the lowest Nightmare Dungeon tier that drops them: tier 46. At the Occultist, you can craft Nightmare Dungeon Sigils of varying levels, which works (almost) perfectly for our farming method. \n\n\nTo get started, simply craft level 41-50 Sigils and save the ones between 46 and 50 while salvaging the rest. As you complete these dungeons, you'll be rewarded with Sigils of similar quality. If you're blasting even higher Nightmare Dungeons, go ahead and do those so you can level you Paragon Glyphs quicker as well.\n\n\nOne tier 46 Nightmare Dungeon nets you the three Runeshards you'll need for a single Pit run. If you get burnt out on dungeons, you can try blasting the Helltide for a bit and completing the Tree of Whispers bounties inside for a cache that will also net you at least three Runeshards. If you alternate these activities while keeping an eye on Legion and World Boss timers, you'll have a stockpile of shards before you know it. \n\nThe post How to get Runeshards in Diablo 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.\nThe studio states its new title is \"very early in development\" and that we won't see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn't surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.\nWe're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about!

The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series. \nYou can read our review of Toys for Bob's most recent release, Crash Team Rumble, here.",

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.",

In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. \nThe trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6.

A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: \"You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.\"\nIn addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. \nBallad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.",

          "description": "PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal? Let us know in the comments below!",

Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.\nDragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.",

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far?

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.\nYou can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.\n\n\nHive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.",

With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community.

The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.\nFirst introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. \n\n\nLidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters.

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",
