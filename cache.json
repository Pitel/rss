          "description": "It's not a birthday, it's a 1-Up.\nBack when Mario was nothing more than an 8-bit sprite on our NES consoles, we were not all that concerned about age. After all, he's the jumpy mushroom guy, who cares how many birthdays he's seen? This is the kind of mentality that's been carried through into most of the subsequent games. Even as the character's design became increasingly detailed, his age wasn't at the forefront of our minds because we had other, gameplay-based things to think about. But now that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is here, all of a sudden, we care.\nNo longer is Mario just a character that we control, but we've seen another side to him thanks to Illumination and Nintendo's film. We've seen that has a life of his own outside of the games. With this comes questions that we might not have asked after playing, say, Super Mario Odyssey: what are his hobbies? Does he have any dreams? And, most importantly, just how old is this guy?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But that hasn't stopped there from being some questions that need answering, such as, how on Earth do those brick blocks float?\nFortunately, one of the film's directors, Aaron Horvath, has offered an explanation for that very topic in a recent interview with Variety, and it's all thanks to an in-universe substance called \"Floatanium\" (thanks, Go Nintendo).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But something is different this time. Instead of playing the game with the conventional analogue stick and button inputs, you whack your Wii Remote into a white plastic wheel and swerve around the track by actually steering.\nMario Kart Wii turns 15 today and, for many of us, these controls are still looked back on fondly. Playing Mario Kart with motion controls felt like groundbreaking stuff back in 2008. No longer were we simply playing a driving game, we were actually driving. Collectively, we gripped the wheel at ten and two, leant into corners while sitting in our armchairs, and made every jump count by swiftly lifting the controller in the air in mimicry of the on-screen takeoff. It was brilliant.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.\nToday both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. \r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.\r\n\n\r\nAfter spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. \r\n\n\r\nBut for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.\nIn Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.\nRead more",

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.\nI recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.\nRead more",

She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.\nSaying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.\nYou can listen and subscribe via your podcast provider of choice!

The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going \"full pipe\" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. \nBut also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  \n\"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'\" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a \"national treasure\" and \"mandatory reading in high school\" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's \"had to deal with\" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this \"isn't a one-to-one adaptation\" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.\nRead more",

After three long years of development, Crab Champions was finally launched - on April 1st this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you.

I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.\nIt's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.\nRead more",

Let’s get into some good words, shall we?\nWired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.\nHis time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”\n Read more",

The office (by which I mean our Slack channel) was cold and empty, and a shining beacon of light rose from my monitor screen and proclaimed that I was now an honourary Alice. And as such, the heavy responsibility of compiling everyone's weekend gaming plans fell to me. To entertain myself (and force those who left me in charge to think twice), I'll be writing a series of unhinged 90s-style \"where are they now?\" epilogues in italics for each person who neglected to send me words of their own.\nRead more",

          "description": "The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. \nLuckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.\nRead more",

          "description": "With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he's ever been from home, I recently realised that it'll soon be the longest we've gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.\nI suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?\nRead more",

This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. \r\n\n\r\nWindy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”\r\n \nRead more",

Already with the Linux kernel patches Intel is carrying at the moment via their in-house distribution, there are some significant benefits for Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids.

          "description": "The fan event will take place in the U.S. for the first time\nNintendo is bringing its Live celebration to Seattle. The company has announced that Nintendo Live 2023 is heading to Seattle, Washington sometime this September.\nPrevious events have been held in Japan, but this Live event is heading to the U.S. this time. The in-person event will host gameplay, live stage shows, tournaments, photo opportunities, and more.\nFor this Seattle event, Nintendo says there will be a \"large-scale themed area\" for all ages, with the experience designed with \"both families and fans\" in consideration.\nMore details, including the exact timing and location, will be shared sometime in the future.\nVia the Nintendo site, there will be opportunities to play games with friends or at your own pace. Or you can watch some competitions in unspecified games, take pics with Nintendo characters, or check out sculptures that bring those worlds to life.\nFor a better idea of what's in store, here's the Animal Crossing x Splatoon live concert from Nintendo Live 2022.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ETszC6w-mg\nNintendo's party\nSo yes, it's a big Nintendo fan event held in Seattle. It's probably worth keeping expectations in check for this being some kind of E3 show, as this is usually a more fan-focused affair. Music? Gameplay? Tournaments? All still there.\nMeanwhile, the summer of games is adjusting to a world without E3, as the ESA is skipping the festivities this year. Nintendo wasn't planning on going, but also hasn't locked in any Directs around that time as of writing. Granted, the company is coming off a big movie debut, and gearing up for the launch of Tears of the Kingdom. Hopefully we'll hear more about any summer streaming plans soon.\nThe post Nintendo Live 2023 is heading to Seattle this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One Shot, Five Kills, apparently\nA Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) player has been making waves among the community with a video of an amazing play in which they defeated the entire opposing team with one single bullet.\nThe video, which was shared online by FullSquadGaming's Jake Lucky, sees player sp1cay achieve the momentous Ace just seconds into a fresh round of Bomb Defusal. Double-timing to a popular charge corridor on the \"Inferno\" map, sp1cay tosses a flash to cover his approach before switching to the powerful AWP sniper rifle, noticing movement, sp1cay fires off a single round which, in a moment worthy of Tom Berenger, (or I guess John Wick for you, junior), headshots all five members of the opposing team, whose ill-fated noodles happened to be in alignment.\nCheck out the moment in the video below. As it's a multiplayer shooter, prepare for NSFW dialogue.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Z899M4v2NL8&ab_channel=sp1cay\nReferenced by Jake Lucky as a \"once in a lifetime\" shot, the wild one bullet Ace quickly spread throughout the CS:GO community, (naturally bringing folk out of the woodwork to claim that they \"do this at least once a day\".) Lucky notes that he plans to interview sp1cay about the cool clip at a later date, as the player went on vacation the next day — like your average hitman would after completing an assignment. Peyowww!\nIf you fancy checking out CS:GO for yourself, now is as good a time as any, as developer Valve has recently announced plans to launch a revamped Counter Strike 2 this coming summer. The new edition will carry over all of the community's statistics and purchases from the original game, but will sport an overhauled engine, updated visuals, dynamic new special effects, and tweaked maps and modes.

Its twisted tale is that of an expert games player who finds themselves delving deeper and deeper into the strange lore behind a mysterious and seemingly long-abandoned card game, the roots of which delve far deeper than one could ever imagine.\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1645468836605329433?s=20\nUpon release, Inscryption was highly praised for its creepy visual style, unnerving atmosphere, and smart blending of narrative, strategic gameplay, and metaphysical nature. Inscryption would go on to sell over a million copies and bag numerous awards, including the prestigious Game of the Year award from the Game Developers Conference. This new Xbox port will only serve to further invite more victims/players into its weird, soul-staining world, and is definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys deck-building titles with a strong slant on the mysterious and macabre.\nInscryption is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Creepy card-battler Inscryption now available on Xbox platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

The First Watch-developed multiplayer title will hit the lights on June 20, 2023. As of today, all in-game stores have been closed.\n\"After a lot of discussion, thought, and conversations across our team, we’ve made the difficult decision for Rogue Company to end support for our Nintendo Switch version, with our final date of support being June 20,\" wrote the developer in a statement. \"This choice wasn’t made easily or without concern for our community, however we realized that the performance of our Switch port was not up to our standards, and we were unable to provide the level of support our players deserved.\"\n\"We understand the impact this decision may have on our community and would like to assure you that we have worked diligently to find workarounds for various Switch-specific issues in the past. Unfortunately, significant technical and process challenges prevent us from continuing support for this platform, and we believe this is the best choice for Rogue Company.\"\nHi-Rez notes that it intends to fully focus its efforts on the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox versions of Rogue Company going forward. The studio suggests that Switch players utilize the Hi-Rez account linking/cross-progression service in order to continue playing on another platform with all of the content and statistics from their Switch edition.\nRogue Company launched in open beta in late 2020, before finally receiving an official release in May 2022.

But for those who haven't had the chance yet or don't have the means, there is also a mod that has now made Half-Life: Alyx playable from start to end, without VR.\nThe GB_2 Development Team has been steadily working on Half-Life: Alyx NoVR, a project with a simple goal: make Alyx playable without virtual reality. No need to install new drivers or anything like that; just drag, drop, and hit Play.\nIn an update published on April 9, the NoVR mod team confirms Half-Life: Alyx is now playable from start to finish, without a headset. Additionally, the Gravity Gloves and Combine fabricators are operational. The team also has an FAQ set up, with any additional info or details you could want.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTLotwKpLgk\nCurrently 33 of the 42 achievements on Steam are also earnable using NoVR. The other nine can't be earned at the moment due to workarounds and issues with triggers, though the crew is working to get these running in the future.\nMore updates are on the way, and other Half-Life: Alyx mods are even somewhat compatible with NoVR. It's pretty impressive.\nSeeing the world a different way\nYou might wonder why, with Half-Life: Alyx standing as one of the titans of virtual reality, you'd want to play it without the tech it's emphasizing. Well, as the GB_2 team points out, there's a multitude of reasons. Maybe you have health concerns, like easily getting motion sick. Or maybe it's an accessibiliy issue. Heck, maybe you just don't want to play it in VR, or want to experience it outside of VR after having done so in VR.\nIt's your choice, and though I think I'll want my own Alyx playthrough to be in VR when it comes up on the backlog docket, I appreciate how much work has been put into this alternative option. You can find the mod and keep up with its updates here.\nThe post Half-Life: Alyx mod makes it playable start to finish without VR appeared first on Destructoid.",

You’re in luck, because now you can play Dead Space reimagined as if it was running on the PS1 via a short Dead Space Demake demo developed by Fraser Brumley.\nThe tech demo is only 10-15 minutes long, and it seems unlikely it will ever get any more extensive than that. I gave it a try, and it… sure is Dead Space as depicted through chunky polygons and unfiltered textures.\n\"I've been working on this for a lot longer than I planned and the end product is probably shorter than you expect but I hope you have fun playing it,\" Brumley said on the demake's Itch page. \"This project was mostly a way for me to learn Unreal and the PS1 aesthetic so look forward to what I'll be putting together in the future.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_373107\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nIt’s kind of hard to say this is what the actual Dead Space would be like on the PlayStation 1. It still utilizes the over-the-shoulder camera angle that wasn’t really popular until 2005’s Resident Evil 4. It presents some dialogue through a heavily compressed cutscene, and I did find it amusing that Dead Space Demake keeps pestering you to “shoot off their limbs” multiple times, even after your first necromorph encounter.\nRather than an earnest attempt to fit a modern game on older hardware, Dead Space Demake feels more like a light-hearted homage. Sort of a fond love letter to both Dead Space and the PS1 hardware. In that sense, it succeeds. Just don't expect anything in the way of fun technical magic.\nYou can download the Dead Space Demake right now from itch.io.\nThe post You can play the PS1-style Dead Space demake now appeared first on Destructoid.",

The PC port launched just a fortnight ago on March 28, but immediately disappointed fans with its resource-hungry specifications, myriad visual glitches, and an array of technical and performance-related problems.

It sees Cal doing some great lightsaber swinging and Force slinging, but also the hero returning to Coruscant after all these years.\nCoruscant, once home to the Jedi temple, has since been converted into an Imperial stronghold. Cal's return to this place, where he saw the Jedi get wiped out first-hand, seems like it could be an emotional moment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmj3ty-Wt48\nWe don't just see it, either. It looks like we'll have some work to do on Coruscant, though it's not quite as open-ended as some have speculated. EA clarified over the weekend that Coruscant is not a \"freely explorable open world,\" only that it's one of the destinations in-game.\nWith that said, this new footage looks pretty rad. There's a moment in this trailer I love, where Cal is tussling with a Stormtrooper on hoverbikes. He shoves him off, and then Force-lifts him up into the air, right into an oncoming TIE Fighter's windshield. Fantastic. All of this, from the clever Force use to the tiny detail of Cal clicking off his lightsaber blade in the struggle, makes Star Wars Jedi: Survivor look pretty interesting to me.\nI'm a survivor\nIt feels like we haven't seen too much of Respawn's follow-up to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but that's also a pretty good thing. I'm curious to see how old friends work back into the story alongside these new faces, as well as Cal's new goals in finding a safe home for the Jedi. Also, considering how many Jedi are running around nowadays, you'd think he'd run into a few others on his travels.\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on April 28.\nThe post Final Star Wars Jedi: Survivor gameplay trailer teases a trip to Coruscant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Harada answers fan questions about new sequel\nKatsuhiro Harada, the long-time producer of Bandai Namco's Tekken, took to Twitter this weekend to answer fan questions regarding the attractive-looking sequel, Tekken 8 — As part of the impromptu back-and-forth, Harada essentially confirmed that the scrapper would feature both rollback netcode, as well as crossplay support, a first for the popular fight franchise.\nAccording to Harada, crossplay between platforms is something that the producer has already pushed for in the past, but various issues between platform publishers had kept this from becoming a reality. It seems, however, that Tekken 8 will indeed allow players on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X to battle it out against each other, which is always a huge boon for any fighting game community.\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1644917275621990401?s=20\nElsewhere in the online conversation, Harada said that Tekken 8 would feature rollback netcode, though it should be noted that current release Tekken 7 also features said technology, but struggles in an online capacity. One would hope that the sequel will see the online elements overhauled for stronger and smoother response. Harada also suggests that Tekken 8 might have a larger launch roster than \"Capcom-sama\", hinting that the new sequel will surpass Street Fighter 6's count of 18 World Warriors. When asked about a possible beta, the producer noted that the title was still in its alpha testing phase.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, and Leroy Smith.\nThe post Tekken 8 is expected to support crossplay for first time in series history appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie, which opened in American theaters on Wednesday, April 5, has seen sensational early success, with opening numbers surpassing those of the previous record holder, Walt Disney's 2019 sequel Frozen 2. The film, which sees Chris Pratt take up the role of the iconic Nintendo mascot, is being touted by analysts to become the highest-grossing movie of 2023, a feat that the animated movie looks set to achieve with ease, despite receiving mediocre reviews from many outlets.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNcTBXTk4I&ab_channel=Illumination\nWhile trailers have shown much promise in regards to the big-screen version of the Mushroom Kingdom and its denizens, some critics have lambasted the film for being all sizzle and no steak, complaining of wafer-thin storytelling, egregious use of cliched music, breathless pacing, and world-building that relies purely on reference recognition. Clearly, these comments have — and will — not divert the attention of the movie-going public, with the Mario Bros Movie set to dominate the spring box office and deliver further on the streaming and home release market for the remainder of the year.\nHope you like video game adaptations.

It feels like we just had the second round of Decidueye, but now Typhlosion is making an appearance starting on April 14. At this point, Game Freak is going to add a good portion of the returning DLC roster to the Scarlet and Violet through events. Let's dig into the nitty gritty of this particular event.\nWhen does the Typhlosion raid start?\nAccording to the official news post from The Pokemon Company, these are the times and dates for the Typhlosion raid:\nApril 14 at 9AM JST through April 17 at 8:59 JST\nApril 21 at 9AM JST through April 24 at 8:59 JST\nAs usual, you'll have two chances to catch it over two weekends, just in case you're on vacation and forgot your Switch or something.

However, you can square off against it an unlimited amount of times while it's up to farm 7-star raid goodies.

          "description": "Troublesome anti-tamper software leaves town\nCapcom has quietly removed the controversial Denuvo DRM software from the PC edition of its acclaimed release Resident Evil Village. A new update, initially spotted by DSOG, seemingly frees the survival horror sequel of the anti-tamper software that had reportedly been causing frustrating performance issues.\nWhen Resident Evil Village first launched for PC in May of 2021, players were disappointed to find the title laden with problems, from frame rate drops to stuttering audio and other random bugs. Players pointed to the resource-heavy DRM software which, it was claimed, was gobbling up vital resources needed to operate the visually splendid adventure. These accusations were offered validity after \"cracked\" editions of the sequel stripped the game of its DRM and were seen to run far smoother.\nCapcom has previously removed the Denuvo software from other games in its Steam catalog, including the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, as well as hack 'n' slasher Devil May Cry 5. So why has it taken almost two years for Village to follow suit? Cynically, one could suggest that Denuvo is only being added to scare off early pirates, with Capcom essentially pulling the tech once it believes that a title's \"honeymoon period\" is over. Regardless, if you have been holding off purchasing Village on PC because of the Denuvo factor, then it seems that the concern is no more. It will be interesting to see if everybody playing on that platform suddenly starts reporting a much-improved gameplay experience.\nResident Evil Village is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nCapcom has removed Denuvo from Resident Evil Village [DSOG]\nThe post Capcom removes Denuvo DRM from Resident Evil Village Steam edition appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The rabbit hole is no more\nIn glum news for Gothic gaming fans everywhere, producer and screenwriter American McGee has seemingly confirmed that EA has rejected his pitch for a third title in the cult platform adventure series American McGee's Alice. The second sequel, tentatively title Alice: Asylum, will no longer move forward as planned, with the series creator currently convinced that the series has come to an end.\nHaving built up a following via crowdfunding website Patreon, McGee took various materials to the publisher, including concept art, design documents, a narrative outline, and a development \"bible\", but it seems that EA simply didn't have the same interest or passion for the project as McGee and his backers. Speaking on Twitter, McGee suggests that this motion not only represents an \"endpoint\" for the Alice universe, but also for his own interest in the game development industry.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roV8oWmL9q4&ab_channel=AmericanMcGee\nThe original American McGee's Alice launched on PC in 2000 and told a particularly grim tell of Lewis Carrol's troubled young hero as she returns to a darkened take on Wonderland. This extremely cult release would be followed up in 2011 with action-heavy sequel Alice: Madness Returns. It should be noted that both titles are merely \"fine\" at best, but still garnered loyal, dedicated fanbases due to their curiously dark tastes, strange weapon designs, and intriguing takes on the Alice in Wonderland mythos.\nMcGee has attempted to get Alice: Asylum off of the drawing desk for many, many years, and it seems that this fight has taken its toll on the will and patience of the creator. McGee notes that he has no interest in developing further video games, and, should any company ever pick up the Alice license, then they will likely be making further titles without his input.\nWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\nIndeed.\nThe post American McGee’s Alice reaches ‘endpoint’ as EA rejects sequel pitch appeared first on Destructoid.",

As you battle your way through waves of enemy ships, ground walkers, and snaking, pattern-based baddies, your ship can be outfitted with a variety of cool new weapons and abilities, all of which will be more than necessary to redress the balance, as Rezon is nothing if not absolutely rock solid — borderline relentless.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Martinoz.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwXmOUfCpEQ&ab_channel=Martinoz\nBut let's address the elephant in the room: It's R-Type. It's shamelessly R-Type. Not in the sense that titles such as SNK's Last Resort are \"kinda R-Type\". Rezon is almost a direct clone, with carbon copy stage layouts, enemies, weapon designs, and general gameplay flow. Allumer's rip-off doesn't have the excellent bosses of Irem's 1987 hit, but it has practically everything else.\nUnsurprisingly, Rezon did not make its way to any home platform, perhaps more than aware of the questionable legal situation it might find itself in if too many eyes looked its way. Still, despite its xeroxed nature, it should be noted that Rezon provides a helluva challenge for hardened arcade fans, and is still worth a quick blast for the more dedicated of shmuppers.\nRezon is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Shameless R-Type knock-off Rezon jets into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, Maybe not the last one. We'll see. Whether the events of the movie will focus on classic SF adventures, encompass modern characters such as Luke and Juri, or be some wild amalgamation of the universe is, for now, all up for speculation.\nhttps://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1643660498150227977?s=20\nCapcom will no doubt be looking to at least match, (and hopefully surpass), the critical and financial bar raised by Warner Bros. 2021 release, Mortal Kombat. And given Hollywood's increasing lean towards \"somewhat good\" video game movies, SF fans will be hoping to see an authentic and exciting adventure that steps high above the poorly paced slog that is Street Fighter (1994) and the head-scratchingly off-brand Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009)\nIn the meantime, we can all concentrate on the upcoming launch of Street Fighter 6, a title that Capcom hopes will propel the legendary fighting franchise back to the forefront of the gaming scene.

          "description": "Seems EVERYBODY went Bingo\nCapcom has proudly announced that its recent release, Resident Evil 4, has already smashed past four million shipments and digital sales since its initial launch on March 24, less than a fortnight ago.\n\"The Resident Evil franchise features survival horror games in which players utilize a variety of weapons and other items to escape terrifying situations,\" wrote the publisher in a press statement. \"Cumulative shipments of the games in the series now exceed 135 million units since the first title debuted in 1996. Now, more than 27 years later, continuous support from the passionate fan base across the globe makes it Capcom’s flagship game series.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id2EaldBaWw&ab_channel=ResidentEvil\nThe meticulous, ground-up remake of the 2005 GameCube classic has already seen smash success, both critically and from a sales perspective with critics and fans, offering intense action, grisly visuals, and reimagined versions of classic boss battles and iconic setpieces, all powered by a WoK3 SouNdTraCk. Three million sales of Resident Evil 4 took place within the game's first two days of release, with a further million copies shifting in the following week.\nThis is, of course, not even the end of the road for Resident Evil 4, as fans can expect the monster-mashing mode The Mercenaries arrived as a free update for all players just yesterday. In addition, rumors persist that the enjoyable, Ada Wong-driven side-mode \"Separate Ways\" is also currently in the works, to be released as DLC for the remake at a later date. The incredible success of Resident Evil 4 sets publisher Capcom up for a stellar year, with titles such as Exoprimal, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy, and Street Fighter 6 still on deck for 2023.\nResident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 surpasses four million shipments and digital sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 4-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.\nSetting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.\nIssue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale.

But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths.

          "description": "For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: \nIt's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?\nSurprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. \nOver 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.\npic.twitter.com/Cy2cIo2AHl\nApril 5, 2023\nThis all just goes to show – the world wants Sonic dead.",

As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.\nNew Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.\nSeveral new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.\nNew Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.\nAmong several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.\nIt’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.\nGod of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\nYou can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.",

While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.\nWhat's your favorite minigame in Pokémon Stadium? Let us know in the comments!",

It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.\nThe same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…",

However, PGA Tour 2K23 defies expectations by announcing that 16-time World Champion and Hollywood star John Cena is joining the roster as a playable golfer.\nOn April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. \nPGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26.

As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game. \nHey people, we have some important news! pic.twitter.com/W2YKNk3xfU\nMarch 29, 2023\nDeck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen. \nFor more about Atlas Fallen, check out this trailer from last year. \nAre you excited for Atlas Fallen?

That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. \n\n\nFor those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:\nJack-8\nJin Kazama\nKazuya Mishima\nKing\nLars Alexandersson\nMarshall Law\nNina Williams\nPaul Phoenix\nTekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.\n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft skipping E3? Do you expect the event to still take place?

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.\nPlease note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.\nIf you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.\nThis fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.\n* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment.

While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
