          "description": "Taking the JRPG formula back to basics.\nThe Dragon Quest series is a staple in the JRPG community, continually churning out games of varying quality for more than 35 years. The latest entry in this seminal franchise is Dragon Quest Treasures, a spin-off from the mainline series, with many of the standard Dragon Quest tropes packaged into one of the most accessible JRPG experiences out there. While that translates into this game being a good starting point for fans new to the genre and the series, it won’t pose much of a challenge for seasoned treasure hunters.\nDragon Quest Treasures features a pair of familiar faces from the outset. Erik, who served as a party member in Dragon Quest XI, and his younger sister Mia toil away onboard a Viking ship searching for treasurers to plunder. Here is the first hint that this game is aimed at a younger audience, as the Vikings are presented as far more friendly and jolly than they were in Dragon Quest XI. Erik and Mia are aged down as well, with younger features and a more enthusiastic attitude befitting this cheerier adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This puts it just behind Splatoon 3's current total of 3,446,339, though it's probably safe to say that this has now been surpassed as of the time of writing.\nThere are only two new entries this week, including Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel: Dawn of the Battle Royale!! Let's Go! Go Rush!!, with the latter surely in the running for the most ridiculous game title of all time. Sparks of Hope saw decent sales to kickstart its tenure in Japan at 17,647.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Big Fish.\nDespite its title being ostensibly plucked from the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name, publisher Sammy’s The Rumble Fish series bears zero resemblance bar the odd bout of fisticuffs. Or, in this case, bout upon bout of fisticuffs, with a cast of colourful and interestingly designed characters.\nThe Rumble Fish series’ distinct hallmark is in its graphical style, once poised to catch the arcade goer’s eye and stir up interest in Sammy’s Atomiswave hardware. Rather than using standard hand-drawn sprites, it instead uses a routine where limbs are independently animated using sleek Flash-like animation. Although this gives the characters a certain marionette look, it’s a far cry from the likes of Earnest Evans, a Mega Drive and Mega-CD title that applied the same idea to unintended comical effect. Here, the Rumble Fish cast look great, blessed with a dreamy colour palette that really pops off the screen.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Alongside the new tracks and item customisation tool, there were a couple of big in-game changes that have been somewhat pushed to the side.\nOne such change is all to do with the game's infamous Lightning item and the effect (or lack thereof) that is has on your kart when gliding between platforms.

          "description": "This is more like it!\nNintendo is back with another wave of eight courses for the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, bringing us to the halfway point of its overall road map. Now we're up to a total of 24 new tracks over six unique cups, but so far, the output has been a bit mixed: we’ve had some bonafide classics like Coconut Mall and Mushroom Gorge, but also some absolute stinkers like New York Minute and Tokyo Blur. So how does the latest wave compare? Well thankfully, there’s a lot here to like and fewer bad eggs in the mix, making this comfortably the strongest batch of new courses yet.\nStarting off with Rock Cup, we’ve got London Loop, Boo Lake, Alpine Pass, and Maple Treeway. Things get off to a bit of a rough start, as London Loop is easily the weakest track of the whole bunch; this might come as little surprise given that it’s based on Mario Kart Tour and lacks the verticality and creativity seen in other games, but there’s no doubting that London Loop is an exceptionally dull start to Rock Cup. Conversely, the latter three courses are all remarkably fun in their own way, from Boo Lake’s deceptive simplicity to Maple Treeway’s meandering track and stomping Wigglers. It’s great fun and incredibly nostalgic if you’ve played the original games on which the tracks come from.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In case you've forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven't heard too much about the game.\r\n\n\r\nI got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game's blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. \nHowever, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new \"Stealth Strategy\" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.\nRead more",

          "description": "The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for \"Sweet Potato\" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. \nIn a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.\nRead more",

It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.\nAnyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I'm out of town right now, so I haven't been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know?

If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren't enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games' The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. \nIn some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be \"in constant fluctuation\" throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. \"It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat,\" says Becker. \"Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what 'victory' meant in the war - even with success, there is cost.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It's a vast undertaking, and there aren't any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12's website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. \r\n\nThe good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.\nRead more",

Bulwark Studios' star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic's RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.\nAlso like Homeworld, it's a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead's pride & joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.\nRead more",

          "description": "Season 2 of Overwatch 2 arrives tomorrow, and it's a bigger deal than it may sound. Overwatch 2 may have marked the beginning of a slightly jarring shift towards the free-to-play model for Blizzard's venerable hero shooter, but it's the release of Season 2 where players will get their first taste of the pace and quality at which future content will be released under the new regime.\nI got to spend a few days exploring the new changes that Overwatch 2's second season will bring around this time tomorrow, and I've come away feeling a little torn. On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable. On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don't seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.\n Read more",

The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. \nThere's a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan's authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it. \n\n \nRead more",

It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\nKynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.\nRead more",

I'm about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn't quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. \nImagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3's dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I've ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they'd earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it's been a while.\nRead more",

It's less common though, to fall afoul of whatever its opposite is. The uh, yellow-tinted glasses, maybe? My point is that I did you all a disservice when I described Emperor Of The Fading Suns as \"an intriguing, ambitious, crap mega 4X\" last year. It was a remarkable game, and more remarkably still, its developers Holistic Design Inc. recently updated it with a major patch, 25 years after its original release.\r\n\nIt's a lot better than I remember.

Některé balíčky dosaly CI (continuous integration), pro vydávání se přechází z Bzip2 na XZ tarbally, upraveny jsou varování kompilátoru, vylepšena kompatilibita s Clangem či novějšími verzemi Glibc.

Creative director Joe \"Mad\" Madureira, of Battle Chasers fame, is at the helm with Airship Syndicate. Digital Extremes, the company behind Warframe, is publishing.\nWayfinder is set in the world of Evenor, which is gradually being consumed by Gloom. Wayfinders (the players) take up the mantle and fight the Gloom, working to fight back against its spread together.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYFU7jrMAIM\nEach Wayfinder has their own unique story to explore and play style to utilize. You can collect and craft gear to improve your loadout, while also boosting up your character themselves. Runs can be customized with unique modifiers and challenges to offer special hunting and gathering chances.\n\nThe draw is multiplayer, and it looks like you can set out with a pretty decently sized party. Alongside fighting the Gloom, there's also an at-home customization element with the player's Apartment.\nFinding a way forward\nWhile Airship Syndicate and Digital Extremes are aiming for 2023 on PC and console, you'll potentially be able to play Wayfinder before the year's out. A closed playtest is being held for Wayfinder starting on Tuesday, December 13. If you want to try it out, you can head over to the Wayfinder PC playtest sign-ups here. Meanwhile, PlayStation playtests will be held in January.\nThen, in spring 2023, the duo of Airship and Extremes aims to launch Wayfinder into Early Access on PC and PlayStation. A free-to-play full launch is expected to follow in fall 2023, and embrace Digital Extremes' \"free-and-fair\" monetization policy, according to a press release.\nThe post Airship Syndicate and Digital Extremes team up for co-op action RPG Wayfinder appeared first on Destructoid.",

The next entry in the RPG series will arrive sometime in August 2023.\nRevealed at The Game Awards 2022, tonight's trailer showed off more of what's to come in the next Baldur's Gate. From old faces to new surprises, it seems like a lot.\nThroughout the trailer, we see looks at what's in store beyond the currently available Early Access version of Baldur's Gate 3. While an excursion to the actual location of Baldur's Gate is one thing, there are also some familiar faces in store too.\nBoth Jaheira and Minsc appear in the latest look at Baldur's Gate 3. These two were companion characters in Baldur's Gate II. Jaheira has aged thanks to the years since BG2, while Minsc has not, as he's spent quite a chunk of time petrified up until now. Larian even teased this development on social media leading up to The Game Awards. No sign of Boo yet, though.\n\nThe party sets out in 2023\nThe team at Larian Studios took the reins on Baldur's Gate years ago. Their successes with the Divinity series speak volumes, but in picking up where the BioWare of old left off with Baldur's Gate, the Larian team has been tackling a lot.\nSo far, in the Early Access versions that we've played over the years, it's felt like Baldur's Gate 3 is in a good place. That's just the starting point, though. We've only seen what chunks of the first Act hold for our party of tadpole-infested adventurers. There's still a lot of RPG to go.\nThankfully, Baldur's Gate 3 is aiming further into the year, past the spring rollout of new releases. Hopefully the August date holds true, and we'll see the entirety of what Larian has in store in the new year.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 sets a launch window for August 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kojima Productions officially unveiled Death Stranding 2 at The Game Awards 2022 tonight.\nStudio head Hideo Kojima took to the stage tonight to introduce the project, a sequel to 2019's Death Stranding. The trailer featured several familiar faces, including Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and Léa Seydoux as Fragile.\nAs for what's happening in the trailer? I couldn't tell you if I tried. But really, that's the appeal of Death Stranding to begin with, and Death Stranding 2 is carrying on the bizarre, vague trailer tradition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp6fSjMb0MQ\nNot many more details have been revealed just yet.

While Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was officially announced a few months ago, at The Game Awards we got our first look at how the game looks in action and I have to say it looks leaps and bounds better than its predecessor.\nOr maybe it doesn't. Fallen Order is still on my backlog. Anyway, Jedi: Survivor brings back Cal Kestis and is set five years after the events of Fallen Order. Hunted by the Empire, he'll have to do what it takes to survive, even if it means making some alliances.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRaobDJjiec&t=1s\nI've been more or less burned out on the whole Star Wars universe for a while now, but following the excellent Andor, I'm ready to get deeply back into a galaxy far, far away. And this looks fantastic and also like a lot of the 9.5/10 games that are building up in my backlog.

After all the kerfuffle over the game in the weeks prior to its release, I've been trying to find the time to play it and see just about the ending is pissing so many people off. Turns out, I'll need to play it asap because Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is coming pretty soon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5b3_gydc_0\nArguably the most surprising announcement of the first hour of The Game Awards (you know, aside from Al Pacino being there), Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will take the Umbra Witch back to the very beginning. Sporting a new art style and camera perspective, players will control Cereza and her first demon Cheshire as they fight faeries and solve puzzles while trying to find her mother.\nThis is not the direction I thought the character would go in next, but given what I'm looking at the in Bayonetta Origins trailer, it definitely seems like something that is right up my alley. Also, there isn't a Bayonetta game I haven't bought yet, so yeah, I'm gonna get it.

Their project had been kept under tight wraps with plenty of whispers but nothing concrete until tonight. One of the first trailers in The Game Awards this year was the Judas reveal trailer and, yeah, it looks a lot like a spiritual successor to classic first-person shooter series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoLJ4HgWqw4\nSadly, it's one of those trailers you have to watch on YouTube. Guess all the blood and guts makes it inappropriate for younger viewers.\nAnyway, there is a lot to take in with this trailer, and some of the imagery points to Levine once again diving into some controversial projects in the creation of this world. I'm definitely impressed by what's here so far and can't wait to see more in the weeks and months ahead. Hopefully, it's able to overcome Levine's storied perfectionism that often leads to tumultuous development cycles.\nJudas does not have a set release date, but when it does release, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and the Epic Game Store.\nThe post Judas is the next game from Ken Levine appeared first on Destructoid.",

For phone, there is an option to play with different orientations, vertical or landscape.\nInterestingly enough, one of the mechanics in this F2P version of Vampire Survivors is the option to view ads.

Truly nothing in the vampire afterlife is free, I guess.\nSurvive the night\nEver since Vampire Survivors dropped into Early Access last December, it's been a popular time-killer.

          "description": "All champions, all agents, and more\nRiot Games' library of competitive games is joining the ranks of Xbox Game Pass perks next week. League of Legends, Valorant, and more of Riot's catalog are getting Xbox Game Pass benefits starting on December 12.\nThe collaboration was announced earlier this year, during the Xbox Bethesda Showcase in June. Riot Games, the studio behind big competitive titles like League and Valorant, would offer some benefits for Xbox Game Pass owners, and they're pretty good ones too.\nFor League of Legends, a Game Pass subscription will net you all champions and access to new champions as they're released. Valorant is similar, with all agents unlocked for Pass users. Same goes for Wild Rift, the mobile League version, whose benefits will arrive in January.\nLegends of Runeterra will have all cards in the Foundations Set unlocked. And for Teamfight Tactics, there are some cosmetics. Additionally, everyone who links their accounts before January 1, 2023 will get some extra cosmetics.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRao6FARFRo\nLinking the Legends\nServices go live on December 12, next week. To link it up, you'll want to have the Xbox App installed and up-to-date on PC. There will be instructions to connect a Riot Account with an Xbox Game Pass account from there.\nWhile a library of games to download or stream is already a big boon, this Riot x Game Pass collaboration is pretty big. Having access to every playable character in League of Legends and Valorant means a fair bit of either time or money.\nWith this, players wouldn't need to worry about saving up currency or grinding for a new character to play. We'll see what kind of effect it has. But as someone who's played a fair bit of Riot's games, I'm still surprised this deal is even happening.\nThe post Riot’s Xbox Game Pass benefits for League, Valorant, and more kick off next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mail Time is one such game. From developer Kela Van Der Deijl and publisher Freedom Games, this adorable-looking platformer was previously announced for the Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac. Today, Freedom Games confirmed the game will also launch on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IydcIxSpoCA\nI'm not one for the wholesome game scene as it's burned me in the past and collect-a-thon platformers aren't exactly my cup of tea, but the art direction for Mail Time is doing a lot of heavy lifting in getting me interested. Taking place in the warm and inviting Grumblewood Grove, the game puts players in control of a Mail Scout as they explore eight different locations delivering mail, listening to stories, and collecting bottle caps. The developer is promising an inclusive experience with this one, letting players choose their Mail Scout's pronouns in addition to the standard character customization options.\nWith the 2023 release schedule up in the air right now–we'll see how that changes after tonight–Mail Time won't have much competition when it launches for Switch, PS4, PS5, PC, and Mac in April.\nThe post Cozy collect-a-thon Mail Time will deliver on PlayStation next April appeared first on Destructoid.",

With trusty bike and recording equipment in tow, the goal is to catalog and record the world as it is now, before it all goes away in a coming cataclysm.\nDifferent recording tools offer different ways to capture things. Whether it's a journal or a recording, or even just some memories, it's all a set of markers, remembering the world before it goes away.\nA game for every season\nThis new game from Scavengers, the team behind battle royale The Darwin Project, is certainly a bit different. It's a serene adventure about examining the world around you, rather than an explosive shooter. Its trailers so far have emphasized a beautiful, somber journey in store.\nScavengers was at the center of some allegations in early 2021, including accusations of high-level studio runners mistreating their employees. Following the report, Scavengers addressed the claims and made an update later on in the year, saying the team has worked to investigate and address the issues.\nWith a release right around the corner, I'm a bit keen to see what Scavengers has put together for Season. Tonight is The Game Awards 2022, a show sure to be full of blasts, explosions, and combat. So something a bit more meditative and mindful to balance all that out, right at the start of the new year?

          "description": "Grab your bucket and spade\nBandai Namco has announced that it has begun work on a new project based on Akira Toriyama's short-lived manga series, Sand Land. Very little was revealed about the project and its form, but the publisher offered a short teaser trailer and promised to reveal further details on December 17.\nFirst published in the summer of 2000, Sand Land was a short manga series written and illustrated by the Dragon Ball creator that appeared in the popular Japanese manga magazine Weekly Shonen Jump. Set in a dystopian world that has become almost entirely desert, with water in incredibly short supply. Our \"heroes\" are a small-town sheriff named Rao, and *checks notes* Beelzebub, prince of demons, who embark upon a quest to find the fabled Phantom Lake and return hydration to the planet. Also along for the ride is Beelzebub's mischievous friend, Thief.\nThis setup could form the basis for a fun RPG or action-adventure, and given the military coup themes and tank-based weaponry of the manga, there's much opportunity for antagonism, action, and adventure. Given Bandai Namco's excellent treatment of Toriyama's Dragon Ball franchise in recent years, we can assume that they have something authentic and faithful to the source material in the works.\nEither way, we'll find out more on Sand Land come December 17. Stay hydrated until then.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUMsxLXzmyo\nThe post Bandai Namco tease new project based on Toriyama’s Sand Land appeared first on Destructoid.",

Portraying a lost soul monikered \"The Unknown\", players guide our hero through the bowels of the underworld in an effort to regain her lost voice.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFAFzl_Tr7s\nMetal: Hellsinger's hook lies in its encouragement of the player to fight to the \"natural rhythm of the universe\" — shooting, dashing, melee attacking, and reloading to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Power-ups and bonus points are awarded for extended synchronization of soundtrack and action, with soundtrack vocals performed by such screechers as Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquility), Matt Heafy (Trivium), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), and Dennis Lyxzen (the Refused).\nLaunching on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, it was thought that the PS4 and Xbox One ports of Metal: Hellsinger had been canceled. But it would appear that The Outsiders has managed to complete its work on the last-gen editions, bringing the boom-boom to the wide audience that the game deserves. In addition, a new update has launched on all platforms, offering a new \"Archdevil\" difficulty setting and adding a new Elite Seraph demon to the armies of the damned.\nMetal: Hellsinger is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Metal: Hellsinger hits one million sales, launches on PS4 and Xbox One appeared first on Destructoid.",

The mysterious image follows on from the previous reveals of actors Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon, Maleficent) and Shiloli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). While the identity of the new face is yet to be confirmed, fans are strongly convinced that it is that of Lea Seydoux, (No Time to Die, The French Dispatch) who has previously portrayed \"Fragile\" in Kojima Productions' Death Stranding.\nhttps://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1600596136632279040?s=20&t=DRErVG6METsZbv8ZMDBkqw\nDoes this latest teaser confirm that the new Kojima title is a Death Stranding sequel? Ehh... Hardly. I know we live in an era where people seem to recognize Characters and not Actors, but it's just as likely that, if it is indeed Seydoux, Hideo Kojima simply wished to work alongside her again. Either way, it probably won't be too much longer before we hear a little more about the project, as Kojima himself has been seen in Los Angeles, all but confirming the scampster's appearance at The Game Awards.\nYou can watch along with us tonight right here on Destructoid.

The sudden removal of the tweet suggests that said video is cued to play during tonight's live TGA presentation. The deleted tweet also referenced an 11-minute Forspoken gameplay showcase, which will likely be hosted on the official PlayStation YouTube channel tomorrow, December 9, as part of Forspoken's continuing \"Deep Dive\" video series.\nhttps://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1600756189943410689?s=20&t=8d2Qc74adzfu6ObMzVeGKQ\nWhile Forspoken has had something of an inauspicious start, with online jokesters mocking its marketing strategy and critics raising an eyebrow at some admittedly foolish PR speak, I personally think that Forspoken is an attractive title with potential. A 2023 GOTY contender? maybe not, but it could certainly prove a fun way to kick off 2023's gaming year. No doubt Square Enix hopes that allowing players to get their hands on a playable build, giving them the opportunity to explore Athia and meet hero Frey Holland — will help turn around some of this early cynicism ahead of the title's impending release.\nForspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC.\nThe post Forspoken demo reportedly coming to PlayStation very soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

A release date is offered as \"06/02/2023\", with a USD amount suggesting that this is the U.S. depiction of the calendar.\nA Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate Edition of the fighter is listed as available to pre-order, with the Deluxe edition featuring a \"Y…",

We've had to watch idly by while the stores started peddling kitschy video game merch, all the while pulling back the focus on the games themselves. It's the circle of life — as technology changes, certain services or even entire industries will become obsolete while others spring up in their place. After another round of layoffs from the company hit the news, it feels like the retail institution could fold even as soon as the next few months. The meme stock saga kept it afloat for a while, but it doesn't look like that momentum has been able to translate to long term sustainability.\nFor Millennials and older Gen Z, going to GameStop for a hype-filled midnight release of your favorite game, or even a lazy afternoo…",

Handhelds were for smaller, less prestigious titles, while home consoles were for the big, knock-your-socks-off blockbusters. Enter Nintendo, with the friendly reminder that it didn't have to be that way. It's not that difficult to get a handheld to run a home console-quality game, and it's not that difficult to add an HDMI output to a handheld for those who still value the TV screen experience.\nNintendo was the first major company to properly execute on this idea (Sony's PlayStation TV doesn't count), and the Switch saw massive success as a result.

Even longtime fans of the franchise such as myself were shocked.\nMy Japanese is lousy, but I can read the language well enough to recognize the characters \"Ru-Ku\" in the image above. That translates to English as \"Luke\", which alone would have been enough to make Lucasfilm's lawyers foam at the mouth. Reading through the blurb is a little tougher for me, but per a confirmed A.I, translation from NMH super fan Travis Dies Every Day, the full text reads:\n\"Modern Jedi Master 'Luke'. Danshiya 'Luke'. His real name is Travis Touchdown. A geek and a thug of the hitman business, I will take on any boring killing. There is no creed at all. I go to the mall four times a week. In other words, if you don't have work, you don't have time, and you don't have friends.\"\n\"He runs danshi [boy?] with homemade sabers. All [of] his weapons, Naomi is making. He is currently ranked 11th in the UAA rankings. Fanatical fan of Japanese anime, especially the witch system is a favorite. Now I love it. I love T-shirts.\"\n\nAnyone who's played the series knows that this isn't too far from how the actual in-game dialogue might sound. Other than the gun in his left hand, and the overt announcement that Travis is, in-fact, a Jedi named after Luke Skywalker, all of this could, plausibly, have been official!\nAnd wait a minute, wasn't SUDA51's company rumored to be working on an Aliens game? That franchise is just one degree of legal separation from Star Wars! Maybe gun-toting Travis with this Skywalking nickname still has a chance of making it.\nThe post Travis Touchdown’s original nickname was, it seems, pure Star Wars appeared first on Destructoid.",

The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game's Collector's Edition.\nThe Collector's Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur's Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur's Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector's Edition certificate. The Collector's Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.\nOn top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira's return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur's Gate. You can see the trailer below.\n\n\nPrior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.\nBaldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved a \"very positive\" rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur's Gate 3 story.",

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.\n\n\nHere's what he said: \n\"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.\"\nIt's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.",

The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.\nBeyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.",

It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. \nTo say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:\n\"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?\"\n\n\nLevine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.\nJudas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.\nThe new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.\n\n\nAn earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6's Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.\nWe recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio's vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom's headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.",

It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. \nNarratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nBayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.",

The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. \n\n\n\"Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola,\" the game's Steam page reads. \"When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling.\" \nAs you can see in the trailer above, it's clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola's original Hellboy comics. It's easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.\n\nUnfortunately, we'll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist). \nAre you going to check out Hellboy Web of Wyrd?

The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. \nThe trailer didn't reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.\n\n\n Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three \"epic\" boss fights, and 20 outfits from \"Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.\"\nNo specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during \"Q1\" 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.\nAfter raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight.

          "description": "Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. \nIGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that \"This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.\" First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” \nGiven the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. \"I do think at some point we'll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.\" \nSony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.\nAs a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation. \n[Source: IGN]\nWhat do you think of Microsoft adopting the $70 price?

These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. \n\n\nPalworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you're catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we're still not entirely convinced it's a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. \nThankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we'll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.",

Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. \nLost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. \n\n\nDespite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. \nLost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

There's a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 \"A New Beginning\" trailer, which you can watch below: \n\n\nHere's another look at the Chapter 4 map: \nElsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. \nBefore all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 \"Fracture\" finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. \nPlayers were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. \n\nFortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed. \nDid you participate in the Chapter 3 finale? What did you think of it?

          "description": "We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!",
