And, given that Garchomp is laying down and seems to be having a nap, it looks like it's the perfect sleeping buddy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's crazy to think that prior to September 2021, we hadn't the foggiest idea when this game would show up, and now it's almost here.\nThe lucky ducks over at Game Informer have managed to get extensive hands-on time with Bayonetta 3 and are currently showcasing various aspects of the game on the outlet's YouTube channel. The first video is a relatively brief overview of everything new in the sequel, including the rather fancy 'Demon Masquerade' mechanic, environmental puzzles, side activities, and the introduction of 'Embryos' as the game's primary currency.

However, Black Mermaid's Moonscars has been turning heads since it was first announced due to its rather exquisitely detailed pixel art style. This is a deliciously dark 2D slasher with Metroidvania elements that reminds us a little of Motion Twin's dazzling Dead Cells, albeit with much starker environments housing its meticulously animated combat. But how does all of this lovely-looking murder actually play?\nWell, it's a bit of a banger all things told, an attractive marriage of excellent presentation and punchy combat. However, there are some pretty persistent frame rate issues present in this Switch port that have put the brakes on us scoring it exactly as we'd have liked to. Let's keep our collective fingers crossed that Black Mermaid can get this stuff patched up ASAP because, if these problems can be ironed out, you're looking at a super slick and stylish action game that looks fantastic and has some very clever gameplay wrinkles tucked up its blood-soaked sleeves.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Enemy noggins pop with a squelchy crack that tickles a very unnerving part of my brain, the resulting blood fountain spraying so high it causes the ceiling to drip with human juice long after your hopeless adversary has slumped to the floor. It’s gross. But. You know. It’s also kind of great.\n\n \nRead more",

So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)\nRomancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.\nThe demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)\n Read more",

The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).\nThat's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.\nRead more",

With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. \nThe best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers. \nRead more",

A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.\nRead more",

Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque's challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month's Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I'm sorry to say that's about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game. \nRead more",

          "description": "Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!\nSo what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.\r\n\nI have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals. \n Read more",

There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.\nWhether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond \"perfectly enjoyable\" into \"thrilling\", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.\nRead more",

          "description": "Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man's Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. \nUpcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again. \nRead more",

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant.

In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel?

Tvůrci zapracovali na systému widgetů, kdy mnohé dostaly různá visuální vylepšení (lze nově libovolně roztahovat či rotovat), podobné platí i pro TV režim Big Screen a různá rozšíření či plasmoidy. Více upravovat, například zvětšovat, lze i widgety v hlavním panelu (např. kalendář).",

Well, merchandiser iam8bit has the next best thing, opening pre-orders on a special Collector's Edition of Studio MDHR's excellent 2017 platformer.\nThe Cuphead Collector's Edition offers up a boxed physical copy of Cuphead — complete with its Delicious Last Course DLC — on PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch, alongside several suitably old-school goodies. These include a membership card for The Cuphead Club; six art cards or newspaper-style \"funnies\"; a sweet, hand-cranked music box; a map of the Inkwell Islands, and an exclusive outer sleeve for your game case, all of which are in keeping with Cuphead's classic cartoon style.\nThe centerpiece of the collector's edition, however, is an utterly delightful marionette of old crockery skull himself. Standing eight inches in height and sporting a weathered design, the super cute puppet will allow Cuphead fans to entertain/frighten their friends and family members with fun little performances... Or just hang him on the back of your bedroom door. Whatever works for you.\n\nAs a fun additional touch, the collector's edition box doubles as a stage, complete with an \"asbestos curtain\", so you have a charming little ramshackle display case for your new string-based pal. The marionette was designed by legendary Prague studio Rici Marionettes, with the team's loving attention to detail reflected in the model's authentic look and turn-of-the-century build.\nIt's good day for a great pre-order, and if you want in, then you can bag the Cuphead Collector's Edition over on the iam8bit website right now, priced at $199.99 USD. The box set is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2023. For those of you who are simply looking for the game itself, then standard boxed editions of Cuphead will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on December 6.\nThe post Cuphead Collector’s Edition includes this delightful marionette appeared first on Destructoid.",

Dismissed\nYet another live-service mobile title is being readied for the scrap heap — No big surprise, perhaps, but this particular example is branded with one of the most recognizable gaming IPs of all time. Square Enix has announced that Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, will be ending service in January 2023.\nOriginally launched November 2021, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier is a free-to-play title that tells of the formative years of the Shinra Corporation and its dedicated and ruthless merc army, SOLDIER. Following the typical battle royale format, The First Soldier tasked 75 custom characters with fighting it out in an ever-decreasing circle, procuring weapons and materia on-site in a bid to be the Last Soldier Standing.

But they also had a few other things on display, like this Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom statue.\nLink is donning his newer outfit, complete with a badass shonen cape, a bow, a sword, and a killer arm. The detail on the chain links of his armor and his gloves (and the belt!) are excellent: and the base he's on gives off the aura of \"dilapidated stone,\" which fits the dire/ruin theme of the game we've seen thus far.\nZelda: Tears of the Kingdom (which we know is pronounced like \"tears of joy\") is due out on May 12, 2023. It feels like it's been a long time coming, and it kind of will be! Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released in March of 2017, so by then, it'll be a whopping six years since it launched alongside of the Switch.\nI literally can't believe it! I've talked about this often, but Breath of the Wild is still deeply relevant, and I have to constantly double and triple check to make sure I didn't get the release date wrong.\nhttps://twitter.com/nintendoamerica/status/1579875692816216067\nThe post This official Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom statue looks fantastic appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious\nA virtual reality version of a very popular impostor game hits headsets soon. Among Us VR arrives on November 10 for Steam and Meta Quest.\nThis version of Among Us is a collaboration between Schell Games, Innersloth, and Robot Teddy. The new version will run for $9.99, and you can find it on the Steam store here or over at the Quest storefront.\nAs you can tell from the trailers we've seen thus far, this is essentially first-person VR Among Us. Players take on the role of different crewmates, all trying to complete their tasks on the ship. Meanwhile, one or some of them are impostors, and their goal is take out the crew while not getting caught.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y_QmaFkJ4g\nA brand-new perspective\nAmong Us VR will support four to ten players in a match. VR players can only play with other VR players, though. And it looks like the level included so far is called Skeld II, a 3D made-for-virtual-reality version of the Skeld from classic Among Us.\nThe old mini-games will return, as will some new ones just for VR. And of course, there's the difference in perspective. While 2D Among Us takes an overhead view, Among Us VR goes fully first-person. Seeing someone vent in VR will probably be terrifying.\n\nAlongside the news of Among Us VR's release date, today's Meta Connect showcase also held a few more big reveals. Meta has picked up several gaming studios, including Iron Man VR developer Camouflaj, Twisted Pixel, and Armature Studio, the team behind Resident Evil 4's Meta Quest adaptation.\nMeta also unveiled its new virtual reality headset, the Meta Quest Pro. It's a high-end piece of hardware that comes with a hefty price tag. Among Us VR, meanwhile, can run on the Meta Quest 2 or on other headsets via Steam.\nThe post Among Us VR is out in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

As the reboot passes a significant milestone, the developer is also talking about its plans for fine-tuning the game post-launch.\nIn a new blog, Volition and publisher Deep Silver confirm the 2022 Saints Row has seen 1 million players boot it up. That's a lot of players, but Saints Row has also been dealing with a number of bugs, too.\nThe studio says it is prioritizing delivering improvements over new features. Part of that is the major update planned for late November, the first one Saints Row is receiving since its launch in August.\nThe update will see 'over 200' bug fixes and stability upgrades. There will be a focus on challenges, overall stability.\n\"We’re especially aware of issues some players have been having with co-op and we’re sorry these fixes have taken longer than expected while we apply and test them thoroughly,\" said Volition in the update.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgjzDJA1o1E\nWhat's in store the reboot\nQuality-of-life improvements are also in store for the autumn update. A few specified changes include reducing repetition in some activities, improving management of vehicles, and making challenges more rewarding.\nThough newer content is \"less of a priority\" for the Saints Row team now, the crew is still planning for the future. Volition and Deep Silver say they plan to support Saints Row for the long-term.\nSaints Row is due to receive all-new story content in 2023, included in the Expansion Pass or purchasable as a separate piece. Free ne gameplay experiences and city areas are also in development. Cosmetic DLC is also expected to arrive this week for all Saints Row owners, with more on the way this year.

Designed by veteran designer Emerson Matsuuchi, the new game hopes to capture the surreal adventure and excitement of the 2019 smash hit.\nDetails are slim-to-none on the rules and setup of the Persona 5 Royal card game but, according to Matsuuchi, games will see players will team up as members of The Phantom Thieves before embarking upon quests to steal hearts, defeat demons, and redeem a rogues' gallery of bad dudes and dudettes. The world and characters of Persona 5 will all be putting in an appearance, from Joker, Lady Ann, and Morgana, to the Palaces, The Metaverse, and the luxurious but unnerving Velvet Room.\n\nThe Persona series has always been a fine fit for tabletop adaptation, what with its compendium of monsters and demons, multiple protagonists and antagonists, dungeon-crawling nature, and, of course, its sexy and immediately recognizable visual style. The franchise has seen a number of official and unofficial adaptations already, in the form of the Japanese card game Persona VS, and the very cool Unofficial Persona 5 Phan-Game.\nPersona 5 Royal will launch in the fall of 2023. In related news, Atlus announced this weekend that series classics Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will finally launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in January 2023.

The video will go live on the official Pokemon YouTube channel then.\nhttps://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1579819355851743233\nThere isn't any indication about how long this particular video will be, or what content it will cover.\nExploring Scarlet and Violet's new region\nWe've had a number of these info drops pop up over the last few weeks. On October 6, a new trailer dove into the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, showing some battle footage and the Terrastallize mechanic in practice.\nThe auto-battle function that's been teased was also shown off. This option lets Pokemon run off and fight their own battles, separate from the trainer. It can be used to pick up items too, and it seems like one of this generation's three main story pillars will involve storming a Team Star hideout alongside your Pokemon.\nA quiet surprise was the TM Machine, which will let players create TMs using items dropped by Pokemon. This could be a big one for endgame Pokemon raising and training, as well as helping players adapt to the gyms.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk3Fr9ysPYo\n \nAlongside news like that, we've also seen info about some of the new Pokemon and regional variants. New faces like Wigglett and Lechonk are already stealing hearts, or terrifying them in the former's case.\nAll this, alongside legendary mounts that can help you can get around Paldea, sure makes Pokemon Scarlet and Violet look like interesting entries in the mainline Pokemon series.

The original series was a trailblazer in the genre, and there's still a lot of goodwill left from modern adaptations like Fallout: New Vegas. To remind people of how important this series is, Bethesda is running a new Fallout retrospective series, which you can watch for free on YouTube.\nThe first clip, \"conceiving Fallout,\" has a few familiar faces, including folks from Black Isle Studios. Original producer Tim Cain, executive producer Brian Fargo, and original artist/designer Leonard Boyarsky are present for this first episode, in addition to Feargus Urquhart (division director at Black Isle).

Of course, the Mega Man 35th anniversary celebration is mostly centered around merch for now.\nAs reported by Rockman Corner, the \"first collaboration\" for the 35th anniversary of the Blue Bomber is...an expensive t-shirt line. In a partnership with Japanese company Avirex, Capcom is putting out Mega Man t-shirts, which will run you about 45 USD (as Rockman Corner points out, there's international shipping).\nThe main bit of news here (because there is always an endless supply of Mega Man merch) is the logo reveal, which came by way of the Avirex store. It's a stark contrast to the other logos (gathered by Rockman Corner), dating all the way back to the old school 10th anniversary. For four straight anniversaries (10th, 15th, 20th, 25th) we have a clear view of Mega Man's face (in various incarnations). Then for the 30th anniversary, Capcom opted for a cool minimalist design that lined up with the release of the Mega Man 30th Anniversary Bundle.\nBut the 35th logo is simply text, an off-putting giant \"35th\" numerical value, and a Capcom copyright. Mega Man fans know better than to expect anything from any given anniversary, but hopefully there's something in the cards for this milestone.\nThe post The Mega Man 35th anniversary logo looks blander than the rest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Valve, true to its word, was able to rapidly increase its output since spring of this year, and has seen to delivering upon all of the initial pre-orders. Manufacturing woes have continued to stifle hardware production for all major industries over the past three years.\nhttps://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1578474399204016129?s=20&t=fIvV6Tq70jy2OjXbysjNkg\nDespite the Steam Deck's relative availability, Valve has warned that production on the expensive piece of tech may slow once again should the company be inundated with orders. It seems that, for the most part, anybody who has been waiting on the opportunity to bag themselves a handheld PC can now do so over on the official website. In addition, the company is now taking pre-orders in Asian territories including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.\nIn other related news, a weekend hotfix saw the Steam Deck handle Capcom's Street Fighter 6 beta with what appears to be relative ease, Valve also took down several online videos over the weekend that showed the console running naughty emulators.

Several months later the team will move to London in October of that same year, followed by a concluding Fan Fest in \"early 2024\" in Japan.\nFor those of you who aren't aware of Fan Fest, it's a two-day celebration of Final Fantasy XIV, complete with merch to buy, hands-on events and challenges (some of which are unique to the convention), meet and greets, and even full-on concerts and performances. Typically, we also get content teases and reveals, including new jobs and features of upcoming updates and whatever future expansion is in store at the time.\nIf you're remotely a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I highly recommend attending. Given the cooperative nature of the game itself, and the positive reputation of the fanbase, it's a great way to meet people or just enjoy the game on your own.\nYou can find the full landing page for Fan Fest here.\nFinal Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023-2024 dates:\nLas Vegas, Nevada: July 28-29, 2023 (Las Vegas Convention Center)\nLondon, UK: October 21-22, 2023 (ExCeL London)\nJapan: Early 2024 (no venue selected yet)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plryox-p6SU\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festivals are back to in-person meetups as of 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

But in the remaining 20 seconds or so there's a release date announcement, plus a brief look at what costumes the upcoming amiibo will grant players. Reprints of several old Splatoon amiibo (including Pearl and Marina) are coming around the same time, so keep an eye out for those as well.\nKeep in mind that as of late, amiibo haven't been as super rare as they have been in the past. While old school amiibo hunters are always ready for an instant-sell-out situation, stock has generally been plentiful: so hopefully that will be the case for these figures too.\nOnce these three are released in November, we'll have the following announced amiibo remaining:\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):\nSephiroth\nPyra/Mythra\nKazuya\nSora (still needs full confirmation)\nAs always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.\nSplatoon 3 amiibo date announcement:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHyTzo3gAQ4\nA look at the Splatoon 3 amiibo costumes:\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" ids=\"347098,347099\"]\nThe post The Splatoon 3 amiibo trio are now dated for November appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, the tried-and-tested culture of barbecuing will also be coming to Sonic's world, in the form of a BBQ minigame and a roasted spit prop — Though I doubt very much that our boy will be doing much slaughtering in Sonic Frontiers.\nhttps://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1579624301820772352?s=20&t=mVEv77tdcl5CJx3a0M02Tg\nCrossovers are always cool and free DLC always welcome, but these titles sure make for strange bedfellows. Frankly, Sonic looks bizarre fully encased in Rathalos armor. But, as I noted at the top of the article, this strange partnership is perfectly befitting of a video game that itself is muddled in tone, being at once somber and ethereal while retaining the ring-grabbing, loop-de-loop action of the colorful and beloved 16-bit platforming series.\nI fully expect Sega to announce a Sonic Frontiers x Rainbow Six Siege crossover within the year.\nSonic Frontiers launches November 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers will receive free Monster Hunter-themed DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Big monsters, little console\nWith too many games announced years before they'll ever see the light of day on store shelves, I really get a kick out of those titles that go from reveal to release in just a couple of months. I don't like to wait for all that much, so it's great when there is a fast turnaround. Like with Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher for Nintendo Switch. Bandai Namco announced its localization just a few months ago. And yesterday, we learned the full release of the game is only days away.\nUltra Kaiju Monster Ranch for Switch will release on October 20. That is one day before my vacation to the Grand Canyon is set to begin, and I think this will be an excellent game to have along for the ride.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qGu1TEN4WA\nIf you've been missing out on what this game is, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher takes the classic Monster Rancher franchise and smashes it up with the Ultraman tokusatsu series. Players will raise kaiju, train them, feed them cookies, have them do battle, and fuse them to create more powerful monsters. It's all pretty ridiculous and I can't wait to see it for myself on October 20.\nAlso, I want to thank the members of our community who, in my last post about the game, gave me recommendations for Ultraman X shows to watch to ready myself for this release. It's been a lot of fun catching up with this franchise on my lunch breaks.\nThe post Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher hits Switch in less than two weeks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content remains. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. \nDo you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer?

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.",

Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. \nThe Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry.

You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nReleased in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn't happen.

Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action.

          "description": "Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. \nThe NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you're looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today's trailer is all about Mortal Kombat's 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. \nCheck out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the video above doesn't announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that's okay because it's still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. \nHere are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well: \n\nFor more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 11 review and then read about how NetherRealm is done making Mortal Kombat 11 content as it moves into development of its next game.

Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. \nFirst, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage.

One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.\nTequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. \n🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G\nOctober 4, 2022\nGylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.\nWill you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year?

          "description": "Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.\nPlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. \nCompleting campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. \nDigital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. \nIf you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). \nPlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.",

To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nKakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. \nThis new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. \nWhile waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling. \nAre you going to check out the new-gen version of Kakarot next year?

          "description": "Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. \nDon't get too excited just yet – this first look isn't a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. \nTune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).\nhttps://t.co/I868SmSpV2 pic.twitter.com/hqlO0SfLbe\nOctober 4, 2022\nHere's a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film's first poster:\nAs you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. \nThis image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. \nSuper Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.\nWhile waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is \"unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world\". After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won't have an Italian accent in the film. \nWhat do you think Chris Pratt's Mario will sound like?

          "description": "Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. \nThis news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation's investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, \"further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services\" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. \n\n\nHowever, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. \n\"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,\" he said. \nWhile Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. \nWhile waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that. \n[Source: Reuters]\nWhat is your dream From Software movie or TV series?

The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.\" \nAs noted in Babieno's writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony's God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of The Medium. \n[Source: Bloody Disgusting]\nAre you excited about a TV adaptation of The Medium?

Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.\nhttps://t.co/n9sLvsOLJS pic.twitter.com/b9GEoOZfEf\nOctober 3, 2022\nThis premiere is being dubbed as the \"first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. \nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. \nThose who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.\nYou can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.\n\nAccording to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.\n\"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,\" he said in a press release. \"I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it.\"\nThe collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.",
