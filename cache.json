Dropsy is the latest one, a point-and-click adventure coming hot on the tail of the most anticipated point-and-click adventure of the last decade or more, and from the same publisher, too (Devolver Digital).\nWe don't envy Dropsy following Return to Monkey Island so closely. There's another cool-looking point-and-clicker launching the very same day that we felt similarly bad for — one we're already working on a review for, in fact. Unfortunately, our resources aren't infinite, and with Dropsy being something of a known quantity (it launched on Steam in 2015), something's got to give.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride was the series' first game on the 16-bit console, and even today, Dragon Quest V is fondly remembered, despite the game not receiving an official Western release until its 2009 DS port.\nThe Super Famicom (or SNES) isn't a slouch when it comes to RPGs — with Final Fantasy IV, V, and VI, Secret of Mana, Terranigma, EarthBound, and the seminal Chrono Trigger being just a handful of names that Dragon Quest V has to compete with to be considered one of the system's best. Even so, it still manages to stand out on a star-studded console thanks to Akira Toriyama's distinctive art style, its cosy vibes, and grand, coming-of-age story.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Surprisingly, the fox isn’t saving a princess from a pig-man.\nThe opening moments of Tunic fooled us into thinking we were in for a derivative Zelda-like adventure. A diminutive fox-like character wearing a green tunic reminiscent of a certain hero wakes up on a beach. From an isometric camera angle, this fox (known as the Ruin Seeker) finds a sword and not long after a blue-and-red shield. Surely, it wouldn’t be long before we discovered boomerangs and bows to solve puzzles with – yet such item-based puzzles never came. Instead, Tunic cleaves its own identity with a handful of brilliantly unique mechanics and with combat pulled from that bottomless well of design that indie developers have yet to run dry: Dark Souls.\nYou’ve seen it before: a stamina bar dictates how much you, as the Ruin Seeker, can block or dodge attacks, and when you die – and you will die – an echo of your body can be recovered to regain the gold you lost upon death. Spending this gold with the proper upgrade item in hand, increases Attack, Health Points, Stamina, and so on. Your sword has a simple three-hit combo, but the complexity of combat against Slorms and Chompingnoms comes from recognising attack patterns, making use of invincibility frames in dodge rolls, and parrying if you’re brave. Throw in a handful of magic items, and the combat never grows stale in this 15-hour adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "“We’re going to make a fortune with this place”.\nThere has never been a better time to be a Pokémon Snap fan than during the Switch era. From the excellent New Pokémon Snap delivering a sequel over 20 years in the making to the long-awaited rerelease of the original Pokémon Snap on the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack, it seems like the spin-off series is finally getting the love it deserves. And yet, if all that Pokémon Snap love wasn’t enough, the team at Ghostbutter Games has released their own excellent spiritual successor in the form of Penko Park.\nWhat makes Penko Park immediately stand out is its visual style. In many ways, the game looks like Pokémon Snap meets the aftermath of Jurassic Park. The various creatures have overrun the once tourist-focused island, adding an element of uneasiness to the world. Some critters may look cute, but the vast majority have a creepy, Tim Burton-esque look to them. Combined with a whole group of creatures that can only be discovered by entering each stage’s spirit world, Penko Park undoubtedly has a sense of eeriness that gives the game its own identity.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This will also launch next month, on October 12th, and cost $329. Honestly, part of me was wondering if we’ll ever see the day, but yes: there really will be an Intel graphics card on the market.

          "description": "It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.\nThis looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.\nAs well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.\n Read more",

While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon. \nRead more",

Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.\r\n\n\r\nStill. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090.

With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.\nRead more",

          "description": "A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.\nI therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.\nRead more",

          "description": "The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.\nLeague Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.\nRead more",

It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.\nIt’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "Have you ever played a game and thought, \"Are we actually the bad guys here?\" Usually, the whole \"we're fighting on the wrong side of history\" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. \nAround 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, \"Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.\" It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck. \nRead more",

Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!\nWhen I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.\nRead more",

At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque!

These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects.

Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And it is that. But I wasn't expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.\nRead more",

She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling.

The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.\nGiven it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a \"GeForce Beyond\" show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.\nRead more",

          "description": "Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.\nIndeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time. \nRead more",

But rather going for a 512-bit FPU data path and the possibility of reduced clock frequencies and power/thermal concerns, they employed a 256-bit \"double pumping\" strategy. When getting the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in the lab, exploring the AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 performance was one of the areas I was most excited to evaluate. From the benchmarks about to be shown, AMD's initial AVX-512 implementation is promising and has me all the more excited for finding it on AMD EPYC \"Genoa\" processors.",

These secrets come in the form of a new \"Announcers Pack\", that contains narrator recorded by DC Comics' Clown Prince of Crime himself, Joker. This would, obviously, suggest that Gotham City's deadliest is getting set to join the MV roster somewhere down the line — This is an inevitability that will surely come as no surprise to anybody.\nYou can check out the unearthed dialogue in the tweet below, posted online by @LaisulMV.\nhttps://twitter.com/LaisulMV/status/1574811514489405440?s=20&t=ZGFG1IqOumrxd_N_YojfQA\nWhile this is unconfirmed at this time, the dialogue appears to have been recorded by Mark Hamill, who famously played Joker in the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, and is considered one of the very best portrayals of the psychopathic criminal in the canon. Splashing out on authentic voices and top-tier characters is partly responsible for MultiVersus success, giving the platform fighter a distinction above some of the other Smash Bros. clones on the market.\nPreviously, dataminers had uncovered voice lines for two more unannounced stars, The Wizard of OZ's Wicked Witch of the West, and The Ghost with The Most: Beetlejuice.

It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Today on Spot Dodge the crew discusses Nintendo’s downright unmatched game release cadence as a publisher.\nNintendo is one of the very few publishers that seem to work way ahead of schedule — the company has been known to “sit on” fully completed games until it can find an open slot to put them in its release schedule. Not only is that almost unheard of in today’s gaming economy, but most publishers are quick to release games before they’re done cooking.

          "description": "It was only a matter of time\nIn my opinion, Trombone Champ is one of the best things to happen to gaming all year. It's easy for anyone to pick up, it's well-designed, and it's laugh-out-loud goofy. I was skeptical when I heard someone say it's a Game of the Year contender, but it only took a few minutes into playing it to make me a believer. Now that the game's popularity has launched into the stratosphere, thanks to word of mouth on social media, we're starting to see the mods slowly roll in, which is exciting for someone who is very much a fan of mods.\nMods don't just include putting Trombone Champ in VR or adding custom song maps, however — it also means that players who modify their game to take custom controller inputs are back on the scene. In this case, it's my man Rudeism, a streamer known for his modified controller setups. At this point, I'm basically his full-fledged fan. This time, he hooked up a real trombone to play its virtual counterpart in the game.\nhttps://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1574760613683023879?s=20&t=rEXbyltnL1uM9nxDgm62pA\nAccording to his Twitter post, an \"ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting.\" I have no idea what any of that means, but he clearly got it working in Trombone Champ, so good on him. Rudeism also states in his post that he wishes he could play the trombone IRL, which has me wondering: did he full-on buy a trombone for this bit? Those things aren't exactly cheap, so that level of commitment is admirable, to say the least. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of an illustrious career for him as a concert trombonist.\nEither way, this real trombone Trombone Champ setup did exactly what it was supposed to — make me happy — and isn't that all we can ask for from our internet content these days? Now if anyone needs me, I'll be trying to top my high scores until someone mods K-pop songs into the game.\nThe post This guy played Trombone Champ with a trombone as a controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Drug arrest actor finally faces Judgment\nOnce Judgment hit the PC scene, it was inevitable that players would start to poke around with the title's source code, as the PC krew are wont to do — case in point, this new mod, which restores the voice and visual likeness of actor Pierre Taki, who was patched out of the RPG shortly after its initial release.\nThe controversy came about way back in the spring of 2019, when the (then) 51-year-old actor was arrested for cocaine use. While no illicit substances were found at Taki's home, the actor registered positive when tested for samples. Japan's drug laws are among some of the world's most stringent, and the event led Sega to immediately halt sales of Judgment in order to remove Taki from his role as the Tojo Clan's subsidiary captain, Kyohei Hamura. Judgment would eventually return to the market, with Hamura sporting a brand new face and a re-recorded voice.\nClearly, however, his likeness and vocal performance remained buried within the source code of the PlayStation edition, as modder Timo654 has successfully adapted a similar PlayStation mod to now work with the new PC/Steam launch. The Pierre Taki mod for Judgment can be accessed via the NexusMods website, and is compatible with the popular trainer Ryu Mod Manager, which is utilized for the modding of titles within the Ryu ga Gotoku series.\nAs for Taki himself, the Tokyo District Court handed down a sentence of 18 months in jail for cocaine use. The sentence has a three-year suspension period. The actor has continued to work in film and television since the arrest.\nJudgment PC mod restores ‘disgraced’ original Hamura actor [PCGamesN]\nThe post Judgment PC mod restores previously removed actor Pierre Taki appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new port of the smash-selling PlayStation title will come wall-crawling onto Steam and Epic Games Store platforms sometime this fall.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3wEP8kJ6Vo\nReleased in November 2020 as a PS5 launch title, The Marvel's Spider-Man pseudo-sequel follows the adventures of young Miles Morales, who is forced to step up his game as Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man when his home district of Harlem is severely threatened by the collateral damage of a war between greedy capitalists and a violent criminal element, led by the malevolent Tinkerer. Having only just discovered his calling as Spider-Man, Morales is pushed to hit the ground running in order to save his community from annihilation.\nMuch like its beloved predecessor Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales was celebrated by both video game and comic-book fans for its authentic replication of the Spiderverse and its popular cast of characters. Critics praised the follow-up's slick and engaging gameplay, fluid combat, and improved range of side-missions and activities. This new port will represent the latest in an increasing catalog of PlayStation titles that are making the leap to the PC platform — a library that also includes games from popular Sony franchises including Uncharted, God of War, and Horizon Zero Dawn.\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales will launch on PC this fall.

          "description": "\"So that everyone has the same experience\"\nAccording to the game's producer, the approach to difficulty in Wo Long: Fallen Kingdom will be similar to how From Software (and Team Ninja itself) has handled many of their games in the past: there's one non-negotiable setting.\nSpeaking to MP1st, here's what producer Masaaki Yamagiwa had to say on the matter: \"We’re thinking it’s good to have one set difficulty so that everyone has the same experience of overcoming a really intense obstacle and they all have that feeling of achievement, like 'I did it.' But the caveat there is giving players all different ways that they can do that.\" They go on to comment that you could \"talk to your friends\" about beating a boss, and share that experience.\nThey also clarify that Wo Long is \"not an easy game,\" but they want to give players \"as much freedom and agency to play it as they want.\" Part of that freedom and agency is the morale system, which Yamagiwa explains: \"One thing that comes to mind is the morale system. You have a morale rank and as you keep increasing it you get stronger and you can use that to choose which enemies to fight, or raise it up so you can take on a harder enemy and maybe they’ll be a little bit easier now that you’re stronger.\" That system was actually present in the demo, and while it's confusing at first, it's another tool in the tool kit in terms of squaring up opponents. Think of it like a micro-leveling system, where you (or your enemies) can raise your power level.\nIn any case, the \"single difficulty setting\" conversation is bound to have a lot of different takes, but at least we know where Wo Long stands either way. Given Team Ninja's recent takes on action adventure romps, this isn't a surprise.\nThe post Wo Long will have one difficulty setting, says producer appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the title does feature world traversal, puzzle-solving, and combat elements, it must be noted that the adventure is more a trek to be enjoyed than a challenge to overcome. In any regard, Kena is a very attractive and charismatic venture, and deserving of the plaudits directed toward its visuals, audio, and satisfying mechanics.\nIn addition to the Steam launch, a new \"Anniversary Update\" is available to download for free on all platforms. The package adds a New Game+ feature, Spirit Guide trials, new Charmstones, and various accessories and outfits for our lovely protagonist. Deluxe Edition owners will get an exclusive bonus outfit.

          "description": "New IP rights retained by studio\nDeveloper People Can Fly (Outriders, Bulletstorm) announced that it has had its cooperation agreement terminated by publisher Take-Two Interactive. This motion severely affects the current development plans for People Can Fly's \"Project Dagger\", a title that has been in production at the developer's New York studio for the past two years.\nThe news was revealed in People Can Fly's latest financial update, where it is stated that Take-Two, the publisher behind such behemoths as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, had essentially pulled out of the project entirely, leaving Project Dagger with a developer, but no publisher to handle its eventual marketing and release. Take-Two seemingly chose not to purchase the rights to the project, which will be retained by the studio.\nAddressing the turbulent situation, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski says that he \"assumes\" the two companies will part on good terms, and expresses the studio's desire to continue development on the title, with an eye to finding a new publisher, or perhaps even self-publishing. Project Dagger, which remains under wraps, had been described previously as a \"groundbreaking adventure game\", and is currently in the process of transitioning from Unreal 4 to the dazzling new tech of Unreal 5.\n\"We strongly believe in the Project Dagger's potential and are now committed to continue its development within our self-publishing pipeline,\" confirms Wojciechowski. \"The game is still in pre-production – our team is now focusing on closing combat and game loops and migrate from UE4 to UE5. I'm conscious that this decision will add investments on us, but self-publishing is part of our strategy.\"\n\"Of course, we are not ruling out working with a new publisher if this creates a compelling business opportunity.\"\nThe post Take-Two ends co-operation with People Can Fly two years into Project Dagger development appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio was purchased by Netflix roughly a year ago today.

Spare a thought for all of those Jam and Elphelt players, for example, still sitting patiently as they await their respective mains to make the leap to the GG Strive roster.\nIt's definitely neat to see the developer retrofitting its older releases with newer tech — helps keep those titles alive for the devoted players who are either playing multiple GG games competitively or are not quite feeling the latter-day release.

          "description": "Get a look at all the sights, sounds, and faces of HBO's adaptation\nHBO has published a new trailer for its adaptation of The Last of Us today. It spotlights a whole bunch of familiar faces, and gives us a good idea of where the production is headed with Naughty Dog's story.\nThe center of the trailer is obviously Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. The duo are the core of The Last of Us, and we see a lot of familiar moments with them. Joel looking gruff and getting violent, and Ellie learning to thrive and survive in the harsh world around them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBRRDpQ0yc0\nWe also see the broader cast of the series. Merle Dandridge as Marlene, Nick Offerman as Bill, Nico Parker as Joel's daughter Sarah, and Storm Reid as Riley all make an appearance. The latter does suggest that we'll be seeing the DLC content Left Behind somehow folded into The Last of Us, which is great. That particular slice of the story adds a ton to Ellie's character and would be missed if it got left out.\nSave who you can save\nThis is the longest look yet at the series, and it's interesting that the trailer doesn't explicitly set up the story of Joel and Ellie's cross-country road trip.\nIt's an adaptation of Naughty Dog's well-known and recently remade survival action game, so fans already know what's coming. And for an unaware outside observer, I imagine the action, emotions, and ominous western music over footage of zombies gets the appeal across. Either way, it's a solid trailer, and one that's got me keen on seeing the premiere.\nNo date's been set yet for HBO's The Last of Us, outside of a 2023 window. Naughty Dog has been celebrating today, the unofficial-official Last of Us Day, with a bunch of new GIFs and other fun tidbits for TLOU fans.\nThe post HBO’s The Last of Us gets a new teaser trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

As Mike puts it, they've been \"working toward this moment since 2015,\" aiming to \"create a classic Mario game that plays as if Nintendo created it themselves.\" To that end, it'll feature eight worlds, with 40 full courses (24 from the Super Mario World archetype, 14 from Mario 3, and two courses from Super Mario Bros.). The idea was to give the entire project a \"classic\" feel.\nGoing even further with that philosophy, Metroid Mike's aim isn't to \"troll or purposely try and kill you,\" but rather to ease you into level designs that feel like they're organically present in a prior classic Mario game. While there's plenty of room for \"instant/death can you even beat this\" Mario Maker designs, I appreciate the core focus here; as it'll make it even easier to pick up and play from a general audience standpoint. Going a step further than that, Metroid Mike added in world maps with \"branching paths,\" as well as some light puzzles.\nThis is an extremely \"weekend plans set\" situation. Want in?

          "description": "The big show's back in town\nE3 is set to return as an in-person event in 2023, and today the event locked in some dates and details. E3 2023 will be a four-day expo, running June 13 through 16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.\nPreceding the show will be partnered digital events and showcases. Those will start on June 11.\nE3 itself will have set days for business and consumer attendance. The E3 Business Days take place June 13 through 15, set aside for registered industry people. June 15 and 16, meanwhile, will be E3 Gamer Days.\nAlongside the split in days, E3 2023 will also have separate areas set up. The industry side will have dedicated halls for networking and meetings, as well as hands-on for media with developers and publishers.\nThe consumer-focused area will be in a different hall. This will have hands-on for attendees, as well as ways to connect with developers, content creators, and personalities. There will also be a dedicated theater for content, offering deep dives on upcoming games.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73kSvsQ_kkA\nIt's showtime\nThe ESA is partnering with ReedPop, the organizer of events like PAX, EGX, and New York Comic-Con. (Disclosure: I was once employed by ReedPop in my previous role at USgamer.)\nIn a blog over at GamesIndustry.biz, the business site goes over some extra details on what ReedPop and E3 are planning for the show. The show plans to support companies and games who aren't joining officially to still participate. For example, if a company is showcasing at Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest, E3 will still be open to it.\nThis is E3's first return to in-person, after canceling its 2020 and 2022 plans and hosting an online-only event in 2021. It has been three years since the last big E3, and the show looks to bounce back in 2023.\nWhether this will hold up depends, as the industry has now adapted to three years of online showcases and scattered, smaller in-person events.\nThe post E3 locks in 2023 dates, with both industry and consumer days appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"When it's ready\"\nThis past weekend, Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone took to Twitter to give us an update on Stardew Valley 1.6, as well as the 1.5 mobile situation.\nFunnily enough, roughly a year ago Barone wasn't quite ready to confirm update 1.6, but it's still on the way nonetheless. We didn't get a release window, but rather, a re-confirmation that it's still being worked on: \"no target release date... just when it's ready.\"\nThere's another part of this story too. Several months ago, Barone had mentioned that update 1.5 could hit mobile platforms \"by the end of the year.\" While they didn't have any specific date in mind with this newest tweet, they did explain that it is still coming, and \"will be out before 1.6.\" For those of you lapsed players, update 1.5 is quite significant, as our own Jordan Devore explains: \"Update 1.5 includes Ginger Island, a new getaway to explore and expand, as well as numerous improvements to the core game. You can have a fish tank, watch ducks swim, move your bed, sit on chairs, raise ostriches, and try a beach farm layout...the list goes on.\"\nOf course, all of this is happening while Barone is working on Haunted Chocolatier, as a small indie outfit. \"When it's ready\" indeed! As far as I'm concerned, this game has already been worth its weight in gold, even if update 1.6 never comes out.\nThe post Stardew Valley 1.6 is still coming, 1.5 mobile will be out before it appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lush anime fighter getting re-evaluated\nNexon and Arc System Works have announced several new updates currently in the works for DNF Duel. The totally wild anime fighter will receive a fresh run of bug stomps and balance tweaks before the year is out, although no mention was made of any additional DLC characters.\nAnnounced during the weekend's CEOtaku tournament, the first update will fix several technical issues that have troubled DNF Duel since launch, including screen freezing during online battles and input issues that are exclusive to the PC/Steam platform. These and other problems will be addressed in a new patch, which is scheduled to drop on all platforms at \"the end of September\"... which is now, to be honest.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o02qkoTwnvg\nThen, in December, a new balance update will be applied to DNF Duel, taking a look at some of its stronger and weaker characters. While chaotic and powerful combos are part of the fighter's make-up, there are still a few characters who could stand to be a little less dominant, (looking at you, Swift Master), and so the December update will attempt to bring the entire roster a little more in-line — hopefully without putting the brakes too hard on DNF's unique, aggressive, and devastating style. It is believed that the patch will focus far more on buffing lesser characters than nerfing the upper tiers.\nProduction Director Kodani also noted that the team was working on \"something else,\" but did not offer any further information, other than that it was \"exciting\" and that the DNF community should look forward to it. This seems to suggest some form of additional content, perhaps characters, modes, or some technical upgrade. For now, we will simply have to wait and see.\nDNF Duel is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. It's a rad fighter, well worth checking out.\nThe post New bug ‘n’ balance updates headed to DNF Duel this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's look at the timeline of how everything Detective Pikachu-related has gone down.\nThe full timeline of the Detective Pikachu series\nFebruary 2016: A three-chapter smaller version of the game is released in Japan titled \"Birth of a New Duo,\" which is the first major appearance of the Detective Pikachu character.\nMarch 2018: The full version of Detective Pikachu is released worldwide on 3DS, with a nine-chapter storyline (and a giant accompanying amiibo).\nMay 2019: The Detective Pikachu film debuts, and smashes video game box office records (a sequel game is subsequently announced for Switch).\nSo this new late-2022 update actually all boils down to a LinkedIn profile from Jonathan Murphy, who worked on the game at Creatures Inc (the studio that developed the first entry). As spotted by Famiboards user MetalLord, Murphy used the phrase \"worked on one unannounced project and one nearing release, Detective Pikachu 2.\" Murphy has since changed their LinkedIn profile to note that the game is \"in development,\" removing a mention of \"nearing release.\"\nHonestly, this is pretty explosive info if it's actually correct, especially if Nintendo is aiming for a mid-2023 release to spice up the Nintendo Switch lineup. While the jury is out on how accurate this LinkedIn statement is, at the very least, Detective Pikachu 2 is still in development. Some of us want to know how the game ends (assuming it's not the same as the film)!\nThe post The elusive Detective Pikachu 2 Switch game shows signs of life appeared first on Destructoid.",

As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: \n\n\nI'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. \nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. \nIs Wiglett going to be in your party?

Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. \nThe ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. \nJune 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   \nAs previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a \"world class event to serve the global gaming industry.\" The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice?

          "description": "The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.",

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…",

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that's faster and stronger. And sure enough, that's exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers' marketing thus far.

          "description": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8.

However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.\nWave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. \nMario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.",
