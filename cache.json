The developer was behind several of the stellar titles found on the system, many of which were some of the most original games in history. One of the most unique titles released by the UK-based developer was the 3D action-shooter Jet Force Gemini, which launched in 1999. While Rare had much success in the first-person shooter genre with titles such as GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, it decided to take a different approach for this title and set about making it a third-person experience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But as I've mentioned previously, with Tears of the Kingdom, we were seeking to build on top of the world we created with Breath of the Wild and really exhaust the possibilities of what we could put into that world. I think it is – to use a bit of a term – an apotheosis, or the final form of that version of The Legend of Zelda.

The Game Awards is not only an awards ceremony - it's a lavish smorgasbord of video game announcements, trailers, and news stretching into the early hours of the morning. At least for us Brits.\nIn case you don't have the time to sit through the entire multi-hour livestream, we've done the hard work and put together a list of every noteworthy trailer and announcement that was shown at this year's The Game Awards. You can get started reading; I'm just gonna... shut my eyes for a bit.\n Read more",

This mic originally retailed for $100 and attracted strong reviews at that price point - but at $17, it's cheap enough to recommend to literally anyone that uses a computer. \nRead more",

          "description": "“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. \nRPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. \nMimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio.

Back when it was first revealed in May at Sony's pre-notE3 PlayStation Showcase, its colourful, fever dream visuals from Hotline Miami artist El Huervo instantly made it stand out among all the drab multiplayer shooters jostling for attention. Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time. This is surely going to be one to watch for Metroidvania likers when it comes out on February 13th next year, because cor, this is looking really quite good, folks.\nRead more",

          "description": "Prophecy's Tribes 3: Rivals broke cover earlier this month - or more accurately, came skiing out of cover with a flag in one fist and an electric crossbow in the other. The developers have now shared a bit about how it differs from Hi-Rez's Tribes Ascend, released way back in 2012, which we adored.\nCreated by a former Hi-Rez subsidiary that includes several of the original Ascend leads, the new shooter retains its celebrated predecessor's emphasis on agility and momentum, but will be a premium game sold for $20 with separately sold cosmetics, rather than a free-to-play affair. It also won't have a singleplayer campaign, much to the probable consternation of Tribes: Vengeance fans, and the indifference of everybody else.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the grim darkness of the far future… I will finish my review of Owlcat’s Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader. It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.\r\n \nRead more",

Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, \"the humans are bad\", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.\nRead more",

We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.\nNine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.\nRead more",

At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.\nAlso, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.\nRead more",

There are a few reveals in the offing. Some, we already know about, and may even have written up in advance; others, we'll learn about together with your good selves when the livestream begins at 4.30pm Los Angeles time on 7th December, which equates to 12.30am on 8th December (ouch) in the UK. There's the trifling matter of the first GTA 6 trailer on 5th December, too.\r\n\n\r\nSome games out this week that we're keeping in the corner of our eye, in case they turn on us: A Highland Song (5th Dec), Blood West (5th Dec), Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader (7th Dec), Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (7th Dec).\r\n \nRead more",

Každý deň od 1. do 24. decembra sa zverejní nová séria úloh z vybranej oblasti počítačovej bezpečnosti. Úlohy sú relatívne jednoduché a účastníci nájdu riešenia priamo v zadaniach. Neskôr sa riešenia preberú v podrobných video tutoriáloch. Advent of Cyber je určený pre všetkých začiatočníkov, ktorý sa zaujímajú o kybernetickú bezpečnosť.",

          "description": "After winning big last night at The Game Awards and bagging trophies in three major categories, Remedy Entertainment has just announced \"The Final Draft\" for Alan Wake 2; a major update that not only introduces the New Game Plus mode we've been waiting on, but also unlocks an additional ending to the main story.\n\n\nWith all the intricate plot threads and surrealist narrative developments in Alan Wake 2, a few more playthroughs are definitely in order to wrap your head around Sam Lake's acclaimed sequel. And why start from scratch when you can retain all your equipment and instead contend with more challenging mobs?\n\n\nThe studio is teasing numerous \"subtle additions\" in the New Game Plus experience, including a Nightmare Difficulty setting and even new manuscript pages and videos. There are also bug fixes and performance optimizations, which might help the demanding game run more smoothly on older PC hardware.  The Final Draft is scheduled to go live on December 11.\n\n\nvia Remedy Entertainment\n\n\nHow to unlock the New Game Plus mode in Alan Wake 2\n\n\nIt goes without saying that a completed playthrough of the game is required to unlock the New Game Plus, but it looks like the new additions in The Final Draft will also require you to finish the game at least once.\n\n\nYou retain all your Charms and character upgrades, but the weapons will be found in the character's first available shoebox, as opposed to their inventory.\n\n\nIt's unclear if the new ending can be unlocked during your first playthrough, though with two more expansion packs (Night Springs and The Lake House) coming our way in 2024 and beyond, this probably won't serve as the definitive conclusion to the stories of our main protagonists.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 is getting a “New Game Plus experience” next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a long night of The Game Awards. Many trailers have been shown for upcoming games, but only one can be the final trailer. Capcom has taken that honor this year by revealing the newest installment in the Monster Hunter series, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\n\nAs has been a recurring theme during this event, we didn't exactly see a ton of raw gameplay in this trailer. We do, however, see a lot of monsters. Also, some sick mount acrobatics are shown off. And before we know it, a title card is thrown on screen. Clearly this is a teaser just to let us all know this game exists, since that projected date of 2025 is still a ways off from now. Feel free to speculate based on the footage we were shown.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the trailer, Geoff Keighley brought Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto to the stage. Despite acknowledging that the game is dated for 2025, Keighley asked Tsujimoto when we might expect to play Monster Hunter Wilds. As one might expect, the answer for when we'll play this video game coming out in 2025 is \"2025.\" However, Tsujimoto clarified that we should expect to learn more about the title during the Summer of 2024.\n\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. This is notable, as the game's predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, was originally a Nintendo Switch title. The platforms shown indicate that Wilds will be closer in spirit to Monster Hunter World, which will be roughly seven years old by the time Wilds comes out. \n\n\nI'm interested to see if games like Monster Hunter Rise on the Switch and Monster Hunter Now on mobile devices drives winds up attracting new audiences to Monster Hunter Wilds once it releases. It's certainly made me pay more attention to the series, so we'll have to see if this strategy pays off when Monster Hunter Wilds debuts two years from now.\n\nThe post Capcom announces Monster Hunter Wilds, coming 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even though we knew the Xbox version was on the way, it will surely come as a nice surprise for Xbox gamers to finally get the opportunity to jump into this epic game.\n\n\n\n\nWith the release, Baldur's Gate 3 is now officially available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 stealthily releases on Xbox Series X|S after TGA appeared first on Destructoid.",

The trailers reveal that we'll be getting more of the explosive combat that made the base game so exhilarating to play, though there'll be new enemies to contend with. \n\n\nAs a PlayStation blog post explains, in addition to new chapters, the DLC brings with it a new level cap, weapons, battles, and accessories. One of the weapons included is the iconic Buster Sword. There's also a musical treat in the form of \"the 'Away (1987)' Orchestrion Roll which allows a chip-tune version of the song 'Away' to be played as background music in the hideaway.\" \n\n\nThis isn't all that fans are getting, as The Rising Tide is another DLC that will be coming in Spring 2024. Not much has been revealed about it except that it \"will bring new challenges and more, including the confrontation between Clive and the legendary Eikon, Leviathan.\" \n\n\nBoth DLCs are paid but with all the next content I am tempted to crack open my wallet and return to the game.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy 16: Echoes of the Fallen DLC receives shadow drop appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Open Betas of The Finals has been enough to turn this FPS into a very anticipated multiplayer game. As one of the biggest surprises of The Game Awards, Embark surprise launched the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. \n\n\nThough we've gotten a sample of it prior, we'll finally be able to see everything the adrenaline-filled shooter has to offer. With the launch of Season 1, you'll get to play in the Las Vegas virtual arena that'll leave you dazzled with its lights and even some unexpected features such as UFOs. \n\n\nAs Embark has explained, at its core, The Finals is a game show featuring arenas inspired by real-world locations. You're given the freedom to create your own hero and vie for victory. It doesn't hold back when it comes to mayhem-filled fun, and you can show off your skills in environments reactive enough for furniture to be destroyed and buildings to collapse. \n\n\nImage via Embark. \n\n\nThe hype behind The Finals\n\n\nThe game's unique premise and gorgeous visuals attracted over 7.5 million players during its Open Beta. Though it was praised by critics and players alike, some technical issues slightly dampened the experience. Embark has acknowledged these hiccups and has paid attention to community requests when tweaking the final release. \n\n\n\n\nIf you're new to The Finals, be prepared for something quite novel. As creative director Gustav Tilleby explains, \"The Finals isn’t another battle royale, military sim, or tactical FPS – there are plenty of those out there. It’s an entirely new take on shooters.\" It's hard to argue against this, as while we've had FPS games with destructible environments before (looking at you BattleBit Remastered), the studio's doing it on a scale that few others would attempt. \n\n\nEmbark is a relatively young studio, having been founded in 2019. If pulled off correctly, The Finals could be the title that puts the Swedish team on the map. \n\nThe post The Finals receives a surprise launch at The Game Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s the planet we live on!\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer shows off multiplayer, construction, and all kinds of traversal types on birds and dragons. The order of the day seems to be scale, but there are some cool scenes, like rabbit people bowing for some reason.\n\n\nScale is nice, but I’d like to see more about how it will differentiate itself from other survival sandbox games. Particularly No Man’s Sky. It’s a pretty full genre right now, and “big map” isn’t really the selling point it used to be. However, Hello Games has learned a lot from the constant development of No Man’s Sky.\n\n\nLight No Fire has no announced release window, and the only announced platform right now is PC.\n\nThe post Hello Games unveils massive open-world multiplayer game, Light No Fire appeared first on Destructoid.",

Starr will also be returning for the upcoming Warframe 1999.\n\n\n\n\nI've always been so intrigued with the story of Warframe and it looks like this brings it to the next level.

          "description": "We'll get to explore Dead by Daylight's world once more through The Casting of Frank Stone, a new title by Behaviour Interactive in partnership with Supermassive Games. \n\n\nFrom the brief glimpse of the game the debut trailer offers, we discover we have a mystery on our hands, and like several titles from Supermassive, your choices will shape the story and outcome. You'll be thrust into Cedar Hills where a group of friends uncover the bloody legacy of Stone. \n\n\nThe game seems to be perfectly positioned to take advantage of Supermassive's greatest skills. Its narrative-based, choice-centered structure is something the studio has had plenty of experience with. With franchises like The Dark Pictures Anthology under its belt, the studio's also no stranger to the horror genre. \n\n\n\n\nThis time around, the terror centers around the depths of a steel mill in Oregon where the sadistic actions of a serial killer spawn horrors beyond comprehension. If you're looking for something to raise the hairs on your neck, this seems like a title worth checking out. \n\n\nThe Casting of Frank Stone launches in 2024 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. \n\nThe post Horror game The Casting of Frank Stone unveiled appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During The Game Awards, Sega dropped a lucid hallucination of a trailer briefly highlighting five games allegedly in development. This includes a new Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi. The also tease a “and more.”\n\n\nThe games go by in a flash. We see a Jet Set Radio that looks pretty on point with colorful graphics and familiar city environments. Then there’s a full 3D Streets of Rage. Afterward, we see a stylish 2D Shinobi. Next is a 3D Golden Axe without a sexy panther man or centaur in sight. Finally, we get to Crazy Taxi, which seemingly highlights multiplayer.\n\n\n\n\nAs excited as I am for some of these announcements, a few of them look kind of off. Specifically Streets of Rage and Crazy Taxi. What makes me worry is that Sega has previously cited a “Fortnite-style” service model, specifically referring to Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. Live service model, friends. Hopefully, they’ve changed their ways and we can eventually be legitimately excited to see these games return.\n\n\nNone of the games have a release date, but Sega says they’ll share more soon.\n\nThe post Sega throws in the kitchen sink with five game announcements appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There have been some cool things revealed at the 2023 Game Awards. As you might have seen, I've written about some of them. But I'm here to tell you all that a new game in the Mana series has been revealed, and it practically made me jump out of my chair.\n\n\nVisions of Mana is a brand new entry in the Mana series, which to this point has mostly survived off remakes and a failed gacha game. This new game, from the little we've seen so far, looks like everything I'd want in a new Mana game. There's some flashy Action-RPG combat, a world full of whimsy and magic, and what looks like a variety of spells courtesy of some familiars. It's all huge Secret of Mana vibes and I am here for it.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Mana series has struggled in the past, I can't help but have high hopes for this one. Some may remember that Secret of Mana was one of my picks for the best SNES games ever, and I'd love to see this series get a modern twist on that classic charm I loved so much in my younger years. Anything can happen, of course. We only have a small trailer to analyze, after all. But my fingers are very crossed for this one.\n\n\nVisions of Mana will release in 2024. Stay tuned as we learn more about Visions of Mana.\n\nThe post Square Enix’s Mana series returns with Visions of Mana in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its next action game Rise of the Ronin arrives on March 22, 2024.\n\n\nThe new game certainly looks up Team Ninja's alley, with plenty of fast combat, slicing, and dicing. It's been known for a while, but now, we finally know when the game arrives.\n\n\nAt tonight's The Game Awards 2023, we got a new trailer looking at the title. Set during a time where the country is divided, it follows one ronin who could have a hand in shaping Japan's future.\n\n\n\n\nComing off the fairly well-received Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Ronin does look like Team Ninja trying to keep the string of excellent action games going. But it's headed into a crowded 2024, with one particular competitor that it now shares a release date with: Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\n\nWhether you going for one, the other, or both, it does look like we won't be hurting for action RPGs in the new year.

However, once the gameplay kicks in, we get a glimpse of an ARPG-style perspective of our protagonist running through some scenery and fighting enemies.

Ninja Theory was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, so it's no surprise that the studio's upcoming game will only be available on PC and Xbox Series X/S. \n\n\n\n\nThe latest trailer doesn't offer new story information, but it does show us what a visual feast the sequel will be. It also gives us a glimpse of some of the combat which appears to be much more impactful and bloodier than its predecessor.\n\n\nThe game continues the tale of Senua, a warrior who travels through Helhein to recover the soul of her lover. Her journey is far from straightforward, as she must deal with the Furies in her head that can both help and harm her. The game was lauded for its unique gameplay elements and its well-researched depiction of Psychosis. \n\n\nIf you're interested in jumping into Ninja Theory's latest offering, you'll be able to pick it up day one on Game Pass. \n\nThe post Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 receives stunning new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Clive and the gang follow the origins of a mysterious crystal to a strange ruin filled with deadly defenses tied to Eikons and plenty of monsters. Rising Tide is set to launch in Spring 2024 and is a bit more mysterious, but we do see Clive taking on what may be the scariest enemy in all of Final Fantasy: Tonberry King.

          "description": "The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.\nZau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.\n\nThe world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.\nSalim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.\nThe trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.",

Check out the latest trailer below.\n\n\nIn The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets.

The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.\nThere's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

          "description": "Developer Sharkmob, makers of the battle royale Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodhunt, have revealed a new open-world extraction shooter called Exoborne.\nThe game is a tactical shooter set in an apocalyptic Earth that is being torn asunder by extreme forces of nature, such as massive tornadoes and lightning storms. These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nExoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). \nThe gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.\nCharacters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.\nExborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.",

The more missions cleared, the tougher the bosses, but defeating them and finishing missions earns players powerful gear and abilities. \nThe First Berserker: Khazan will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. \nWhat do you think of The First Berserker: Khazan's reveal trailer?

This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).\nLuckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.\nBut the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.",

Like the Persona franchise, Metaphor: ReFantazio features all the style and substance you'd expect, with excellent UI and font styling. A new trailer released during The Game Awards 2023 reveals it's coming in the fall of next year. \nStudio Zero is handling the development of the title, with Atlus publishing it, and it's clear the team is taking inspiration from Atlus' Persona series, especially its latest, Persona 5. However, despite the visual similarities, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand new game set in its own fantasy universe. \nCheck out the latest Metaphor: ReFantazio trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's plenty to be excited about in this new Atlus IP. Between the fast-paced and stylish turn-based combat, excellent voice acting, and great music from composer Shoji Meguro (whose credits include Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5), Metaphor: ReFantazio is easily one of the most anticipated titles for 2024.\nFor more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer.

Revealed during The Game Awards 2023, Windblown's most striking feature, other than being the next game from the team behind Dead Cells, is its animated art style. \nThe game itself drops the 2.5 nature of Dead Cells for a more top-down, isometric approach with 3D action, and it looks great. It's due out on PC early access sometime in 2024. Other platforms were not mentioned. \nCheck out the Windblown reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nIn Windblown, players control a Leaper on a mission to defend the Ark from a \"very aggro Vortex.\" You can absorb memories of fallen warriors, according to Motion Twin, and then put them to good use by infusing their skills into your weapons.

There's no new trailer showcasing how the game runs on Switch, but Saber did release a few screenshots of the port. \n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance first arrived in February 2018 and stars Henry, the son of a blacksmith who embarks on a quest to fight against invaders to avenge the death of his parents and the destruction of his village.

It hits consoles and PC on February 22, 2024. \nPublisher Annapurna Interactive announced this release date today with a new trailer that features Russell talking about the game. Check out the Open Roads release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nA likely reason Open Roads took three years to reveal a release date after its 2020 debut is because its original creative lead, Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Fullbright and director of Gone Home, was accused of cultivating a hostile work environment in 2021, as reported by Polygon. Shortly after the allegations arose, Gaynor stepped back from his role as creative lead and manager. Since then, Open Roads has detached itself from Fullbright, with the small team of developers behind the title going by Open Roads Team.  \nGame Informer spoke to the Open Roads Team in 2022 about these changes and how it was moving forward with the game's development – you can read our in-depth feature about it here. \n\"In Open Roads, Tess [Devers] and Opal [Russell] embark on a road trip adventure to explore a series of long-abandoned properties, unearthing the past,\" the game's description reads on Steam. \"They'll search the ruins of these places that hold buried memories, things Opal has tried for years to forget. And in this search, they'll discover not just the truth they've been seeking, but each other.\" \nOpen Roads hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Febraury 22, 2024. \nAre you going to check out Open Roads next year?

          "description": "Alongside the launch of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 1, Epic Games revealed Lego Fortnite, a new experience that takes the familiarity of Fortnite and mashes it together with Lego for a new survival adventure experience. Today, Epic Games and Lego released a cinematic trailer for Lego Fortnite that reveals crafting, combat, multiplayer team-ups, a massive world to explore, and more. \nThe trailer begins with a standard Fortnite character – Brite Bomber – running into a reality-shifting rift that transports her to a Lego-fied world. There are Lego sheep, castle-like structures, rolling hills and plains, and, unfortunately for this character, a storm. She runs into the castle to discover a crafting bench of sorts where she crafts an axe, and that's where her survival adventure begins.\nCheck out the Lego Fortnite cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, after crafting an axe, she creates a cabin for shelter, a pen for the Lego sheep, an entire garden, and a bonfire to cook some food. It's not long before banana character Peely (also Lego-fied) shows up, and after hearing the howls of some nearby wolves, the two craft some weapons. From here, the duo meets two others, and together, all four of them set off on a survival adventure that brings them over snowy mountains, into a desert, and eventually, into a cavernous mine where they run into deadly skeletons and a massive monster. \nThe trailer's cinematics end there, cutting to a Lego Fortnite title screen that reveals the new experience goes live in Fortnite tomorrow, December 7. \nLego Fortnite is just one of three new Fortnite experiences revealed alongside Chapter 5 of the Battle Royale mode. Also joining the Fortnite multiverse of experiences is Rocket Racing, a new racing mode, and Fortnite Festival, a new music-centric experience. \nAre you excited for Lego Fortnite? Let us know in the comments below!",

Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.\n>",
