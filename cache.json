In some ways, it feels inaccurate to say Call of Prypiat is the best of the three because it so effectively capitalises on the groundwork laid by Shadow of Chornobyl, but it’s a brilliant, welcome return to atmospheric exploration and emergent horror, with a reduced focus on firefights.\nAn intro cinematic recaps the real and fictional events that led to the opening of the Zone’s mysterious centre. The military has enacted ‘Project Fairway’ to beat the other factions and reach the area first. Predictably, this doesn't go well and Major Alexander Degtyarev, an ex-Stalker, is sent to investigate crashed helicopters scattered across the Prypiat outskirts.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, okay, we might mix things up a bit with the odd sprinkling of ‘tetromino’, just to be nice.\nAnyway, Tetris. It’s often been described as one of, if not the greatest game of all time thanks to its unrivalled approachability and remarkable staying power.

In it, he describes Nintendo's actions as \"a clear case of bullying\" against Pocketpair, citing the former's status as a \"far older and larger company\" with \"extensive experience in patent prosecution and patent infringement litigation\" (thanks, GameRant).\nIt was recently revealed that Nintendo would be seeking an injunction against Palworld to halt sales in Japan, with the additional possibility of Nintendo looking to escalate the dispute in further jurisdictions. The company is also seeking a payment of 5 million yen with an additional 5 million going to The Pokémon Company, totalling the equivalent of around $66K. Although the monetary damages are said to be negligible, it is the injunction that could hold the most long-term significance.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

They want to improve your prospects across the entire genre. Though taking a glance at the new Switch port of their distinctly grotesque work, you’d be forgiven for thinking the opposite is true.\nSet deep in a future where pleasure, sin, crime, and more have been eradicated by scientific progress, Angel at Dusk presents an aggressive arcade bullet-hell shooter built around a meticulously repulsive futuristic body horror theme. The levels are formed from tangled masses of pustulating body parts, held together by ribbons of glistening sinew – an aesthetic that carries over to the monstrous enemy craft. Most moments through the game’s various modes, meanwhile, are filled with dense, intense bullet curtains, while elaborate intersecting mechanical systems focus on high-risk play. Hypercasual or cosy, Angel at Dusk is not.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Its introduction pans over a brooding city skyline while describing a dystopian future under threat from “High rolling suitmen. Captains of industry.

Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a semicolon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist?

The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect.

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.\nRead more",

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.\n“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.\nRead more",

Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.\nUntil then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that.

          "description": "The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It's an \"innovative urban walking simulator\" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. \nRead more",

The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.\r\n \nRead more",

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended?

          "description": "Put your hand up if you'd forgotten that every Assassin's Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.\n Read more",

          "description": "Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

That's right: we now know that there's a white Steam Deck OLED coming very soon, and it will be available worldwide.\n\n\nOr, at least as worldwide as the other Steam Deck models have been.

As noted by PC Gamer (and seen on the game's Steam page), you'll need storage capacity to the tune of 150GB.

Still, that's a fair amount of space needed.\n\n\n\n\nTo put it into perspective, Black Ops 6 \"only\" requires 128GB, according to Steam.

The anime's official website and social media handles share the news after Season 2, Episode 5's release.\n\n\nThe trailer shows Sunraku diving back into Nephilim Hollow, one of his favorite trash games. Unlike Shangri-La Frontier, Nephilim Hollow looks to be a mecha fighting game, wherein the players control both the robot and its huge arsenal of weapons.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the trailer, two new cast members join the anime's staff. Rie Takahashi, who voiced Ai Hoshino in Oshi no Ko and Rinsha in Delicious in Dungeon, will be voicing Rust, Nephilim Hollow's current top player. Meanwhile, Mordo, Rust's companion, will be voiced by Kaito Ishikawa, who also voiced Naofumi from The Rising of the Shield Hero.\n\n\nShangri-La Frontier Season 2 story so far\n\n\nImage via IMDB\n\n\nAfter defeating Wethermon the Tombguard in Season 1, Sunraku, Oikatzo, and Arthur Pencilgon established their own clan — Wolfgang. The trio wanted to go after the remaining Colossi. Pencilgon assumed the leader position after losing a game of rock-paper-scissors, then proceeded to form an alliance with Library, SF-Zoo, and Schwarz Vulf.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the trio also went their different ways to accomplish their own tasks. Pencilgon aimed to clear her debt and earn money, while Oikatzo continued to level up and seek his own unique scenario. Sunraku got the Ether Reactor and started training Bilac to become an Ancient Blacksmith. After achieving the said status, Sunraku would task Bilac to repair the Ether Reactor. In turn, the reactor would be used to power the suits found in the Inventoria.\n\n\nSunraku probably returns to the sci-fi game Nephilim Hollow due to the Ether Reactor and the items stashed in Inventoria.\n\n\nShangri-La Frontier Season 2 can be streamed on Crunchyroll or Netflix.\n\nThe post Shangri-La Frontier Season 2 gets new trailer for upcoming arc appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although this was a nice update, many players found that the motion made them queasy, and were stuck with no way to turn it off. \n\n\nWith the 7.1 Crossroads patch, this tilt has been extended to player characters while moving without a mount. This would be horrible news for anyone who is susceptible to motion sickness while gaming if it wasn’t for the fact that 7.1 also introduces a way to turn off the tilting feature altogether. \n\n\nPreviously, we gave some short-term fixes for the motion sickness issue, such as not focusing on your mount while flying, or trying to avoid turning too often. Now, however, I can tell you how to remove the tilt completely. \n\n\n…",

The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits?

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.\nWe are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.\nIf you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam.
