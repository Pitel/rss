          "description": "A promising new sprout.\nTwo years ago, a new developer called Singularity 6—comprised of various ex-Riot, Sony, and Blizzard staff—announced Palia, a “Massively Multiplayer Community Sim” that would aim to bring together the best parts of Stardew Valley and World of Warcraft. Since then, the title has been in early access on PC, and even though it’s still yet to arrive at its 1.0 release, a Switch version has arrived as part of the continued development. After spending some time with it, Palia shows a lot of promise, though it also notably still feels like an unfinished game.\nThe gameplay loop in Palia feels like it falls neatly between the grindiness of an MMO and the sedate pace of a farm sim. You engage in all the expected homesteading tasks, such as fishing, cooking, and tilling your field, to not just acquire gold to spend on some better furniture for your house, but also to progress an ongoing series of chained questlines from various NPCs that gradually lead you deeper into the world of Palia. You’re encouraged to take things at your own pace and engage in the activities that interest you, though fulfilling quests is usually the quickest way to secure yourself some ‘renown’ currency that can later be spent at a shrine to increase your focus meter. Focus is what you get when you eat food you cook for yourself, and this consumable resource will ensure that your labor will be rewarded with additional experience for as long as it lasts.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Outlined by @Pokemon_cojp (via @SerebiiNet), the first issue to be fixed will be an input drop-out when levelling up a sub-level 30 Inkay using a Candy.

Arriving on Nintendo's console one year after its PC and Xbox launch, it puts you in the shoes of a 'ye olde' village alchemist running a store and following a daily cycle of harvesting ingredients and crafting with them.\nAs the alchemist, you may be asked to create potions for farmers, battle mages, hunters, or even something a little darker, like a potion of necromancy. There’s a morality scoring system of sorts. If you serve customers with evil intentions, your morality rating will go down and more ne'er-do-wells will come to you.

          "description": "My Steam Wrapped listed Baldur's Gate 3 and Vampire Survivors as my top two games of 2023. If Epic Games and my Switch were involved, Fortnite and Persona 5 Royal would've absolutely been included in the lineup, too. Motivation has lain mostly in co-op capers with friends, hangs with virtual pals, or in the battle royale-verse. Otherwise, nothing has truly given me the itch.\nBut I think 2024 could be a big one for me. Not only are a number of upcoming RPGs right up my alley, they align with new and existing motivations: hangs with pals and Japanese language learning. For the first time, I'm excited to embrace the grind both in-game and outside of it.\nRead more",

          "description": "My Remnant 2 character is dangerously close to joining the vast pantheon of characters I've left in limbo, just after completing the tutorial - a race of outcasts we might call the Abandonians, kicking their heels at campfires and savepoints, while I drift guiltily back to older games I've already completed several times over. It's not that I dislike Gunfire's sci-fantasy co-op shooter - the multiple-dimension premise is pleasantly loopy, and I like the variety of procgen landscapes. There just aren't enough hours in the day, not when I'm replaying Into The Breach for the 14th time. Still, perhaps the introduction of a new mode built for quickfix, story-free sessions could persuade me to give 2023's 24th best game another whirl? \r\n\n \nRead more",

Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. \r\n\n\r\nAs a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year. This introduces a new subterranean playspace, the Ringing Deeps, and is the first in a trilogy of expansions called The Worldsoul Saga. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too. That's why I ended up with two of them - one in black and one in pink - and I still use them on the regular for Counter-Strike 2, Valorant and Warzone. \nRead more",

One of which transforms into a mouse.

That performance - and extremely modest power draw and a reasonable price - has caused the 7800X3D to become the best selling CPU by a huge margin according to a German PC part retailer. \nAnyway, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to drop in price. Recently we reported on a reduction in the UK, and now it's time for the US to get a turn on the deals train with a new asking price of just $339.99 - a full 40% off its US MSRP. That's a great price for a CPU that even comes with the breathtaking Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. \nRead more",

Even before these systems became du jour, however, shooters often required you to be good at them before you unlocked their real pleasures, whether by perfecting your rocket timing in Quake or memorising level layouts in Counter-Strike.\r\n\nThe Finals' real master stroke, I think, is that it has found a design that lets it be generous with power - even while containing an unlock system, a battle pass, and a not insignificant skill floor.

It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. \nOnce you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller. \nRead more",

Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as \"boomer shooters\" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.\nI reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.\nRead more",

You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? \"No.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company's activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it's less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. \r\n\n\r\nIn short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio's future.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work. However, as the new H-series parts also integrate Intel Arc graphics for the first time, there is some interesting potential for them to transform lightweight ultrabooks into viable gaming laptops.\nRead more",

          "description": "Video game openings have always been a source of fascination for me. As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? \nIn revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.\nRead more",

As a child, my family didn't have much money and I didn't get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, \"You've not played insert game before?\" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?\nFor me, approaching Doom was cathartic. Playing a game that's older than myself was certainly an experience, but I was shocked at how well it holds up. \nRead more",

It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.\nBut I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.\nNow, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.\nRead more",

          "description": "A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. \r\n\n\r\nIn the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is \"nope\" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up. \r\n \nRead more",

This book contains scenes of graphic violence!\" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. \"Knee-deep in the dead!\" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.\nThe cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve \"Body Bag\" Behling and Michael \"Splatter\" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: \"Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'\"\nRead more",

I think that the popularity of \"looting\", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.\nI distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.\nRead more",

It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.\nNow, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then.

          "description": "The party poppers are out, the finger food is ready and waiting to be served, and the guest list for Doom's 30th birthday party is well and truly set. Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. \nSo Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000. Here's every classic Doom enemy ranked on a scale of the most miserable wallflowers to the life and (undead) soul of the party.\nRead more",

Apologies, I realise that reference is more appropriate to Paradox's other recent strategy release, Star Trek: Infinite, but I don't know the Stellaris fiction well enough to think of an appropriate in-joke. If you are similarly lacking in Stellaris knowledge, please rejoice in the fact that Nexus is a stripped-down, sped-up, turn-based version of the legendary space sim, which emphasises snappy tactical and strategic relationships over backstory. \nRead more",

Do protokolů pro vzdálený přístup přinesl ověřování a důvěrnost a nyní je široce používán.

But where things become much more interesting -- and competitive -- with Meteor Lake is on the integrated graphics side now featuring Arc Graphics. The benchmarks today is our first look at the new Meteor Lake Arc Graphics with the Core 7 Ultra 155H while comparing it to the RDNA3 integrated graphics found with the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U as well as the prior generation Intel integrated graphics.",

According to The Verge, Instead of appointing a new replacement, the top Activision Blizzard executives will now report to Microsoft's game content and studios president Matt Booty. Several more higher-level Activision Blizzard employees will also leave the company in the new year with departures planned through March 2024.\n\n\nA lot of changes up top\n\n\nIt looks like the ripple effects of Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard will really go into full effect in the new year. In an internal memo, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer highlighted some of the changes including the departure of Lulu Meservey at the end of January and Humam Sakhini at the end of December. In March, Vice Chariman of Activision Blizzard Thomas Tippl will leave the company as well as Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, Chief People Officer Julie Hodges, Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton, and CFO Armin Zerza.\n\n\nEnd of an era\n\n\nAfter 32 years with the company, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's reign comes to an end. His resignation comes just two months after the acquisition of the company by Microsoft. After joining Activision in 1991, Kotick was responsible for several larger acquisitions in the industry including the Vivendi Games merger in 2008 that created Activision Blizzard and the acquisition of mobile game developer King.\n\n\nHowever, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows with Kotick. Just a few weeks ago his company agreed to pay over $54 million in a settlement with the California Civil Rights Department to settle a very messy workplace discrimination lawsuit.\n\n\nKotick will receive a farewell payout of at least $15 million when he leaves the company next week.\n\nThe post Bobby Kotick will resign from Activision Blizzard on December 29 appeared first on Destructoid.",

For years, we’ve essentially been using different configurations of the same thing.

          "description": "2023 brought a lot of classic games back into the fold, but I always knew one certain title would inevitably take the crown for best remake/remaster. Resident Evil 4 rides a fine line of feeling old and new to an impeccable degree, and I’ve got to admit, it’s a heck of a remake.\n\n\nResident Evil 4 is one of those games that transcends the legacy of the Resident Evil series itself. Personally, it wasn’t the first Resident Evil game I played, but it was the first one I finished. Its combination of action, RPG elements, and incredible campy dialogue just worked for me. And judging from how I’ve seen others talk about this game for almost 20 years, I’m clearly not alone there. It’s one of those games that frequently comes up in “greatest game of all time” conversations, and at one point in my l…",

          "description": "Sawaki Takeyasu and Ignition Games' El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron somehow came out over 12 years ago. Takeyasu's company Crim purchased the rights a couple years after launch, and now the HD remaster finally has an April 28, 2024 date for Nintendo Switch. \n\n\nCrim announced the date for the port along with publisher Rainy Frog. El Shaddai will hit Switch both physically and digitally in Japan, including a physical deluxe edition priced at ¥8,250 (about US$57). Paying a little extra nets you the game along with a drama CD that comes with a script. Whether this is your first time ascending or you've been looking for an excuse to do so again, you can see more in the release date trailer. \n\n\n\n\nEl Shaddai made its debut in 2011 to somewhat mixed reactions. It's a uniquely stylized action game that isn't necessarily going to be for everyone, but those who vibe with it are probably still thinking about it today. It had a pretty big promotional and crossover push at the time, including one that saw Japanese clothing brand Edwin release some pricey 503 Zero jeans in both Enoch and Lucifel styles. Unfortunately, none of the Switch releases come with themed clothing, so you'll have to hit eBay for a gently used pair. \n\n\nOutside of the bonuses included with the Japanese physical editions, it doesn't seem as if there's much in the way of new content here. If good ol' reliable El Shaddai—complete with its rock, paper, scissors combat and blend of 3D and 2D sections—sounds like a solid enough hook in 2024, mark your calendars for April. \n\nThe post El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron HD Remaster makes Switch debut in April 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whether you love it or hate it, Starfield is one of 2023's most notable releases. For all the things that it does well, there's loads of stuff that Bethesda could improve upon, too. It sounds like improvements should be coming in 2024, though, according to the company's latest announcement.\n\n\nWork on the company's latest flagship appears to continue in the background. Many of its most pressing improvements have already been outlined in the days and weeks prior, but a few more precious details have just been provided, suggesting what else might be coming.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Bethesda's already confirmed some of the stuff that's coming to Starfield in 2024, such as new travel options, city maps, and a rough update cadence, there are some curious new tidbits present here. Specifically, the following:\n\n\n\nNew ship customization options.\n\n\nNew gameplay options that allow further difficulty adjustments.\n\n\n\nBethesda's not provided any detailed information on whether the team intends to simply add new customizations and difficulty sliders, or go all-in on the concept. A survival mode such as the one featured in Fallout 4 is something that players have expressed interest in, for example.\n\n\nBethesda's plans for Starfield in 2024\n\n\nFurther, Bethesda's previously confirmed update cadence, with new patches coming in every six weeks or so, won't be kicking in before February. This suggests that there's nothing new coming to Starfield in the next two months or so.\n\n\nOf course, Starfield's first confirmed expansion pack, Shattered Space, is still on the way. No date has been set for that yet, but the post says it's part of the 2024 plan.\n\n\nBethesda's end-of-year post outlining the near future of Starfield development could, therefore, either be taken with a dose of skepticism or hype, depending on one's opinion of what's already there. Things really could go either way for Starfield's post-launch support.\n\nThe post Bethesda aims to update Starfield roughly every six weeks in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You have 24 hours to claim it.\n\n\nI’ve heard of DNF Duel but know next to nothing about it. There was a lot of PR stuff coming at us in the lead-up and some excitement around the launch, but I think the fighting game market is pretty jammed up with heavy hitters to the point where it maybe didn’t catch fire. It’s a tough market for newcomers. It’s a spin-off of Dungeon & Fighter, which I also don’t know a whole lot about.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I hear the acronym “DNF,” my mind first goes to “did not finish,” and then afterward goes to “Duke Nukem Forever.”\n\n\nI do know something about the Epic Games Store. It gives away a lot of free games and doesn’t make any money for Epic. I installed it for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed and uninstalled it once that game came to Steam.\n\n\nDNF Duel does seem like a good time, though. You certainly can’t argue with the price of free. However, you’ll have to act now-ish, since the sale is only for 24 hours. It ends on December 21, 2023, at 11am EST.\n\nThe post DNF Duel is the next 2023 Epic Holiday freebie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Which makes sense! It’s an epilogue, after all, so it would be easy to spoil things about the ending. Speaking of which, here are the requirements to access the new epilogue content:\n\n\n-Complete a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet.\n\n\n-Complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk.\n\n\n\n\nThe post suggests that the epilogue takes place in Kitakami and it’s a “new adventure,” but not much besides that.\n\n\nAs I said, I didn’t play any of the DLC. Timothy “Windchime” Monbleau did just recently and sounded like he had the last vestiges of optimism forcibly sucked from his soul. I welcome him to the void. There is plenty of room. I really don’t know how else to describe his critique of the expansion. If you want to know what it looks like when the lights go out in a human heart, it's a worthwhile read.\n\n\nHowever, if you have different thoughts on The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, you might appreciate having the story tied up in a bow. Heck, maybe Mr. Monbleau will feel better about his agonizing experience with BBQs once it’s all wrapped up. Who can say?\n\n\nWhat I do know is that the epilogue of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be released on January 11, 2024. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are available on Switch.

          "description": "Developer Eyeguys and publisher Santa Ragione released the \"treacherous visual novel\" Mediterranea Inferno on PC in August 2023, and now it has a date for consoles. The latest announcement has the game hitting PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on March 5, 2024.\n\n\nMediterranea Inferno follows the act of Eyeguys' 2020 visual novel Milky Way Prince: The Vampire Star, which tackled similarly weighty themes. You can see some of its idiosyncrasies on display in the console announcement and launch date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nThe story of Mediterranea Inferno kicks off as three young 20-something guys reconnect after a period of isolation that's all too familiar. This is a post-pandemic yarn that reflects collective trauma through the trio of Claudio, Andrea, and Mida, who are attempting to enjoy their Southern Italy retreat. \n\n\nAlong the way you'll get to choose what they do each day, from visiting the local cemetery to relaxing by the pool, soaking in an endless summer that paves the way for insight into their psyches and unlocks hidden fears, obsessions, and the reality of dashed ambitions. \n\n\nComing to grips with inner demons is an inevitable side effect of rediscovery in Mediterranea Inferno, apparently. Creator Lorenzo Redaelli produced hundreds of illustrations for the game along with handling the writing and music, so much like Milky Way Prince, there's a very personal touch behind it all. We have a little ways to go before that March console launch approaches, but in the meantime Mediterranea Inferno is available via Steam and Epic Games Store. \n\nThe post Mediterranea Inferno visual novel sets console debut for March 5, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Over 50 million units have been sold through consumers just over three years since the console launched back in November 2020. According to Sony, the console experienced strong sales momentum this year due to the release of popular games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Achieving this PS5 sales milestone is a testament to the unwavering support of the global PlayStation community and their passion for the incredible experiences created by the talented developers from PlayStation Studios and our partners. We’re grateful for all of our players who have joined the PS5 journey so far, and we’re thrilled that this is the first holiday season since launch that we have a full supply of PS5 consoles – so anyone who wants to get one can get one.\"\n-Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\n\n\nThe milestone puts the PlayStation 5 console at the 15th best-selling gaming console of all time if you go purely by units sold. This puts it just above the SNES which sold a little over 49 million and behind the Xbox One which has sold about 58 million units since its release in 2013. For comparison, the best-selling console of all time is the PlayStation 2 which sold over 155 million units in its lifetime.\n\nThe post PlayStation 5 surpasses 50 million units sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

And later, the impeccable Chris Carter took the reins on the first DLC pack, The Teal Mask, who concluded that it wasn’t as good as The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds and also gave a 6/10. \n\n\nWe’re not necessarily bound to each other’s scores as an outlet, but sometimes things just…",

          "description": "Developer Creepy Jar, best known for their open-world survival sim Green Hell, officially revealed their next title as a sci-fi base builder titled StarRupture. Earlier this year Creepy Jar briefly teased the game during the PC Gaming Show though it was codenamed Chimera. In StarRupture, players will build up their base on an alien planet stuck in a catastrophic cycle of destruction by a nearby star.\n\n\n\n\nBase-building meets tower defense\n\n\nPlayers take on the role of a convict exiled from Earth with a sentence of mining and expanding industrial production while researching new technology on a hospitable but hostile new planet. As players build up their base with complex machinery, they will also need to fight waves of hostile enemy monsters. StarRupture can be played solo or cooperatively with up to four players.\n\n\n\n\"We wanted to come up with a new title that more accurately described the dangerous sci-fi world we’re creating. We had to break away from the mythology-based roots of Chimera and we landed on StarRupture. Originating from the base word ‘rupture’—as in a break or a disturbance—the new name also closely ties to the name of the planet’s star which is aptly named, Ruptura.\n-Krzysztof Kwiatek, Founder and CEO of Creepy Jar\n\n\n\nThere's no release timeframe for StarRupture yet, but developer Creepy Jarp plans to continue releasing devlogs in the coming months as development progresses.\n\nThe post Green Hell developer Creepy Jar reveals new sci-fi base builder StarRupture appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After a steady stream of leaks following the game's “closed alpha tech test” in late November, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League developer Rocksteady has issued an official statement urging players to “avoid spoilers where they can.”\n\n\nRocksteady addressed the situation via their Twitter account, writing that “it is very disappointing to see details being shared” and asking players to avoid them until the game officially releases on February 2. Check out the full statement down below:\n\n\n\n\nEven though the alpha test that ran from November 30 to December 3 only featured a small part of the campaign to test online infrastructure, some plot details found their way online. Several details, including several well-known characters from the DC ensemble who’re making an appearance in the game and more, have reportedly been leaked online.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time details about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have surfaced on the internet against the dev's wishes. An earlier leak this year involved the game's online features and battle pass. Suffice it to say, that didn't garner a whole lot of positive reception for Rocksteady.\n\n\nWarner Bros. is issuing copyright strikes to pull the images that are circulating, but if you want to avoid spoilers absolutely, you may need to mute the social media pages related to this game, or the Suicide Squad and Justice League in general, for the time being.\n\n\nIn fact, I’d avoid reading the replies to that Rocksteady tweet too. I certainly regret not doing so now.\n\nThe post Rocksteady acknowledges Suicide Squad leaks, asks players to not post spoilers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Skyrim and the whole Elder Scrolls series provides a near-infinite potential for modding. Some fan projects – such as Tamriel Rebuilt – expand on the original games and lore, and one other monstrous endeavor has been making great progress.\n\n\nIn the most recent developer video diary, the Skyrim Rebuilt team has shown off the work that's so far been carried out in expanding Cyrodiil, the region where Oblivion takes place. Over the course of 35 minutes, we get to see exactly what's been implemented and what's left to do.\n\n\n\n\nFor example: the city of Skingrad has had nearly all 33 interiors finalized and all 86 NPCs and 108 scenes have been completed, with focus now shifting to finishing quests. It's quite astounding the work that's been put in by the team, yet there's still lots to be done.\n\n\nWhat is Skyrim Rebuilt?\n\n\nIt should be noted that this massive project is not a recreation of Oblivion inside Skyrim's engine. Instead, Skyrim Rebuilt will encompass a complete expansion of the continent of Tamriel which will allow you to travel to regions from the other TES games. Cyrodiil is just one of the many provinces that's being worked on.\n\n\nThis means that The Elder Scrolls 4's story will not be present as the region is part of Skyrim's lore and history (i.e. 200 years after Oblivion). This also means there are numerous changes, with the most notable one being the complete recreation of Kvatch, the settlement that's been destroyed in TES4.\n\n\nAs for when it will be released, the team is unable to give an answer. You can already download the city of Bruma if you want to get a taste of what's been worked on, but as you can imagine, a project like this is going to take a long time to complete. And it's been in development since 2012. The team is interested in volunteers if you have the skills to help out.\n\nThe post Beyond Skyrim project shows the impressive progress made on remaking Cyrodiil appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, there's been some developments on that front, and it looks as though Team Green might be launching several new products come early 2024.\n\n\nAccording to a report from Videocardz, Nvidia is set to launch three new GPUs beginning the second week of January. An embargo list shows that SUPER variants of the 4070, 4070 Ti, and 4080 will be releasing throughout the month.\n\n\nImage via Videocardz.\n\n\nIt also appears as though the company will be releasing them in stages, starting with reviews and following this up with on-shelf launches soon after.\n\n\nA SUPER start to the year\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Nvidia has not confirmed whether the 4000 series SUPER cards are indeed being launched over the coming weeks. With that, we may have to err on the side of caution and say to hold back expectations until official word comes through.\n\n\nThat said, an RTX 4000 SUPER range has been rumored for some time, so many would not be surprised to see a line-up of SKUs coming in 2024.\n\n\nThese supposed new Ada Lovelace cards will likely offer a slight boost to their non-SUPER counterparts. The report from Videocardz suggests they'll boast an increase in CUDA cores and maybe a little bit more RAM.\n\n\nThere's also said to be a 6GB version of the RTX 3060 rumored to be launching sometime in Q1 2024. Again, it's best to wait until Nvidia gives a statement about what's actually in the pipeline.\n\nThe post Several Nvidia RTX 4000 SUPER cards supposedly launching in January appeared first on Destructoid.",

Insomniac, victims of a ransomware attack, has now seen details about Wolverine and other major projects shared, alongside personal employee information.\n\n\nPer Cyber Daily, which is reportedly in contact with the group behind the leak, the leak was uploaded in parts and shared details on many upcoming projects. This includes development footage of Wolverine, files from the recent Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and details about upcoming projects, including a new publishing agreement for another Marvel property, X-Men.\n\n\nAlongside unreleased game documentation, employee info also seems to have leaked because of this hack. Cyber Daily's report mentions internal HR documents, including employment forms, and Slack screenshots.\n\n\nThe hackers purportedly behind the attack made a threat to publish more, after releasing a few verifying materials, and asked a sum for the data.\n\n\nWe've reached out to Sony for comment.\n\n\nThe industry's response\n\n\n\nFollowing the leaks, developers and even studio accounts have come out in support of Insomniac. Remedy Entertainment emphasizes the \"truly disgraceful and shameful\" leak of employee's personal info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWushu Studios, which has worked on State of Decay 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Forza Horizon 5, and more also sent love and support. \"Game creators work tirelessly to create works of art & entertainment for everyone,\" the studio writes. \"To see any team rewarded for this with malicious attacks & blackmail is cruel.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Cory Barlog shared a simple message of support for those at Insomniac.\n\n\n\n\nWe've seen some absolutely massive data breaches over the last few years.

Warhammer fan and actor Henry Cavill had been linked to the project after it was revealed he would no longer be playing Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher. It now looks like he will in fact be part of the process as an Executive Producer.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the community post, everything is still in the early stages but is now officially underway. Creative details are the focus now as the first script is being written and pushed into production. The post goes on to claim that an elite band of screenwriters with their own passions for Warhammer have been assembled to bring the various stories of Warhammer 40,000 to TV and movies. All led by Henry Cavill as Executive Producer who will be \"bringing his pen, sword and/or spear to the project.\"\n\n\nWhile it's clear anything tangible is still a way out, this is awesome news. Warhammer 40,000 is an insanely lore-rich IP and I'm honestly surprised it has taken this long.

Beyond that, he starred in a number of TV and film roles going back 35 years.\n\n\nRemedy has also given their condolences, stating, “We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of our beloved friend and collaborator James McCaffrey, the iconic voice of Max Payne and Alex Casey. His remarkable talent not only gave life to our characters but also left an enduring impact on our community. Our hearts go out to his family in this time of loss.”\n\n\n\n\nWhile his list of roles in video game voice acting is somewhat short, his impact was massive. As Max, McCaffrey gave life to the character’s melancholic, neo-noir brooding, even providing motion capture animation in Max Payne 3. In the same way I have trouble hearing Batman without the voice of Kevin Conroy, I can’t imagine Max without McCaffrey behind the vocals. This has been a sad year when it comes to who we’ve lost in the industry, both in terms of their contributions to beloved characters and those behind the scenes who make it happen. \n\n\nSam Lake, who provided the face for Max in the first game, perhaps said it best on Twitter: “He was a key part of the Remedy family. He was a brilliant actor. No one could do what he did better than him.”\n\n\nLead image via Remedy.\n\nThe post Max Payne voice actor James McCaffrey dies at 65 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Chris Avellone, the former chief creative officer and co-founder of Fallout: New Vegas developer Obsidian Entertainment, has revealed that the company tried to make an Elder Scrolls game in a similar vein. In a thread confirming an old tweet uncovered by 80 Level, Avellone discussed details about the proposal.\n\n\n\n\nHe also compared the idea to the way Infinity Ward and Treyarch handled alternate Call of Duty games during that generation, with Bethesda developing a main game and Obsidian working on something that would offer more Elder Scrolls adventures, like Fallout: New Vegas did for that series. \n\n\nAccording to Avellone, the idea didn't gain traction with Bethesda, and he suggests that the Starfield studio wasn't happy with the reception that Fallout: New Vegas received, \"good and bad.\"\n\n\nAlthough Fallout: New Vegas has become highly regarded over the years since its release, there was initially some backlash toward the game due to bugs and game breaking issues. \n\n\nAfter years of patches and updates, Fallout: New Vegas has gotten the recognition that it deserves. It's disappointing to think of what we could have had if this had ultimately panned out. It has been over a decade since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released, and it doesn't look like we'll get to play The Elder Scrolls VI anytime soon. \n\n\nIf only we had an Obsidian-developed Elder Scrolls game to fill the decade plus gap between releases. It seems like Bethesda missed a trick with that one. Maybe Obsidian's (remarkably Elder Scrolls looking) fantasy RPG, Avowed, can fill that hole in my heart.\n\nThe post Fallout New Vegas dev says studio once pitched an Elder Scrolls spin-off appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.\nSince the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.\n\n\nThe holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. \nThe milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. \nIt’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March. We're curious to see what else Sony has up its sleeve as the next year progresses.",

Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.\nApparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and a video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.\nRocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we've posted in full below. \nIt’s always a bummer to see leaks of this nature happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. \nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass. \nYou can watch the game’s most recent trailer from the 2023 Game Awards here.",

This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. \nBeyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's One Piece Odyssey review.",

Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.\nLuckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:\n\nConcept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images.

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition didn’t launch in the greatest state, but after months of fixes, the game has been deemed ready to launch on mobile devices. The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.\nLike all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. \nIn addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release. You can watch the game’s debut trailer here.",

It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's \"Show Me Mastery\" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. \n\"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?\" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. \nThere is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.\nDecember 12, 2023\nGod of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. \nYou can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live. \nAre you playing God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC?

Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.\nThe noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.\nMouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. \n\n\nMouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. \nIt was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too. \npic.twitter.com/y6dtVkBvNI\nDecember 12, 2023\n\"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close,\" ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. \"We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.\" \nPierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business \"has blossomed in different ways,\" noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. \"That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.\" \nFor a recap of the history of E3, read The Washington Post's full story here.

More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. \nWhile many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. \n\n\nAs you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. \nIf you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer's Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it.

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
