Now it's been reported by Gamebiz.jp that the releases passed six million sales globally in their launch week, which is hugely impressive.\nAs a broad number that's in the same ballpark as Sword and Shield's equivalent results, which suggests that the remakes have held a similar appeal to the previous new-gen releases. That's notable, considering that this figure is a good bit above (about double) the equivalent launch sales for Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Breeding virtual monsters to fight for fun and profit.\nName the first classic game series that centres around collecting, training, and battling monsters against other trainers around the continent that comes into your head. No, we’re not talking about Pokémon — instead we’re looking at Monster Rancher, a series which started in 1997 on the PlayStation and turns 25 next year. So what better way to celebrate that quarter-century than to catch the first two games re-released for Switch? Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX is certainly one of the more unusual games on Switch eShop.\nMonster Rancher, like many series coming out of Japan in the '90s, has a somewhat spotty localisation history. In fact, this is the first time that the original game has ever reached Europe, with the sequel marking the series' debut in that territory (dropping the titular '2' so as not to confuse Europeans). Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX is a pretty faithful port of the first two games, adding in a few quality of life improvements that weren’t a part of the original Western release — such as more save slots and monsters to raise — while keeping the gameplay, sound, and graphics straight out of the PS1 era.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Overpass: Rhythm Roadtrip - published by Quantum Astrophysicists Guild and developed by Studio Bean - is aiming to make its own mark on the genre, targeting a release on Switch and other platforms in 2022.\nAs you can see in the trailer it goes for a slightly different approach, with the viewpoint dreamily gazing out of the window of a car - it's all in the name, to be fair.

Developed by Omega Force — nowadays famous for the long-running Dynasty Warriors series and associated Musou spin-offs/crossovers — and released for N64 back in 1999, it’s probably the least well-known of the Switch Online service’s initial Nintendo 64 offerings; a title that falls under the unflattering banner of being a perceived ripping-off of the venerable Metal Gear Solid. This, however, is inaccurate. There’s a compelling argument that Winback, for all its flaws, is one of the more prominently influential N64 titles, with measurable influence on some of the biggest games of all time.\nThat’s not contrarian gum-flapping, you know. This third-person shooter brings in some innovations that became full-on conventions, and it doesn’t really get the appropriate credit for them. Its cover system, which sees you tap 'A' to get in position behind a wall or a crate or any such scenery, then peer out to take pot-shots? Pure Gears of War. You’ve also got the laser-sight for free aiming, which returned in spectacular style with – most prominently – Resident Evil 4.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This is where refresh rates and response times come in, making your games flow better and feel more reactive.

It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I've been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.\nI was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: \"Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.\" This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I \"enjoyed\" the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn't not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me.

They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.\r\n\n\r\nThat's pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. \r\n\n\r\nThe patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.\r\n \nRead more",

Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she's written a message on the palm of her hand reading \"He is alive\". I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.\nRead more",

In other words, this isn't a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.\nLast year's festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that's where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap. \n \nRead more",

I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\nUnless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade.

People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5's power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can't play anywhere else.\nThe Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5's absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.\nPlease note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a mus…",

Thrilled to announce I’m the voice of Miles “Tails” Prower in #SonicMovie2! Can’t wait for y'all to see him on the big screen.\nDecember 7, 2021\nShe joins stars Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Jim Carrey (Dr. Ivo Robotnik), and James Marsden (Donut Lord... ahem. I mean Tom Wachowski), who will reprise their roles from the first film. Idris Elba is, of course voicing Knuckles the Echidna to round out the trio of animated characters we know of so far. O'Shaughnessey also played Tails in the brief stinger featured at the end 2020's adaptation.\nColleen has been the voice of Tails for quite a few years, first stepping into the flying fox's shoes since 2013 games Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystals. Prior to that, she was the voice of Knuckles Chaotix alum Charmy Bee before also taking on the role of Sonic's stalwart partner.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is slated to hit theaters on April, 8 2022.\nWe're coming up on the end of Sonic's 30th anniversary, and while we know a new game is in the works, there's not much info out about it.

          "description": "When The Last Night premiered during Microsoft's E3 2017 presentation, its cyberpunk-flavored blend of 3D graphics and pixel art dazzled audiences. Unfortunately, developer Odd Tales has hit a lot of roadblocks since then, including losing its publishing partner and raising funding on its own. The Last Night has since occupied the “whatever happened to that game?” bingo card, but it appears Odd Tale is busy prepping to reintroduce the game in the foreseeable future. \nPC Gamer spoke with The Last Night’s creator, Tim Soret, via email last week regarding rumors that the game will appear during The Game Awards on December 9. Soret dismissed these rumors as just that, saying “...The Last Night will be shown next year, not before.\" He doesn’t commit to saying the game will launch in 2022, explaining that he wants to avoid putting pressure on his small team and that they’re carefully building The Last Night “brick by brick” to adapt the game’s visuals for current-gen as well as implementing a suite of accessibility options.\n\"What we know is that for The Last Night comeback in 2022, we make it our mission to blow everyone away by the strength & originality of our proposition.\" says Soret. You can watch the original debut trailer for a reminder of why people really want The Last Night to release.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe Last Night was originally intended to launch in 2018, but Odd Tales split from publisher Raw Fury. Although Odd Tales regained full publishing rights to the game, the divorce seemingly triggered an avalanche of funding and legal issues the team stated it couldn’t publically speak on. Odd Tales even said it had to cancel a trailer intended for the 2018 Game Awards. The Last Night has clearly been through the wringer, but it’s refreshing to hear that it may be climbing out of development hell sooner rather than later.\nThe Last Night is slated to launch on Xbox One and PC. \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

          "description": "Remember when we used to order pizza delivery inside EverQuest II? Final Fantasy XIV is teaming up with GrubHub to offer a new “Eat Pizza” emote for those that use Grubhub’s delivery service from December 9 to December 15. And with all that time you spend waiting in queue to play, you’re sure to work up a powerful appetite! The first 20,000 orders that redeem the code ENDWALKER at checkout not only get the emote, but they also get free delivery on the order (up to $6).\nAll participants get the Eat Pizza emote on December 17th, which can then be redeemed on a Final Fantasy XIV account. You could probably get a code and give it to a friend for the holidays or something, given how this works after you order food. Even though the emote is pizza-related, you can order anything (as long as the order is over $15) for the purposes of scoring the emote code. As you may be playing Final Fantasy XIV, I’d recommend something that won’t get your controller or mouse greasy. The emote itself is sure to be the height of fashion in all those new Endwalker dungeons and raids. You can check out the full promotion details here.\nHave you been playing Endwalker? Are you trying out the Reaper or the Sage? Is a pizza emote an awesome addition to the cool actions you can do in-game, a sign of the apocalypse, or just something to do between feeding your Chocobo?

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop four times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as the goofiest item yet: a flower to fasten to your Spartans helmet.\nThe biggest bundle this week is the Soldier Armor Set for the Mark VII. In the bundle, you will find the epic Tac/Liberty Rig, Tahuna Sands armor coating, sleek soldier helmet design, a variety of attachments including the Mithril visor, and last but not least, the Rocket Rescue stance. This set retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.\nIf you don't want your Spartan to look overly serious, you can purchase the Daisy Delights bundle to add a small stuffed bear to the chest plate and a flower to the helmet. If you want to wear two flowers at once, you can swap out the bear for a yellow rose. This bundle is 1,500 credits.\nAnd who doesn't like pickles? The final bundle called Special Delivery offers a Space Pickle charm, a gold Legend visor (which looks a lot like Master Chief's), and the Into the Breach stance. The final item offered this week is the Chibi Chieftain bundle, which adds cute decals of alien characters to your vehicles, nameplate, weapons, and armor.",

We'll have to wait for the full character breakdown for his release this week to find out if he's any good. Though, Garfield has to be at least ready for this type of game since he's been edgeguarding Odie for 40 years.\nI reviewed Nick Brawl in October, where I found it to be a solid yet flawed platform fighter. Here's an excerpt from the review: \nGarfield looks to be the first of two free characters coming to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, with another unknown combatant coming sometime in the future.

In order to replay campaign missions, you’ll need to start a fresh save. This might be frustrating for completionists as the campaign missions feature collectibles that are easy to miss.

So we made a decision to improve the quality of the single-player campaign to ensure that, as a foundation, that it’s as strong as it possibly could be so that we could then add the other features back in.” \nIf you’re looking to 100% Halo Infinite and unlock all of the campaign-related achievements in your first playthrough, it sounds like you might want to keep a guide handy just in case.\nWhile waiting for Halo Infinite to go live, which is happening a little later than you might expect, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Halo Infinite review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 Xbox Series X games.

Final Fantasy XIV’s growth has led to 25 million registered players, up from 24 million back in October, as reported by Eurogamer. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThis number could rise even more today as the latest expansion, Endwalker, is finally out after launching into early access last week. Hopefully, those players have been paying attention to the information the team behind Final Fantasy XIV has been releasing because the MMO’s servers are currently congested, with some players hitting queue lines as long as 5000-plus players. \nThe team is giving all registered players and those who own Final Fantasy XIV seven days of game time for free to make up for all of the server congestion. The onset of Endwalker has also led to Final Fantasy XIV garnering its largest concurrent player base ever. As noted by Eurogamer, the peak concurrent for the MMO hit an all-time high two days ago, reaching 95,000 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. The previous record happened in July, and it was nearly 30,000 less at 67,000. With Endwalker’s launch happening today, we wouldn’t be surprised if a new concurrent record is reached (assuming the servers can keep up). \nWhile waiting to queue into Endwalker, check out Game Informer’s Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker New Gameplay Today, and then check out this new trailer for the expansion.

          "description": "The first game from Embark Studios, a veteran team led by former EA and Dice head Patrick Söderlund, is set to be revealed this week. The game is called Arc Raiders, and we got a glimpse of what to expect in a cryptic teaser video.\nThe video is one of those “trailer for the trailer” as it states a full reveal is slated for Thursday, December 9. Hey, that’s the same day as The Game Awards — what a funny coincidence. The video shows some third-person shooting, a woman calling for volunteers, and an “Enlist. Resist” tagline. You can watch the teaser in the tweet below.\npic.twitter.com/JPsq7mL4hP\nDecember 6, 2021\nWe first caught wind of Embark’s new game last November, when the studio began hiring for a PvP team-based shooter and shared concept art of the project. It seems safe to assume that Arc Raiders is this project, but we’ll find out for sure soon enough. Embark was formed in 2018 after Söderlund departed EA earlier that same year. The team is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and boasts roughly 200 employees as of November 2020. The company’s mission statement, according to its website, is “to blur the line between playing and making,” and many of the posts have centered on showcasing development tools.\nWhat do you think about this first tease for Arc Raiders? Any guesses as to what kind of game it could be? Share your thoughts in the comments!",

          "description": "With the world's return to The Matrix franchise a couple of weeks away (the time it would take to download a movie on Limewire in the early 2000s), Epic Games is releasing a new experience built on its new engine. Partnering with the cast and crew from the upcoming film, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will show off what the new software can do.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe Matrix Resurrections director Lana Wachowski is involved in bringing this tech showcase to life, and so are the film's stars, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who provide performances for Awakens. The trailer for the Unreal experience is exceptionally short, only providing a couple of seconds of Reeves doing what's demanded of him in a bright white void: questioning existence, asking, \"How do we know what is real,\" which is a question that's probably pointed at his own physical being in the trailer, a near-lifelike recreation of the well-known actor. Or else he's messing with us, and that is actually Keanu on film. To that, I say, kudos for making me question three seconds of footage all day.\nThe Matrix Awakens is available now to pre-load on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Stay tuned for more info on the experience at The Game Awards this Thursday. \nHow hyped are you to return to The Matrix? Will you be stocking up on dark, glossy clothing and tiny sunglasses for the new movie and this UE5 experience? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "A senior executive at Sony was fired after being caught in an alleged pedophile sting video posted online. \nGeorge Cacioppo was a senior vice president of engineering for Sony for over eight years, having worked on products such as the PlayStation Store and more. Over the weekend, the amateur pedophile-busting YouTube channel People v. Preds posted a video online that accused him of trying to meet with a 15-year-old boy. After the video began to pick up steam, Sony told CNET that Cacioppo had been fired. \n“We are aware of the situation and the employee in question has been terminated from employment,” Sony told CNET in a statement on Sunday. \nCNET attempted to contact Cacioppo via his LinkedIn profile but did not receive a comment. At the time of this writing, the former vice president of engineering has not publicly commented on the video or his subsequent termination from Sony. \nPeople v. Preds told Kotaku that its videos are posted online publicly rather than turned into police for an official investigation, because “the police department doesn’t work with ‘Cyber groups’ like us,” and that “that’s when the internet takes over.” However, People v. Preds also told Kotaku that “evidence has been turned into the authorities.” \nThe video, which is still publicly available for viewing, shows Cacioppo in a PlayStation 5 shirt being accused by People v. Preds of trying to meet with a 15-year-old he met on Grindr. CNET says Cacioppo told the 15-year-old that his name was “Jeff” and that “Jeff” gave the teen an address for the two to meet and have sex. \nThe San Diego Police Department has received People v. Preds’ evidence, but police have released no public information regarding this incident. It’s still unclear if this will developer into a case, but regardless, Cacioppo is no longer a Sony employee. \n[Source: CNET]",

          "description": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe finally has a Daredevil and fans of the character will likely recognize the actor behind the mask. \nThat’s because the performer is Charlie Cox, who portrayed the hero across three seasons of Netflix’s Daredevil series, which is technically canon to the MCU. Marvel boss Kevin Feige finally announced the news, long-rumored to be in the works, in an interview with CinemaBlend and in it, he revealed that while Cox’s casting has been announced, where we’ll first see him remains a secret. \n“If you were to see Daredevil in upcoming things, Charlie Cox, yes, would be the actor playing Daredevil,” Feige said. “Where we see that, how we see that, when we see that, remains to be seen.” \nFans have long speculated that Cox would be returning to the role in the MCU, with some hoping he makes a more lawyer-related appearance in Marvel and Sony’s upcoming Spider-Man: No Way Home (Peter Parker is in need of a lawyer, after all, considering he’s been accused of killing Quentin Beck aka Mysterio). Perhaps that’s what Feige is alluding to – it’s also possible that the MCU hasn’t quite figured out Daredevil’s first outing, meaning Feige wouldn’t have much to say on Cox’s role in the universe just yet. \nOnly time will tell, but for those who have watched Daredevil, today’s news is sure to be welcome. Daredevil is largely viewed as Netflix’s best Marvel series, in no small part due to Cox’s role as the vigilante. If you haven’t yet seen Cox as Daredevil, the entire Netflix series is worth watching. Plus, some have speculated that Kingpin, the villain throughout the Daredevil series, might be making an appearance in Marvel’s ongoing Disney+ show, Hawkeye. \n[Source: CinemaBlend]\nAre you excited about Charlie Cox’s return to Daredevil?

He also said that in today’s Xbox ecosystem, Bungie might have stayed with Microsoft. \n“Could we [keep Bungie around] today? I think we could,” Spencer told Axios when asked if Bungie’s departure was inevitable. \nSpencer said that since Bungie’s departure, Xbox has learned a lot but understands why the studio left. \n“At the time, they had big ambitions,” Spencer said. “They had sold their business for a certain amount of money. They saw what Halo turned into. And it’s like, ‘Okay, Microsoft benefited more than Bungie did from the success of Halo.’ There’s no other story that can be written there.” \nSpencer continued and said he understands the appeal of becoming independent, citing that Bungie probably felt like it had another Halo-like franchise in them. \n“If you’re saying, ‘Hey, I think I’ve got another one of those in me. I want to really take another chance,’ I can understand the allure of doing that as an independent company,” the Xbox head said.\nBungie formally split from Microsoft, with whom it had made multiple Halo games, in 2007. On October 5 of that year, Bungie announced the split and said it had become an independent company. In the division, though, Microsoft retained all rights to Halo, a franchise now developed primarily by 343 Industries.\nNearly three years later, Bungie signed onto a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, with which its popular Destiny franchise would begin. In January of 2019, the studio announced that it had ended this publishing deal early, meaning Bungie was independent once more. It seems that Bungie intends to retain its independence for now. \n[Source: Axios]\nDo you think Bungie would be a good fit for Microsoft today? Let us know in the comments below!",

Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.\nThe End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward.

This week, we're tackling the franchise's most reviled – or misunderstood – entry: Metroid: Other M. \nReleased for the Wii on August 31, 2010, Metroid: Other M saw Nintendo pass the development reins to Team Ninja, the studio most famous for the 3D Ninja Gaiden games. With a new developer came a drastic new vision for the series. A considerable emphasis on narrative gave Samus her first real speaking role (and boy does she talk) and the tale fleshed out her past life with the Galactic Federation.  We'll examine this polarizing narrative along with the development decisions behind Other M's blend of 2D and 3D gameplay.  \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, MinnMax cohort and former GI editor Kyle Hilliard (@KyleMHilliard) as we unpack the history and lore of Metroid: Other M.

The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. \nBloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think this Spartacus service sounds like a true competitor to Xbox Game Pass?

As a survival game, managing Charlie’s nutrition, hydration, and mental health are vital.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAftermath’s foreboding presentation and atmosphere come courtesy of artist Alessandro Bavari, art designer for Alien: Covenant.
