          "description": "Smell of the game.\nSince Guilty Gear first arrived on Sony’s PlayStation in 1998, singeing the air with furious guitar shredding, it’s always been a head turner. While graphically, its goth-rock anime stylings have dazzled with each iteration, Arc System Works’ foremost achievement is in managing to differentiate itself from Capcom’s heavily aped fighting game paradigm. That said, with the series becoming so increasingly convoluted over the last 26 years, ostracising many a would-be player as a result, a redress of sorts was needed. It's here that Guilty Gear Strive steps in.\nStrive remains tonally as it ever was: all-leather and metal; characters that sit somewhere between glam rock and BDSM fetishists; and a blaze of raucous, revved, spectacular battling. Where Guilty Gear XRD (2014) more closely resembled its predecessors, Strive totally overhauls its character models to be larger and more detailed, from muscle ripples to flailing buckles, and introduces new features while removing some others.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And while it’s certainly an incredibly well-realised fantasy world with stunning visuals, atmospheric sound design, and thoughtful combat, it’s unfortunately also held back from greatness by lacklustre level design and excessive backtracking.\nPresenting what may well be a good entry point to the world of Tails of Iron if you happened to miss out on the original, Whiskers of Winter shifts the perspective over to an entirely new protagonist called Arlo, an heir to the Warden of the Wastes who must travel to multiple biomes on a quest to defeat the malicious Dark Wings clan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.\nThere are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.\nI've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them?

Archetype Entertainment.\nSummerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and \"paused operations\" without releasing a single game.

          "description": "Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that \"DEI\" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled \"Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake\". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "\"Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great,\" Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. \"That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

Thus I was lured once again into the roguelike genre, for which I am an eternal sucker.\nDeveloped by Wave Game, Magicraft sees you play as a kid who's isekai'd into another dimension (or at least, I think he is, because I chose the option to \"skip the story\" when I selected new game and only later deduced the situation) and tasked to mince all the demons within it. It's typical fantasy fare with an interesting twist: you can combine any number of spells within your inventory, which made me feel very clever, even if I had no idea what I was doing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.\nRead more",

          "description": "The \"spance\" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Green Hell developer Creepy Jar announced today that its upcoming sci-fi base-builder StarRupture will be released into Early Access in Fall 2025. To celebrate the announcement, Creepy Jar also released an extended gameplay release trailer showcasing the gunplay, building, and exploring players will be able to do this Autumn.\n\n\n\n\nSet in the year 2021, StarRupture puts players into the role of a corporate prisoner exiled to a deceptively vibrant planet ruled by a merciless star, Ruptura. The star inevitably obliterates all surface life in a fiery doom, resulting in cycles of new life and fauna being formed. It's up to you to harvest resources between each cycle to send back to your corpo-overlords while trying to survive the planet's deadly landscape.\n\n\nAs players survive the hostile ecosystem, they'll build a dynamic base and construct sprawling factories to process the planet's precious resources, unlock new tech, and fortify against the swarms of aggressive alien creatures. You can also uncover clues from prior expeditions, explore abandoned camps, discover cryptic logs, and learn more about the deeper narrative of what's really going on here on the surface of this harsh planet.\n\n\nI'm a fan of Green Hell as well as pretty much anything sci-fi, so I'm really interested in seeing what Creepy Jar has cooked up with this one. Based on the trailer, it looks like a nice blend of actual gunplay against the aliens while also building up your base and setting up factories. Usually, games focus too much on one or the other which I think is a missed opportunity. Also, I tend to enjoy co-oping this types of games with a friend or two, so having the option to squad up to 4 players total or jumping in solo is an appealing feature.\n\n\nIf you're interested in trying to survive the fiery wrath of Ruptura, StarRupture ignites into Steam Early Access this Fall via Steam.\n\n\n\nThe post Co-op Sci-Fi base-builder StarRupture blasts into Early Access this Fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

It could potentially be a dish that one of the villagers like Simba or Jack Skellington could request at Chez Remy as well. \n\n\nEggplant Puffs Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo create the tasty Eggplant Puffs for your friends in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need the following three ingredients:\n\n\n\nEggs\n\n\nCheese\n\n\nEggplant\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHonestly, this is one of the easiest dishes to make in the game. Both Eggs and Cheese can be purchased at Chez Remy after completing the rat's quests in the Ratatouille realm in the Castle. Cheese is 220 Star Coins, while Eggs are 180. \n\n\nEggplant seeds are available at Goofy's Stall in the Frosted Heights, which is admittedly quite difficult to reach if you don't have the Dreamlight. You can rack that number up by completing duties and finishing quests from characters along the way. You can also craft Dreamlight by finding Dream Shards in the ground. \n\n\nBack on the topic, however; Eggplant seeds are 95 Star Coins, but if you're lucky (and you don't want to wait), the ingredient itself might be available for 462 Star Coins. \n\n\nWhat is this meal worth?\n\n\nOnce you've gained all the ingredients, go to any cooking station like Chez Remy. Add the Eggs, Cheese, and Eggplant into the pot. You should have the Eggplant Puffs ready to go. They might be the flattest texture you can find in the game, but hey, they can be consumed for 1,941 Energy or sold for 991 Star Coins at Goofy's Stalls.

          "description": "Ubisoft has confirmed that the Japanese version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be censored in some areas to comply with the regional rating organization CERO. The game initially received a \"Z\" rating from CERO, which ensured that it would have been illegal to sell the game to anyone under the age of 18.\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows Japan censorship explained\n\n\nIn a statement translated on X, Ubisoft claims that \"there are some differences in the in-game content of the version sold in Japan in order to comply with the regulations of the reviewing organization,\" referring to CERO. \n\n\n\"The option to switch dismemberment on and off has been removed from the game settings, and now dismembering the heads and limbs of enemies while playing is permanently disabled. The way severed body parts are depicted has also been changed.\" This will be a huge disappointment to players in Japan who were looking forward to this element of the game, although the rest of the world remains unaffected, with the option to toggle dismemberment intact.\n\n\n\n\nThat's not all, though. Interestingly, \"the representation of some Japanese voices played in the overseas versions (North America and Europe) has been changed.\" Ubisoft was light on details regarding this, so it remains to be seen what has specifically changed here. \n\n\nAssassin's Creed Shadows finally takes the long-running series to feudal Japan, arguably one of the most requested periods since the series' inception. On the surface, the two seem to be a match made in heaven, returning back to the RPG formula after the back-to-basics approach of the previous game, Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n\n\nThe road to Shadows has been fraught with controversy, namely multiple delays that have halted the hype somewhat. Still, hands-on previews of Assassin's Creed Shadows have been largely positive, offering hope that Ubisoft may have stuck the landing on this one.\n\nThe post Ubisoft confirms Japan version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to be censored appeared first on Destructoid.",

The series was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, though the digital English version was simultaneously released on MANGA Plus and VIZ Media. With this ending, it joins the long-running titles My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen in the recently concluded list.\n\n\nUndead Unluck first saw the light as a one-shot manga in January 2019, before officially becoming a serialized title a year later. The series quickly gained a strong following for its quirky blend of humor, action, and intriguing premise. With over 200 chapters, the manga was collected into 24 tankobon volumes as of January 2025, with the final chapters yet to be accounted for.\n\n\nThe series also received an anime adaptation in 2023. It was a two-cour season with a total of 24 episodes. The pilot episode aired on October 2023 and the final episode released on March 2024.\n\n\nImage via MANGA Plus\n\n\nWhat is Undead Unluck manga about?\n\n\nThe story follows Fuuko Izumo, a girl whose Unluck curse brings misfortune to anyone she touches. This curse brought her to the lowest of low, causing her to attempt to take her own life. It was during the said attempt that she met Andy, who bore the Undead curse. As the curse's name suggested, Andy couldn't meet his demise no matter what he tried. After centuries of living, he started to search for ways to finally put an end to his life. \n\n\nDespite his years of futile attempts, he finally found a glimmer of home during his fateful meeting with Fuuko. After getting a taste of her Unluck, he realized she was his best chance of achieving his goal. Since Fuuko's curse worsened the stronger her feelings toward her target became, Andy now aimed to make her fall in love with him and bring out the worst Unluck she could possibly manifest.\n\nThe post Undead Unluck manga officially comes to an end appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beginning on February 3 and running until February 17, players will have the opportunity to complete a whole new love-themed quest to earn a rather special emote. \n\n\nDote has long been the go-to emote for those wanting to express their love to special friends in FFXIV, and more recently in 2024, we got the Love Heart emote to go alongside it. Now, another emote, the Bouquet emote, is up for grabs for anyone who completes the Valentione’s Event in 2025.\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nAs a side note, if you missed out on the Love Heart emote and are itching to get your hands on it, the start of this year’s Valentione’s event will also bring the Heart emote to the FFXIV Online Store, so you’ll have a chance to fork out a small amount of real-life money and add it to your ever-growing collection. \n\n\nValentione’s Day 2025 will begin at 3 a.m. EST on February 3, and the emote isn’t the only new thing that will be available. As always, we'll see another unique housing item to be purchased with Gil. This year, this item is the “Heartfelt Valentione’s Day Advertisement”, which features artwork from last year’s event. \n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nAs is standard by this point, Astrid will be waiting at Mih Khetto’s Amphitheatre after the event goes live, and you’ll be able to pick up the event quest “I Promise You A Rose Garden” by talking to her at coordinates (X:10.2, Y:9.4).\n\nThe post Celebrate love with FFXIV Valentione’s Day, coming February 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti.
