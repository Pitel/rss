Movie, and during a chat with Game Informer, the legendary video game creator was asked about the possibility of \"other Nintendo\" series being transformed into movies.\nWhile we're sure many fans out there are already dreaming of adaptations like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid series, there is \"probably nothing to announce in the near future\" even though Nintendo Pictures is now officially a thing. This shouldn't be all that surprising to hear given how long it took Nintendo and Illumination to complete the Mario Movie.

There are thoughts about things that we liked, thoughts about things that we didn't like, and thoughts about all things in between. We managed to get a lot of these down into our review, but a movie of this size was always going to benefit from the ol' conversation treatment too, so that's exactly what we've done.\nIn the above video, Alex and Jim team up to discuss their thoughts on the movie, covering the story, animation, score and that all-important voice cast. While the chat steers clear of any major spoilers, the pair do discuss several plot points, so if you want to go in completely blind, we would say that this is best watched after you have seen the movie — that way, you can join in and see if you agree or disagree with our comments.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "That's no moon!\nItalian-based studio Stormind Games came onto the scene in 2016 alongside the announcement of Remothered: Tormented Fathers, a decent survival horror game that eventually found its way onto the Switch. After its more critically panned sequel dropped two years later, the studio decided to pivot to another genre with a new project, featuring an original IP the company had more control over. This project is Batora: Lost Haven, an isometric action RPG set in an alien world. Batora launched late last year on other platforms and was met with middling reviews; now it’s come to Switch, and we understand why. Batora isn’t a bad game, but it isn’t an especially good one either.\nBatora begins on a post-apocalyptic earth and places you in the role of Avril, a spunky teenager picking through the ruins of London with her best friend, Mila. Suddenly, Avril is whisked away to the alien planet of Gryja by two godlike icons of the sun and moon, who grant her their powers and name her as their champion. Avril is then charged with vanquishing the forces that destroyed Earth (and various other planets), absorbing a bunch of elemental energy from some planetary cores, and restoring balance to the universe. Or something like that.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Featuring the classic Game Boy Advance campaigns from both Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, there's enough turn-based tactical good times here to satiate even the hungriest of wannabe Sun Tzus, and the whole thing has had a right old spruce up in the graphics department.\nWe've been busy getting to grips with the first 13 missions from the Advance Wars campaign and it's been an absolute blast so far. There's been no great shakeup of the core gameplay here — these are genuinely timeless strategy classics we're talking about after all, a pair of almost flawless experiences and the sorts of games that don't really need to be messed with. However, some excellent new modes and a few modern bells and whistles have been introduced, making for an even slicker and more streamlined experience than the one you'll remember from back in ye olden days.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It all fits as a naming convention, right? Well, according to ex-Rare dev Kev Bayliss, the inclusion of the word 'Country' in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES actually has a more significant meaning behind it.\nIn a reply to a question on Twitter as to how the addition of the word 'Country' came to be, Bayliss confirmed that the game had been known as 'The Country Project' during development, owing to the fact that Rare was effectively situated in the middle of the countryside. Bayliss states that Nintendo had simply decided to keep 'Country' in the name, and so Donkey Kong Country was born.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. \r\n\n\r\nBut for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.\nIn Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.\nRead more",

And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?\nA sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.\nI recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.\nRead more",

With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.\nSaying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.\nYou can listen and subscribe via your podcast provider of choice!

I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going \"full pipe\" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. \nBut also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  \n\"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'\" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a \"national treasure\" and \"mandatory reading in high school\" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's \"had to deal with\" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this \"isn't a one-to-one adaptation\" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.\nRead more",

If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you.

I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.\nIt's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.\nRead more",

Let’s get into some good words, shall we?\nWired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.\nHis time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”\n Read more",

I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. \nLuckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.\nRead more",

          "description": "With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he's ever been from home, I recently realised that it'll soon be the longest we've gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.\nI suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?\nRead more",

This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. \r\n\n\r\nWindy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”\r\n \nRead more",

Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.\r\n\n\r\nEncouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.\r\n\n\r\n Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.\nPlaying with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.\nRead more",

Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.\nSo yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.\nRead more",

          "description": "A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.\nSo what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.\nRead more",

There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. \nIt was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website.

But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.\r\n\nBack then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.\nRead more",

It is, like its developer's previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. \r\n\nNow its developer has announced they're doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Po dlouhé době byli strahovští Bastlíři na výjezdu - tentokrát na konferenci Hackaday v Berlíně. Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také \"Badge\" - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.\r\n\r\nAle nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nSamozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

There are four heroes in the base game—I would be shocked if we don’t get one or two more in an expansion pack—each with unique abilities that I can’t wait to see in action. First up for the introduction videos is Layla, the telekinetic hero who can conjur umbrellas, elevators, and her undead boyfriend Jason as she fights against the things that go bump in the night.\nThe video gives a little bit of information on Layla’s background, focusing on the night she and Jason came face to face with a couple of bloodsuckers. Using the telekinetic powers she gained during a laboratory accident, Layla's abilities make her a good candidate for anyone attempting to solo their way through Redfall. In combat, she can manifest protective umbrellas to shield her from attacks, a Lift to reach higher places, and a ghastly version of her old beau for when she's surrounded. A versatile fighter, Layla will likely be the first fighter I go with when I get around to paying the nightmare island town of Redfall a visit.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdLeBCGh1PU\nDeveloped by Arkane Austin, the same team that gave us Prey and Dishonored, Redfall will release on May 2, 2023, for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be available at launch through Xbox Game Pass. Anyone who preorders the game or plays on Game Pass will receive the Vampire Hunting Pack, which includes a shotgun, a weapon skin, and the Blood Ravager Stake Weapon Attachment, which sounds dope as hell.\nThe post Redfall’s Layla gets by with a little help from her (undead) friend appeared first on Destructoid.",

Learn how to add Palafin to your team roster and Miraidon ex to your digital Pokémon TCG collection.\"\n\nThe accompanying news article has a bit more info on how it'll actually be distributed, and a confirmation that it's based on competitive Pokemon player Gavin Michael's Palafin:\n\"Wait for the password to appear during the 2023 EUIC broadcast, then go to the Mystery Gift feature in your game and enter the password to receive Gavin Michaels' Palafin—you can even add it to your next competitive team! This password can only be used once per save data.\"\n\nSo that's it! Wait for the code to arrive and enter it. Seems easy enough! We'll update you when that time comes.

          "description": "The VP seems to have left following Stadia's downturn\nPhil Harrison, the former head of Stadia at Google, has reportedly left the company.\nA new report from Business Insider said that Harrison left Google around the time when it shut down the Stadia streaming service. Though no official statement's been made as of this writing, Harrison's LinkedIn does reflect the change, with his departure from Google marked at April 2023.\nHarrison has been around the games industry for quite a while, working at both Sony and Microsoft over the years. He joined Google in 2018, taking the lead on the company's efforts to start up the cloud streaming service Stadia. Harrison even took the stage at GDC 2019 to unveil this vision for a streaming future.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUih5C5rOrA\nOf course, we all remember how Stadia turned out. In 2021, Google shut down its internal development projects for Stadia, saying it would not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from its internal development team. At the time, Harrison cited the \"exponentially\" rising costs of creating \"best-in-class games from the ground up.\"\nThen, a year later, Google officially closed the curtain on Stadia. All hardware purchases made through the Google Store would be refunded, and in January of this year, the service officially shuttered. Harrison wrote in a blog post that the technology hadn't \"gained the traction with users\" that Google expected.\nThe clouds set\nThere's been no formal announcement, and no indication of what may be next for Harrison. As for Stadia, well, that's just about through.\nGoogle recently told Axios in an interview that it's been selling a bundle of services to publishers, moving into the role of tech partner for live-service publishers.\nThe post Former Stadia head Phil Harrison has reportedly left Google appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the term \"kusoge\" has a certain degree of affection behind it, sort of like “Eurojank.” The game may be poorly made, it might be excruciating to play, but there’s something that makes it worthwhile.

Bandai Namco is working on a new story DLC for One Piece Odyssey called Reunion of Memories, and it's coming soon.\nThere's no indication of a date just yet, but today's teaser trailer lays out some of the narrative groundwork. Much like the story of One Piece Odyssey itself, Reunion of Memories looks to be diving back into the storied past of the manga series. Lim, the young woman from Waford who played a key role in Odyssey, looks to be the focal point again, as the team is contending with a Dark Lim doppelganger.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LpM5Yc9-Io\nIn a message from the game's producer, Katsuaki Tsuzuki, it's said that one of the key points of this One Piece Odyssey DLC is the theme of \"new hidden story with bonds.\" It will also focus heavily on battles, and the team recommends clearing the main story before tackling the DLC.\nThere will also be some new characters that weren't in the main game. The full roster isn't being confirmed yet, but Tsuzuki says you may be surprised to find other characters \"where you least expect them.\" More details are on the way soon.\nAdditionally, since release, the team has been listening to feedback and player requests, some of which have already been implemented in patches since launch.\nThe quest never ends\nOne Piece is still one of those series that I'm aware of but have never really personally dug into. That said, Odyssey seems like it was an interesting exploration of the fiction, if nothing else. I certainly respect the effort to try and tell the tale in an RPG format.\nFor those hoping for deeper One Piece cuts in their Odyssey, I hope they get what they want when the Reunion of Memories DLC hits.\nThe post One Piece Odyssey is getting some story DLC in Reunion of Memories appeared first on Destructoid.",

Frankly, he needs his own game (but I'll have to settle for his own mode for now). However you feel about him, you can enjoy one of Kirby's greatest frenemies on a canvas bag as a My Nintendo US reward.\nHere's the full description of the bag from Nintendo:\n\"This sturdy canvas pouch has a zipper closure, so it’s the perfect place to store treasured items. Featuring the powerful pink puff Kirby and the mysterious cosmic traveler Magolor.\"\n\nSo it's a bag.\nIt's 500 Platinum Points (which is on the median/low end for many rewards), so if you want it, get it! Although rewards generally stay up for a decent amount of time and occasionally come back in stock, nothing is guaranteed on My Nintendo: especially with supply chain woes continually rearing up.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "Wizard needs food badly\nCrackshell has been showing off snippets of their upcoming Hammerwatch II for a few years now, but today it has been fully revealed. Modus Entertainment has announced that Hammerwatch II will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch this summer.\n2013’s Hammerwatch and its spinoff, 2018’s Heroes of Hammerwatch, are something of fixtures in the indie hack-and-slash space. They’re notable for their strong co-op elements. Hammerwatch II is boasting much of the same action, but including a day/night cycle and an “entirely new” mapmaker. The press release for this also touts “smarter enemy AI,” which sounds kind of weird for a Gauntlet-like.\nhttps://youtu.be/levsLa-NLWI\nThe trailer dropped alongside the announcement shows off the good stuff: ghost wolves! Also, dragons and dungeons.\nThe release also says that a special edition of Hammerwatch II will be available at retail stores and digitally at launch. Titled Hammerwatch II: The Chronicles Edition, this will run you $40 American dollars and include “the original remastered Hammerwatch,” as well as character color palettes, “facial items,” and a voice pack. I have no idea if this is a new remaster of Hammerwatch and what that entails, or if it's just a re-release.\nI never played Hammerwatch, but Steam thinks I really should since it features heavily on the store for me. It looks cool, but having one friend is exhausting for me. I can’t imagine what it would be like to have three friends.\nHammerwatch II will be dropping on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch sometime this summer.\nThe post Hammerwatch II bangs out new trailer and release window appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You'll also get an \"update bonus\"\nFire Emblem Engage is still trucking with updates and DLC (via the expansion pass system), and we're at the end of the line with this first (and potentially only) pass today, through the game's 2.0 update. Let's quickly break down the biggest aspects of Fire Emblem Engage 2.0.\nThe big thing is that Wave 4 of the expansion pass is now live. Titled Fell Xenologue, it includes new characters, maps, locations, and class types as a micro-expansion of sorts. This is on top of the prior three waves which really were micro-DLC, with smaller skirmishes and the ability to recruit spirits. 2.0 also adds more \"update bonuses,\" which can be acquired upon entering the Somniel: the game's core hub.\nThe other tidbit (which is going to be either useless or a cool perk depending on how much you engage with Nintendo's mobile side) includes a \"collaboration\" with Fire Emblem Heroes, which basically involves bonus items. Bug fixes have also been deployed in a typically vague fashion.\nThere's nothing too exciting on offer here unless you're diving into Fell Xenologue. You can check out the full patch notes for Fire Emblem Engage 2.0 below.\nFire Emblem Engage 2.0 patch notes (full link)\nVer. 2.0.0 (Released April 4, 2023)\nGeneral Updates\nCompatible with Wave 4 of the Expansion Pass.\nUpdate Bonus has been added. You can receive items when entering the Somniel from Chapter 5 or later.\nCollaboration content with the smartphone app “Fire Emblem Heroes” can now be downloaded for free from the Nintendo eShop.\n\nYou can receive items when entering the Somniel after downloading the data from the eShop.\nNote that players who have already downloaded the bonuses from linking with “Fire Emblem Heroes” cannot download the content again.\nIssues have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.\nThe post Fire Emblem Engage 2.0 brings the big story expansion with it appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following a postponement in 2020, (amidst the burgeoning COVID-19 pandemic), the pop-up store eventually returned in the summer of 2022, running alongside the Pokemon World Championships.\n\nIf you fancy making the trip to next week's opening, then you'll need to book yourself a timeslot over on the store's official website. This virtual queuing system hopes to eliminate the chaos of the 2019 event, though it should still be noted that merchandise will likely be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, with the more exclusive items selling out in double-quick time. You can just turn up on the store's opening days without warning, but you might find that you have to hang around for a little while before giving appropriate entry.\nThe Pokemon Center London is located at ExCeL London arena, and will be open from April 14 to April 16.\nThe post The Pokemon Center pop-up store returns to London ExCel next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Additionally, the new update includes fixes for the game's UI, and tackles some of the strange behavior exhibited by NPCs out on the mean streets of Boston. Players with nVidia Series 30 graphics cards are advised to update their drivers before playing with the new patch installed.\n\"We at Naughty Dog and our partners at Iron Galaxy are closely watching player reports to support future improvements and patches.\" writes ND on the official patch notes. \"We are actively optimizing, working on game stability, and implementing additional fixes which will all be included in regularly released future updates.\"\nThe Last of Us Part I launched on Steam on March 28. And, despite being delayed by almost a month, has disappointed fans with a litany of issues, ranging from visual glitches and broken textures, to clipping animation, effect botches, long load times, and random crashing. The Steam releases holds a \"Mostly Negative\" review rating on the Steam platform, a disappointment given Naughty Dog's excellent PC port of previous release such as Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.\nThe post The Last of Us Part I PC woes prioritized over Steam Deck Verification appeared first on Destructoid.",

The next Crusader Kings III expansion, dubbed Tours and Tournaments, debuts on May 11, 2023.\nWhile Crusader Kings has had plenty of courtroom drama, this particular expansion looks to add some pageantry to all of it. Host a royal wedding! It's never gone poorly for anyone, ever. Head out on tour, or yes, even hold your own tournament. I'm sure leaving your kingdom in the hands of a cunning and ambitious seat-warmer will certainly turn out fine.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATwJhpy_FQw\nIt's not all just events planning, though. The new travel system will include route planning, which means determining how fast you want to travel versus how safe your charted course will be.\nAdditionally, Knightly Accolades are getting a spotlight, as are some new armor designs and clothing. Fashion is crucial, even at a sometimes bloody tournament.\nExpanding your borders\nThe Tours and Tournaments expansion for Crusader Kings III will go for $29.99, and will launch alongside a \"major\" free update for all CKIII players. Or, if you prefer a more deluxe route, you can also pick up the Chapter II pack.\nThe Chapter Packs for Crusader Kings III tie in a few extra updates, big and small, for $34.99. Picking that up now will immediately garner the Elegance of the Empire Pack, with historic regalia inspired by real-life rulers. Further on down the road, alongside Tours and Tournaments, Chapter II pack-owners will get the Wards and Wardens Pack as well as the Legacy of Persia pack.\nBasically, a lot more grand strategy is on the way for a pretty solid grand strategy game, from what I've heard. Tours and Tournaments arrive for Crusader Kings III on May 11.\nThe post Crusader Kings III’s next expansion tackles Tours and Tournaments in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

But with Moushley, a social media post has spurred on a legion of fan art and, finally, a special mod for putting Moushley in Resident Evil 4.\nIf you're unfamiliar, Moushley all seems to have started with a Twitter post from user @Agrimmora, imagining the president's daughter Ashley Graham as a tiny mouse. The adorable take on Ashley encouraged many more adaptations and versions. Moushley is having a moment, I'd say.\nWell, a new mod now takes the Moushley idea and gives it the Pixar treatment. Cathroon's \"Moushley Graham - Ratatouille Mod\" asks the question, \"What if Moushley was Ratatouille-ing Leon?\" The results are simply stupendous.\nhttps://twitter.com/cathroon/status/1643119048945958915\nThe Moushley model comes from TheCapsuleFiend, and uses it as a hair replacement option for Leon Kennedy. With it, Moushley can ride atop Leon's head, directing him through all the horrors of Resident Evil 4. It's headcanon, but valid.\nYou'll need the Fluffy Mods Manager and ensure that the hair strands option is turned off in the settings, but otherwise, it should be a squeaky clean install from the Nexus mods page.\nA cheesy addition\nWhile there have been plenty of wild and weird mods for Resident Evil 4, I really do like the Moushley addition. For one, it's reflective of a fun fan reimagining, and is relatively wholesome.\nIt's also just a neat little addition for addition's sake. It's not a new gameplay feature, or cheat code. (Though you do have to play safer, for Moushley's sake.) It's just a neat little touch for those who enjoy the idea of special agent Leon Kennedy being secretly controlled by a sweater-wearing mouse.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 mod puts a tiny Moushley on top of Leon’s head appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Xbox Wireless Controller Remix Special Edition is a new version of the Xbox controller, partially made with reclaimed materials.\nThe Xbox Wire blog goes into deeper detail, but each Remix controller will have recovered plastics, specifically one-third of it made from regrind and reclaimed materials. This means that each Remix should have its own little touches of swirls and markings, to make yours very special.\nNotably, this means that these Remix controllers are made up of, among other things, reground controllers. As Microsoft describes it, there are mechanically recycled leftover Xbox One generation controller parts ground back into raw material in there, which has been used as a component for the new controllers. The circle of Xbox life.\nThe Remix controller also comes with a special feature: the Xbox Rechargeable Battery Pack. This lets you dispose of those disposable batteries, and either charge while you play or afterwards, with up to 30 hours of battery life per charge according to Xbox. I have fond memories of these little packs from the 360 era.\nThe Remix to emissions\nThe Remix Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller will go live on April 18, with an $84.99 price tag. It also comes with a textured grip, hybrid D-pad, button mapping, and Bluetooth built-in.\nXbox is also highlighting other sustainability efforts its making, and Microsoft Rewards members will be able to earn and donate points to support environmental organizations throughout April.

It’s a colony builder set in the middle of the ocean, where you get your humble beginnings through gathering driftwood and eventually build up to a full micronation. You farm, craft, and invent to build up your oceanic paradise.\nhttps://youtu.be/I_Kj4I71mu8\nThe sole developer, Yeo Ying Zhi (YYZ), has shown a commitment to including the community surrounding Havendock in its development. “I wish I could procrastinate everything, but I don't want to disappoint the people out there waiting for Havendock. It's a great motivation, though, now I actually need to set an alarm to go to sleep,” they said in a press release.\nI appreciate that the trailer gets right into the action. The animation and character interactions are a little rough looking, but why hide that? It’s a solo-dev effort, and more games are just starting to own that title.\nYYZ is planning on having Havendock in Early Access for the rest of the year. For its early launch, a lot of the building is already there, but the story still needs fleshing out, and the goal is to incorporate a lot of community feedback.

And while Ghostwire: Tokyo was a timed exclusive even after the purchase of Bethesda by Xbox, it's now coming  to those consoles and hitting Game Pass.\nStill, there are plenty of surprises and little gems in Game Pass this month too. Loop Hero is a great pick-up, and one I'd strongly recommend you check out if you haven't yet; it mixes concepts of auto-battling, idle games, city building, and more to make a very strange and interesting kind of RPG adventure.\nThere's also NHL 23 hitting on April 13 via EA Play, for all the Chel fans out there. Lastly, Iron Brigade arrives, a bit of an oddity in the development history of Double Fine. Still, if you've been watching the Double Fine Psychodyssey and wanted to dive deeper into the studio's catalog, Iron Brigade is an interesting part of it.\nHere's the full lineup for this month's initial batch of games, as well as the games that are leaving soon on April 15.\nXbox Game Pass April 2023 arrivals\nLoop Hero (Console, PC) - Out today\nIron Brigade (Cloud, console) - April 6\nGhostwire: Tokyo (Cloud, console, PC) - April 12\nNHL 23 (Console via EA Play) - April 13\nMinecraft Legends (Cloud, console, PC) - April 18\nLeaving Xbox Game Pass on April 15\nLife is Strange: True Colors (Cloud, console, PC)\nMoonglow Bay (Cloud, console, PC)\nPanzer Corps II (PC)\nRainbow Six Extraction (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe Dungeon of Naheulbeuk (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe Long Dark (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe Riftbreaker (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe post Xbox Game Pass gets blocks, hockey, and a little bit loopy in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

Our anti-hero will seek such justice armed with little more than a mean attitude and an incredibly versatile rifle, which also doubles as a shield, a zipline, a floatation device and, of course, an umbrella.\nGunbrella is currently in development for PC and Nintendo Switch, and is tentatively scheduled to launch later in 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1642950096353648640?s=20\nThe post Devolver acquires Gunbrella developer Doinksoft appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you’re eggs-pecting me to make egg puns throughout this article, I’m going to have to disappoint you. The egg is the cradle of life, and I cannot eggs-press the level of respect that demands.\nNow, if I can have your attention, I would like you to eggs-amine this game.\nhttps://youtu.be/Be0P8Ct6-28\nNope. I can’t go on like that. It’s horrible, and I can feel the shame starting to knot up in my chest. So let’s forget this ever happened. It's eggs-cruciating.\nYolked reminds me of Heave Ho or Endoparasitic. You play as an arm-having egg, and guide them across various environments and obstacles using the kind of grip that makes bass musicians jealous. You can also collect costumes for your eggs. That mostly sums it up, but the trailer demonstrates a lot of interesting situations, including some so bizarre that I want to see how they fit into the game.\nAs a writer in video game media, I sometimes get to abuse my platform. This is one such time. I don’t really have any time to play Yolked for review, so instead, I’m highlighting its impending launch as a way to try and get more people to play it, so I can live vicariously through them.\nYolked - The Egg Game is available on Steam Early Access right now, but you can eggs-pect the full version to drop April 6, 2023.\nThe post Yolked cracks out of Early Access April 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

There is nothing left to do but rebuild. And it's in restoring nature, in unpacking the very idea of a city-builder, that Terra Nil finds a smart twist on a traditional foundation.\nIt's fun to think that the same team behind Broforce and Genital Jousting made Terra Nil. It's not that I don't think a studio that's made games about bros and dicks can't also make a game about ecological restoration. But Terra Nil sees Free Live exploring an incredibly serene approach to puzzles and city-building.

Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.\nDozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below. \n\n\nIf you enjoy this video, please subscribe to the Game Informer YouTube channel. This video feature is part of our indie-focused magazine issue, which Sea of Stars headlines. Visit our online cover story hub to learn how Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda came to work on Sea of Stars or watch our latest documentary in which we explore caves with the creator of Spelunky. \nDon't let my byline fool you – Game Informer staffers Kyle Hilliard and Charles Harte worked hard to produce this video feature.

          "description": "Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.\nNew Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.\nSeveral new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.\nNew Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.\nAmong several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.\nIt’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.\nGod of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\nYou can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.",

While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles.

The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.\nThe same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding.

If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. \nPGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

Now today, less than a month later, Deck 13 has announced that the game has been delayed to August. \nMore specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game. \nHey people, we have some important news! pic.twitter.com/W2YKNk3xfU\nMarch 29, 2023\nDeck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen. \nFor more about Atlas Fallen, check out this trailer from last year. \nAre you excited for Atlas Fallen?

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.\n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft skipping E3? Do you expect the event to still take place?

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
