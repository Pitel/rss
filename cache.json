It’s questions like this that have driven humankind to explore the planet, the cosmos, and ourselves. And the kitchen. This irresistible drive of curiosity and the addictive high of discovery are what Outer Wilds captures so well, letting this indie game put big-name space exploration titles to shame.\nMobius Digital’s mesmerising cosmic adventure that is Outer Wilds first landed on PC and Xbox in 2019 to serious critical acclaim. Receiving plaudits around the internet and a Best Game BAFTA to boot, it’s no surprise that it topped stacks of game-of-the-year lists. It’s been a long wait for Switch gamers hoping for a port, but it’s mostly good news: the indie masterpiece has kept its magic in the jump to Nintendo’s portable – albeit with a bit of a technical struggle. The Echoes of the Eye DLC has also found its way over as part of the Archaeologist’s Edition, although we received the base game for review.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Enjoy!\n\nThe little blue guy known as Mega Man (along with his various associates and related robots) has had a very long and storied career in video games. Since the NES days, he's starred in some absolute classics of the run-and-gun genre, although for every incredible game or spin-off experience Capcom has delivered, there have arguably been one or two titles that either didn't quite hit the mark or — more often — felt a little too familiar. With so many games in the Blue Bomber's back catalogue, it can be hard to know which ones are the cream of the crop. Well, that's where we come in.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With time, patience, and persistence, it is relatively easy to learn the ropes and get through each entry with little fuss, but if there’s one thing the original franchise lacked — particularly on the NES — it was a tutorial.

It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. \nOnce you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller. \nRead more",

Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as \"boomer shooters\" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.\nI reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.\nRead more",

You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? \"No.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "\"I was looking up our Wikipedia page to see what happened this year,\" says Nightdive Studios' CEO Stephen Kick as we sit down to chat. That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company's activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it's less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. \r\n\n\r\nIn short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio's future.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I appreciate that a PC gaming site might not be the most natural home for this information, considering both that these are not technically gaming CPUs and that that Meteor Lake’s most hyped-up feature is more of a productivity aid: a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for client-side AI work.

          "description": "Video game openings have always been a source of fascination for me. As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? \nIn revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.\nRead more",

As a child, my family didn't have much money and I didn't get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, \"You've not played insert game before?\" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?\nFor me, approaching Doom was cathartic. Playing a game that's older than myself was certainly an experience, but I was shocked at how well it holds up. \nRead more",

It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.\nBut I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.\nNow, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.\nRead more",

          "description": "A good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption. Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. \r\n\n\r\nIn the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is \"nope\" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up. \r\n \nRead more",

This book contains scenes of graphic violence!\" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. \"Knee-deep in the dead!\" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.\nThe cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve \"Body Bag\" Behling and Michael \"Splatter\" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: \"Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'\"\nRead more",

I think that the popularity of \"looting\", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.\nI distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.\nRead more",

          "description": "Two years ago, developers Fntastic debuted their \"open world survival MMO\" The Day Before with a fairly lengthy trailer (which has since been scrubbed from their official YouTube channel, but it's been preserved by IGN and Gamespot). It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.\nNow, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.\nRead more",

Cured, judging from Rivals’ more palatable monetisation plans, of the myxomatosis that killed it in the first place.\r\n\n\r\nFrom what I played, Tribes 3 can definitely bring back happy memories of zipping around, nicking flags and copping Spinfuser blasts, and the finished article may well have the chops to create some new ones. At the same time, the playtest build was conspicuously short on much of what makes Tribes really feel like Tribes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Well, it would be if Doomguy ever lowered the drawbridge to his flying space castle high above the Earth's orbit. I did try and get a radio signal out earlier, but the grumpy sod never responded. Probably too busy organising his trophy case in his man cave, to be honest. But let's face it. Doomguy wouldn't be much fun at a birthday party anyway. He'd be too busy ripping and tearing into his presents to give anyone the time of day, let alone a polite thank you, and then he'd be working on ripping and tearing apart said presents in a display of strength and machismo. \nSo Doom's hellspawn have got together to throw their own party for the occasion, and let me tell you, they're having a riotous good time all by themselves. Well, most of them are, anyway, as there are some demons here that wouldn't know how to have fun even if was seared across their skulls with the beam of a BFG9000.

It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.\nA spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her \"Ascend\" to the afterlife.\nRead more",

          "description": "In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. \nAt the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date. \nRead more",

There are many reasons to commemorate id Software's 1993 jaunt through the demon-infested corridors of Mars, from the fact that you can play it on every device known to man to its undying modding scene that even lets you pet Cacodemons. But I have a personal connection with Doom that's a bit special. It's the first game that made me so sick I wanted to puke.\nRead more",

          "description": "A year or two ago I interviewed an actual, practising witch, the wonderful Damien Crawford of Purgatory Dungeoneer fame, about how videogames represent magic. I badly need Crawford's thoughts on Emberstorm Entertainment's Reka, published by Fireshine Games, which has just been slapped with a Steam early access release window of Q2 2024.\nIn this curious, moody survival-ish adventure, you're an apprentice witch who travels about the land in a chicken-legged cottage loaned out by your mentor, the Baba Jaga. The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0. Here's the latest trailer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "“When people read anything, no matter the source, they will believe it.” So says Doom designer John Romero on the subject of his relationship with John Carmack. Together, the pair built id Software and the FPS genre as we know it - before the cracks started to show during the difficult development of Quake, ending their professional partnership.\nYet any lasting acrimony has now dissipated. That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”\nRead more",

After a too-soon dabble in early access, I was already intrigued by its setting. You'll never guess.\nIt's a welcome change from dusty radiation or goddamn elves again, and the RPG structure feels flexible and fairly responsive to your actions even before you start picking sides and ideologies. It hasn't quite stolen my heart, but it may well steal some of my christmas.\nRead more",

I have, and this year, despite not having had to stay up until 5am covering it, I'm grumpy enough to point out that we don't actually have to be nice about the great, clomping shiny trainer of marketing in 2023, the year everyone was laid off.\nRead more",

          "description": "Tým belgických výzkumníků publikoval článek o nové implementaci SSH přes protokol HTTP/3. V článku nazvaném Towards SSH3: how HTTP/3 improves secure shells se píše: Protokol SSH byl navržen na konci devadesátých let, aby se vypořádal s bezpečnostními problémy rodiny protokolů telnet. Do protokolů pro vzdálený přístup přinesl ověřování a důvěrnost a nyní je široce používán. Téměř 30 let po původním návrhu se k protokolu SSH vracíme ve světle nejnovějších protokolů včetně QUIC, TLS 1.3 a HTTP/3. Navrhujeme, implementujeme a vyhodnocujeme protokol SSH3, který poskytuje rozšířenou sadu funkcí bez kompromisů ve srovnání s protokolem SSHv2.",

The unexpected arrival of Xenos ships and the quick deployment of their star-shattering weapon left my crew in complete disarray. As I met with a round table of companions and ship staff, I was presented with choices.\n\n\nWith the collapsing force of the star and the growing instability brought on by the Warp, evacuations were ill-advised. Still, I could try to save the nearby planet's population, but allies noted that the Warp had likely corrupted them. Alternatively, a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus asked if I'd consider diverting resources to save a piece of sacred machinery. Others at the meeting demanded we high-tail it out of the system as fast as possible.\n\n\nI made what I though…",

Gaming's the new kid on the block, and it seems pathologically obsessed with clinging onto Hollywoodesque tropes and presentation styles. Nevertheless, with its flourishing popularity, the gaming industry does occasionally show deep-seated desires to forge an independent identity.\n\n\n\nFMV games complicate the situation further. They're not quite movies, as you're invited to interact with the story. On the other hand, when you have live-action scenes in your game, it's understandable to feel like you're engaging with the work of folks who'd much rather be on film sets. \n\n\n\n\nStubbornly resistant to concrete categories, FMVs exist in a liminal space populated with both potential and pitfalls.

          "description": "In sad news for anyone who enjoys fan games and remakes of retro titles, Nintendo has shut down a fan-made The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening PC port. \n\n\nEurogamer reported on this disappointing turn of events for the Zelda fangame community, and reiterating its features only makes its loss sting. The Link's Awakening PC port included some lovely features, including supporting up to 120 frames per second, widescreen, and zooming options that could let you see virtually the entire world map at once. That still doesn't change how ardently protective Nintendo is over its properties, so it called for the game be pulled from Itch's pages.\n\n\nAccording to the Nintendo representative who sent the notice of infringement, \"It has come to our attention that the following game, https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd, offered on Itch.io infringes and makes unauthorized use of Nintendo’s copyrights in The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening video game.\"\n\n\nAny downloads for the Link's Awakening port are no longer available on its Itch.io page. Its takedown is a shame, but not a surprise.\n\n\n\n\nNintendo is infamous for its ironclad control over its IPs, with well-documented fights with other fan projects. There are plenty of cases in the past of projects like this gradually picking up internet infamy, then receiving a cease-and-desist.\n\n\nWhile Nintendo's within its legal rights to go after these projects, it's sad to see interesting projects like these go. Link's Awakening is still available on Switch, either through the remake or Switch Online's Game Boy collection.\n\nThe post Fan-made Link’s Awakening PC port has been taken down by Nintendo appeared first on Destructoid.",

Upfront, it's a big meaty game. So I think that should be able to exist as it is. This is what allows us to continue making other games.\"\n\n\nWith the average Baldur's Gate 3 playthrough running for at least 50 hours (according to player data aggregated by HowLongToBeat) Vincke definitely has a point there. My own run took me 107 hours, and I  ignored a whole bunch of side quests and points of interest in Act 3.\n\n\nLarian doesn't seem inclined to give up Xbox's market potential for a Game Pass deal with Microsoft, and given the game's overwhelming success, it's no wonder.\n\n\n\n\nStill, Xbox fans might find it disappointing that the studio is dismissing the possibility altogether. Vincke, who recently released his full Game of the Year acceptance speech, certainly isn't mincing words when he talks about knowing what their game is really worth. \n\n\nWhile Baldur's Gate 3 took home multiple trophies at The Game Awards and has received a lot of acclaim, it's easy to see how some might still be wary of spending $70 if they're not not an initiate of the CRPG genre or Dungeons & Dragons itself. \n\n\nA Game Pass demo might have gone a long way toward alleviating those fears.

It seems evident that we should never forget the classics. And that's exactly what this one modder is doing with the original RE2.\n\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to blend modern Resident Evil with the retro installments, Itch.io user PerroAutonomo has been remaking the second game in the series. Only, they aren't updating the visuals or the cheesy dialogue. No. They're sticking with how the original 1998 release looked, but have made it into a first-person shooter.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil does a half hour playthrough of the demo. As for when the full thing will be released, PerroAutonomo's page says they may not finish it, and the current build \"has many errors\" (translated by Google).\n\n\nComplete with fully remade cut scenes\n\n\nThe footage shows how authentic this unofficial remake is. It endeavors to keep the visual style of Resident Evil 2 but chooses a different perspective. We get to see a lot of the game from new angles never seen before, and even though it's a fan project, it's still impressive to see.\n\n\nAs Capcom marches forward with its iconic survival horror series, we welcome whatever's on the horizon. With more Resident Evil remakes being confirmed, everyone's going to be wondering which one's going to get the remake treatment next.\n\n\nWe may well get to see a fresh take on one of the spin-offs, such as Code Veronica or Umbrella Chronicles. Or maybe RE5 will get another crack at not being a disappointment. Time will tell on that front. \n\nThe post This Resident Evil 2 fan remake turns the classic into an FPS appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Via Twitter, Square Enix has announced that the latest in the SaGa series, SaGa: Emerald Beyond, will launch on April 25, 2024. It’s coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.\n\n\nWhile a new SaGa entry was talked about as far back as 2021, SaGa: Emerald Beyond was only officially announced in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. It’s the latest from the long-running series, dating back to 1989 with Makai Toushi SaGa or The Final Fantasy Legend. You don’t have to have been following the series since then, as this one is supposedly standalone.\n\n\n\n\nSaGa: Emerald Beyond is an RPG where you take control of six protagonists and explore 17 interconnected worlds. It features a branching storyline based on the choices you make. The combat is turn-based, with a great deal of emphasis put on the timeline, which tracks turn order. From the look of it, it’s similar to Fuga: Melodies of Steel, where your success is determined partially by how you can maximize your speed while delaying the enemy.\n\n\nI’ve never gotten into the SaGa series, mainly because I don’t really know where to start. I’ve played The Final Fantasy Legend, but dropped off partway through. I’m not sure sequentially is the right move here. However, SaGa: Emerald Beyond looks rad as heck, with some great character design and imaginative worlds.\n\n\nSaGa: Emerald Beyond releases on April 25, 2024 on Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.\n\nThe post Square Enix announces that SaGa: Emerald Beyond will release April 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Other outlets such as GOG also put some deals on as well, and the CD Projekt-owned distribution site has recently started its winter sale.\n\n\nIf you head over to Good Old Games, you'll see a host of titles that are currently on offer. The event is going until January 4, so you've got some time to get a few downloads in around the Christmas period.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what's on offer, there's a veritable bevy of classic/retro and more modern releases. For example, the original Mortal Kombat games are currently 75% off, as is the complete Yakuza series. The remake of System Shock is 35% off and, naturally, Cyberpunk 2077 and the DLC are discounted at 50% and 15% respectively.\n\n\nYes, of course Skyrim is in the sale, too\n\n\nAll-in-all, there are around 6,000 games that are part of the winter sales event. Oh, I could list off many more examples, but I'd be here for quite some time.\n\n\nSuffice it to see, there's quite a few that I'll be tempted to pick up between now and January. I was pleasantly surprised to see the Myst 30th anniversary collection at nearly 60% off. Not because I'm a fan of Myst (have never played it), but because I don't think I even knew it was that old. Time is fleeting, etc.\n\n\nAnyway, as we approach the end of 2023, all the gaming platforms and websites will be putting on their own sales. Look out for the Steam winter event next week. Admit it. That's probably what most of you are waiting for.\n\nThe post The GOG winter sale is in full swing appeared first on Destructoid.",

For those looking to boost their ranking on Santa's Nice List, PowerWash Simulator is taking us to Santa's Workshop to clean up after a wild elf party.\n\n\nIn an X post made by the PowerWash Simulator account, a gift has arrived for those who wish to clean a bit more. Players on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam can access a new free level on December 14, 2023, and Switch players can get in on the fun on January 8, 2024.\n\n\nPowerWash Simulator brings Santa's Workshop to life\n\n\nThe level itself is a small but densely packed affair, with plenty of nooks and crannies to blast clean. I hadn't touched PowerWash Simulator since the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC back in June and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it all came back to me. Before I knew it, Christmas had been saved and my trip to the North Pole could be written off as a business expense.\n\n\nEvery one of PowerWash Simulator's offerings, both free and paid, has been an utter delight. Santa's Workshop is no different and offers plenty of reasons to boot up the relaxing title and spray away the gunk.\n\n\n\n\nWith the Warhammer 40,000 DLC being delayed to 2024, this bite-sized DLC should hopefully be enough to tide players over. Either way, if you've been wanting a break from other titles or even want to take power washing into the third dimension, PowerWash Simulator has you covered. Just make sure you wear the proper PPE when cleaning Cloud's Buster Sword in the Seventh Heaven Bar.\n\nThe post Get on Santa’s Nice List with the PowerWash Simulator Santa’s Workshop update appeared first on Destructoid.",

The publisher announced plans to bring both The Legend of Steel Empire and Over Horizon to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in early 2024.\n\n\nThe Switch version of The Legend of Steel Empire will touch down first on Switch in January, then PS4 at a later date. Following the 1992 Sega Mega Drive and 2004 Game Boy Advance Steel Empire games by HOT-B, this one is an HD remaster based on the PC version with some additional features. These include reworked controls, high-definition visuals, and a leveling system that boosts both your strength and the resilience of your enemies depending on how many items you collect.\n\n\nAlso included in the physical Steel Empire Chronicles from Strictly Limited, The Legend of Steel Empire will be available physically and digitally on Switch. Here's a trailer: \n\n\n\n\nOver Horizon is a spiritual successor of sorts, with development from HOT-B and the co-director of Steel Empire. This entry wasn't released outside of Japanese and PAL territories, so fans of the series around the world will soon be able to check it out on Switch and PS4. Over Horizon is currently penciled in for sometime in early 2024 for both platforms. \n\n\nIf you're looking for the most comprehensive collection, that Strictly Limited release still has a handful of LE Switch versions in stock. It includes the Steel Empire HD remaster, as well as the Mega Drive and Game Boy Advance versions, and the NES version of Over Horizon. You won't find the 3DS version there, though, so you'll have to stick to the second dimension. \n\nThe post Two Steel Empire shmups head to Switch and PS4 in early 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Embracer Group acquired 3D Realms in 2021.\n\n\nWhen will it end?\n\n\nThis continues the almost weekly trend of Embracer Group enacting layoffs, with over 900 employees losing their jobs just this year at the hands of Embracer. According to an interim report by Embracer, the layoffs are due to a reduced number of projects across the board. All while posting a 13% increase in net sales this year.\n\n\nOf course, Embracer Group is just a piece of the story. According to VideoGameLayoffs.com which tracks layoffs across the industry, over 9000 jobs have been lost this year.

Mouse is an upcoming FPS that styles itself off these retro cartoons, and developer Fumi Games has just released a gameplay trailer for it.\n\n\nTaking direct inspiration from the animated shows and noir films of a bygone era, Mouse combines high-octane first-person shooting with the goofy antics of these ancient toons. From what can be seen in the trailer, it looks like there's even some blood for that added sense of mindless violence. You can wishlist the game right now.\n\n\n\n\nThe studio describes Mouse thus:\n\n\n\nWith guns blazing and a retro rubber hose animation style, battle your way through a corrupt city full of crooks and danger.\n\n\n\n\nIt's like Mickey Mouse meets Edward G Robinson\n\n\nAt the moment, there's no exact release date, but Fumi is aiming to launch in 2025. While the trailer says it's \"early gameplay footage,\" it's looking pretty good so far. A post on Steam says the team is \"aiming to make sure to have the best game possible!\"\n\n\nThere aren't many video games like this. The most obvious example that comes to mind is Cuphead, which goes for that rubbery style of animation, but in a more fun – albeit brutally challenging – context. Then there's Bendy and the Ink Machine, which leans way more into the horror aspects, but clearly takes inspiration from this era of cartoons.\n\n\nIt's nice that we live in a time when 1930s cartoons can be reborn as gritty shooters. There's a kind of fast-paced action to Mouse that seems like what Steamboat Willie would be like, if it was remade by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThe post Mouse is an upcoming FPS heavily inspired by old-school Disney cartoons appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now he's taken a second pass online, and delivered a moving statement on behalf of everyone behind the game. \n\n\n\n\nThis year at The Game Awards speeches were pretty time-crunched, and when Vincke initially spoke after Baldur's Gate 3 won Game of the Yeah, he was staring at a massive, blinking countdown. Standing in a suit of armor, he still managed to deliver some important \"thank you\"s , but if the speech felt rushed, it was. In a lengthy thread, Vincke expanded on some of his main points from The Game Awards and touched on some of the major issues affecting the industry right now. \n\n\n\n\nThe new speech begins with a light acknowledgement of what we…",

          "description": "Marvel's Blade was one of the most exciting reveals from the Game Awards. Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.\nLuckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:\n\nConcept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.\nFor more Blade, check out our episode of the GI show where we recap the biggest announcements from the Game Awards, or just watch the reveal trailer again.",

The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.\nLike all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. \nIn addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release.

I was fine to wait for a sequel years down the road, perhaps with Kratos and Atreus traversing through a new line of mythological lands and gods. But I wanted some reason to return to its beautiful world, adrenaline-inducing combat, and top-tier characters. \n\n\nWhen PlayStation revealed Ragnarök’s Valhalla DLC, I was immediately excited.

It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's \"Show Me Mastery\" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. \n\"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?\" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. \nThere is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.\nDecember 12, 2023\nGod of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. \nYou can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live. \nAre you playing God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC?

Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.\nThe noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.\nMouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. \n\n\nMouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.\" \nPierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business \"has blossomed in different ways,\" noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. \"That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.\" \nFor a recap of the history of E3, read The Washington Post's full story here.

The company, which is also behind the Transformers franchise (toys and other media),  announced this decision yesterday, on December 11. \nHasbro CEO Chris Cocks called the need for layoffs in an email sent to staff a \"lever we must pull to keep Hasbro healthy\" and \"a last resort.\" As noted by Dicebreaker, Cocks became CEO of Hasbro in February of last year and earns roughly $1.5 million in salary in the position – his total earnings for 2022 amounted to $9.4 million, however. \n\n\n\"While we're confident in the future of Hasbro, the current environment demands that we do m…",

          "description": "Terra Nil, the \"reverse city builder\" from developer Free Lives and publisher Devolver Digital, is coming to Switch next week. More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. \nWhile many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. \n\n\nAs you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. \nIf you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer's Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it. Listen to us talk more about it on this episode of The Game Informer Show after that. \nAre you going to check out Terra Nil on Switch next week? Let us know in the comments below!",

Now, as 2023 comes to a close, Google has released the top 10 trending searches in games on Google over the year and in the top slot is Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nWhile many were likely searching for new trailers, gameplay, and information about the game, there's no doubt some of the Google searching for this game stems from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's inflammatory statements about the trans community. Publisher Warner Bros. Interactive says Rowling was not involved with the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, which was developed by Avalanche, but given it's based on the Harry Potter franchise she created, she undoubtedly made money off of it. Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. \nAs for what that means, Google describes it like so: \"This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the 'trending' inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022.\" \nWith that in mind, here's the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023: \nHogwarts Legacy – Our Review\nConnections (if you, like me, didn't know what this was, it's a New York Times word grouping puzzle game) \nBaldur's Gate 3 – Our Review\nStarfield – Our Review\nDiablo IV – Our Review\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Our Review\nAtomic Heart – Our Review\nDead Island 2 – Our Review\nSons of the Forest\nMortal Kombat 1 – Our Review\nAnd here are the top 10 trending searches in the world for games on Google in 2023: \nHogwarts Legacy\nThe Last of Us\nConnections\nBattlegrounds Mobile India\nStarfield\nBaldur's Gate 3\nスイカ ゲーム (a Japanese puzzle game known as Suika Game or Watermelon Game)\nDiablo IV\nAtomic Heart\nSons of the Forest\nDo any of these surprise you?

Other destinations include a 3v3 arena mode and a 6v6 battlefield mode. See the game in action below.\n\n\nMecha Break currently has no release window or announced platforms.",

          "description": "The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.\nZau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.\n\nThe world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.\nSalim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.\nThe trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.",

Check out the latest trailer below.\n\n\nIn The First Descendant, you play as, you guessed, Descendants – a group of unique characters that each have distinct abilities and movesets.

The new trailer gives us a cinematic look at one of those fights, this time showcasing an entirely new Descendant.\nThere's no gameplay in this trailer, but the team assures fans that they're working to refine said gameplay, based on feedback from the nearly two million players who checked out their last open beta session. The main purpose of that beta was to test crossplay features, which makes sense, since the game is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

          "description": "Developer Sharkmob, makers of the battle royale Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodhunt, have revealed a new open-world extraction shooter called Exoborne.\nThe game is a tactical shooter set in an apocalyptic Earth that is being torn asunder by extreme forces of nature, such as massive tornadoes and lightning storms. These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nExoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). \nThe gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.\nCharacters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.\nExborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.",

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
