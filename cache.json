Then, thanks to services like the Virtual Console, you could emulate those old games without having to own any old consoles, for much more affordable prices than the ones you might find in second-hand sales.\nThen came the era of remasters, with updated graphics, controls, and sometimes even new content, and it was pretty exciting to be able to play old games on new hardware. But the riskiest re-release of all is the remake, which requires taking a beloved game, giving it a total makeover, and hoping that the end product is not an insult to the players' treasured memories. Very few game developers have taken this risk... but when it pays off, it pays off big.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Medieval city builders that pit you against enormous waves of enemies are clearly having a bit of a moment right now. In the last few months alone, we’ve endured the cursed nights of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand, called down sky lasers on the hordes of Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and now we’ve got ORX, a dark fantasy tower defence game that blows all of them out of their ditch water moats with its compelling mix of deckbuilding and real-time strategy. It’s not out in full just yet, but its demo got a substantial update this week, adding more levels and a bunch of game-changing cards to the mix that are well worth making a return trip for if you’ve only ever played the original half-hour version from 2020. I’ve lost several evenings to it already, and lemme tall ya, RTS turtlers have never had it so good. \nRead more",

          "description": "When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. \nIndeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.\nRead more",

In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.\r\n\n\r\nAlas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've ever played 2019's My Time At Portia (and given that game's popularity, statistics suggest a bunch of you have) you'll know the appeal. It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. \nBut now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack. \nRead more",

This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.\nThis means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.\nRead more",

So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting.

          "description": "Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.\nI'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.\nRead more",

          "description": "Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.\r\n\n Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.\nNot content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members.

While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.\r\n\n\r\nUltimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full. I’ll be coming back and adding more to the list as I test them, so you can see for yourself what uptimes to expect from your favourites.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a loots-be-shoot with a moreish loop urging you onward, boasting characterful art design and thick-lined scenery goading you to pause for yet another snap in photo mode. For Borderlikers, the gun compulsion and farty japes will be enough.

Alice Bee is away this week, adapting to life in a brand-new country, leaving Nate and Matthew to dwell on the merits of The Mandalorian, and whether a show following the life of a Halo grunt would be better than big flashy Master Chief quips.\nMatthew puts forward the idea of a Hitman TV show in the vein of Succession, focusing not on Agent 47, but the elite corporate villains he assassinates, as they deal with various cast members being offed in mysterious circumstances. Nate, meanwhile, wants to go all-in on a Dungeon Keeper sitcom, and The Office-like monster relationships therein. \nRead more",

          "description": "Diablo meets The Boys is the four-word elevator pitch of Stitch Heads and Raw Fury's new isometric hack and slasher - and judging from the amount of loot, blood and minced limbs I saw in my hands on demo last week, I'd say they're pretty bang on the money, albeit with an extra dash of Borderlands thanks to its cel-shaded comic book visuals. Whichever way you slice it, though, Superfuse makes a striking and violent first impression. \nPerhaps it's because I'm playing as its Berserker class, a large walking slab of man muscle whose axe and (comically large) fists can pulverise anything and everything standing in its way. Or maybe it's because the devs have given me free rein of the game's extensive skill tree, letting me pile in dozens of points into attacks, abilities and power-ups normally reserved for later on. Superfuse may be a loot-driven hack and slash with hundreds of different weapons and armour components to pick from, but its skill tree is equally vast, giving you as much flexibility in how your attacks play out onscreen as your various wardrobe choices - and some of its effects are deliciously gory.\nRead more",

Filling the graveyard has been a solemn bid for order in the wake of so much chaos.\nIt’s not that way in Bripton, the next town over. The graveyard there is uncannily empty, save for a similarly bare tree. But you can change that, should you so choose: shoot up the bank or fight a duel and, the next time you return to that settlement, new plots will have appeared for every life snuffed out. Weird West even suggests you head to the local cemetery to loot any bodies you’ve missed - though its reputational system implies you should ensure nobody’s watching first.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a strange thing, returning to the world of Death Stranding after more than a year away. Having done that classic thing of rinsing almost every last delivery out of it before finally strapping myself in for its rollercoaster ending back in 2020, there hasn't been much reason to return to my precious, daft BB Boys in the intervening months - not even its Cyberpunk 2077 crossover was enough to tempt me back. At long last, though, I have cause to load up the BB train again. Death Stranding Director's Cut arrives on Steam and the Epic Games Store today, bringing with it new story missions, new delivery buddies, new weapons and... a Mario Kart-style race track? Yep, that sounds like a classic Kojima upgrade pack, if you ask me. Not quite as revolutionary as Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, mind, but it's roughly in the same kind of ballpark. \nIt's been great fun revisiting the lush mountains of Death Stranding's definitely not Icelandic version of post-apocalyptic America. If anything, the weirdest thing is seeing that same world I know and love on a fresh server, bereft of all the distracting neon signs, yelps of \"Keep on keeping on!\" and one-upmanship bridge-building that made up the bulk of the original's asymmetric online multiplayer component. It's actually quite refreshing to see these virgin, unspoiled landscapes again, although I imagine this won't last long once returning players flock back to their well-worn delivery routes. As for the new new stuff, is it worth making a return trip? As with all expando games, the answer will very much depend on if and how much you played the first one. \nRead more",

This week we welcome our guest Bryan Vore back on the show as we take to the skies and explore the last game in this unfortunately short trilogy, Bioshock Infinite.\nBioshock Infinite started pre-production around the same time as Bioshock 2, but while 2K Marin was exploring the depths of the seas once again, Ken Levine and his team at 2K Boston/Irrational Games had their heads in the clouds. Focusing on American exceptionalism, Bioshock Infinite introduces players to the floating city of Columbia, an engineering feat inspired by the World's Fair attractions of yesteryear. We discuss the troubling development that miraculously came together late in the process as well as the main characters, Booker DeWitt and Bioshock's first constant companion in Elizabeth. And listen until the end as we reveal what's in store for the next season of Video Gameography!\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and former Game Informer Editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Bioshock released to date!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Following a disastrous debut trailer, in which the iconic blue hedgehog looked far removed from his appearance in every other form of media, the studio went back to the drawing board. Instead of discouraging the filmmakers, the backlash motivated director Jeff Fowler and the rest of the team to pay more attention to the enthusiastic fan base.\n“They were absolutely right to request us to work harder and to make adjustments,” Fowler says. “And then to come out the other side and for everyone to be able to high five and celebrate, it felt like we ended in a place where they were happy, and the film was a film that they could embrace.

In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.\nWarning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, some aspects of the narrative and characters are mentioned thr…",

If you haven’t yet played the first Rogue Legacy, you can do so now as it's a free game on Epic Games Store from April 7 through April 14. To celebrate today’s news, Cellar Door Games has released a new trailer on IGN showcasing some of what awaits players in the roguelite. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n“Rogue Legacy 2 is finally reaching v1.0 and we couldn’t be happier with how it turned out,” Cellar Door Games writes in a press release. “Our goal for Rogue Legacy 2 was always to make ‘Rogue Legacy 3’ because we didn’t want to settle for just more. It had to stay true to the original, but also stand on its own as something new. After nearly four years of development, bringing it to the fans is the final step in this long journey, and we hope they find it as special as we do.” \nThe sequel features a new art style – namely, 3D characters set against hand-drawn 2.5D backgrounds – new weaponry, abilities and classes, environments, and more. It also introduces Heirlooms to the series and Cellar Door Games says this pushes that “unique Metroidvania feel by permanently giving heroes new abilities.” \n“Alongside this, Rogue Legacy 2 vastly improves traits to bring greater value to their risk versus reward gameplay, as well as making significant strides in accessibility to let players succeed even when they’re struggling.” \nBe sure to check out these new screenshots from Rogue Legacy 2 while waiting for its 1.0 release on Steam and Epic Games Store on April 28.\nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\n\nAre you excited for Rogue Legacy 2?

Previous Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64 titles that have become available with the expansion include Paper Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, F-Zero X, Alien Soldier, Super Fantasy Zone, and Light Crusader. Mario Golf was well-received when it initially launched in 1999. A bevy of playable characters, including the titular plumber and his mainstay companions (Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, etc.) alongside several courses rendered in 3D for the first time in the golf-centric series impressed and excited a large swath of fans. \nGet into the swing! ⛳\n#NintendoSwitch for #NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members on 4/15. #Nintendo64 pic.twitter.com/bB4ujaj59F\nApril 7, 2022\nMoreover, wind strength, weather, and direction added nuance to the loop, making shots more rewarding. This success continued with the recent Mario Golf: Super Rush, released on Switch in 2021. Nintendo aficionado Brian Shea reviewed Super Rush and gave it an 8.25, saying:\n“Despite the underwhelming nature of the story mode, Mario Golf: Super Rush delivers plenty of golfing greatness. With a strong foundation and multiple fun avenues of play, Mario Golf: Super Rush carries on the long-standing tradition of Nintendo sports games by being a good time regardless of your fandom of the actual sport.”\n\nNow, players that might’ve missed out on one of the definitive entries in the Mario Golf series will be able to get a hole-in-one on the blocky prairies of the Nintendo 64 title on April 15. Hopefully, more Camelot Software Planning games will become available or even remastered (we’re looking at you, Golden Sun!).",

A tweet posted on the game's official Twitter account states, \"We will continue to maintain our servers for both Ghost Recon Wildlands and Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and we truly hope you will continue to enjoy the game and have fun playing in solo or co-op with your friends.\" Despite Breakpoint's end, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development. \nAccording to Kotaku, the next bombastic chapter in Tom Clancy's illustrious military universe is codenamed OVER. The title has reportedly been in the works for over a year now and could launch in 2023. As far as the fandom is concerned, this fast turnaround could be a good thing. Recent Ghost Recon experiences haven't found the same success as other Tom Clancy titles like Rainbow Six and The Division. Breakpoint, for instance, might have alienated its players after Ubisoft implemented its NFT-based Quartz beta into the shooter's cosmetic rotation.\nThe only announced and showcased mainline Ghost Recon game around the corner is Frontline, \"a massive first-person PVP shooter with epic 100+ player battles\" throughout a sandbox called Drakemoor Island. You can read more about the live-service game here. With XDefiant also on the horizon, it's worth pondering if the live-service model might also be a focus for the mysterious OVER project. Only time will tell.\n[Source: Kotaku]",

The highs and lows have been well-documented, but the Sonic movie franchise has been a source of happiness for gamers looking to see their favorite titles on the big screen. Sonic The Hedgehog 2 continues that trend of good video game movies, and we're sitting down with the cast and crew to find out how they did it.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nJoin Brian Shea as he sits down with Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and director Jeff Fowler to discuss all the things fans should look forward to in Sonic The Hedgehog 2. To kick things off, Ben and James chat with Shea about what it was like to film the live-action scenes when the former basically had to imagine his furry companion being alongside him. Ben also discusses some of his favorite Sonic games of all time and what moments he'd want to see in a future film.\nFrom there, we move to Colleen to discuss what it's like joining the stacked cast for the first time. She has been the voice of Tails for years through the games and TV series, but this is the first time she's getting to bring her character to life on the big screen. Finally, we sit down with Jeff Fowler to discuss bringing all those pieces together and delivering an experience Sonic fans are hoping for.\nDid you enjoy today's video but are curious if Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is actually worth seeing? Our own Brian Shea has seen it, and in his review, he says:\n\"Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.\"\n\nThanks as always for watching.

The announcement comes with word that Remedy has struck an agreement with Rockstar Games to develop the remake.\nThe deal is for Remedy to make one big remake encompassing both classic Max Payne titles. The game will be targeting a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and will utilize its Northlight game engine. Rockstar will be fronting the bill for development, which will be budgeted to be \"in line with a typical Remedy AAA-game production,\" according to a press release provided by Remedy. Remedy will collect royalties on the game after Rockstar has recouped its funding from development and publishing. No release window for the project was given. \nRemedy CEO Tero Virtala remarked on the agreement, saying, \"We're hugely excited to be working with our partners at Rockstar Games once again for the chance to bring the story, action and atmosphere of the original Max Payne games back to players in new ways.\" \nTake-Two, the parent company of Rockstar, owns the rights to the Max Payne IP, and Rockstar itself developed Max Payne 3, which was released in 2012. Remedy and Apogee Software sold the rights to the series for $10 million in cash and stock shares in 2002, a year prior to the release of Max Payne 2.  \nRemedy Entertainment's most recent games include Control, the campaign of Crossfire X, and Alan Wake Remastered. The studio is currently developing Alan Wake 2, a multiplayer game with Tencent codenamed Vanguard, and a multiplayer Control spin-off.",

This pursuit of power will also net you other items, including classic stadiums. You can get a Choice Stadium pack by playing horribly in one Mini Season game.\nAll you have to do is complete three errors in the span of one three-inning game to complete the \"Are you even trying?\" mystery mission. Adding terrible fielders to your roster isn't necessary; all you have to do is make terrible throws to first base. You'll likely lose the game, but you'll walk away with a classic stadium in return. The challenge expires on May 2, 2022.\nI played the game on Legend difficulty to ensure the CPU would make good contact. I lost the game 27 to zip. Yes, it took that long for three legitimate ground balls to be put into play.\nFor more on MLB The Show 22, check out our review in progress. This year's game is quite good on new-gen machines yet struggles mightily in the tech department on Switch. This is the first time the game is on Nintendo's platform, and it just isn't as smooth or polished as the other versions.",

The post shares a quote from Shiro Games CEO Sebastien Videl. He says, \"With so many massive Dune fans in the studio, the excitement I see every day of working with this universe is very real, and we hope this comes across in the game. With all this passion for the source material, and all the know-how we've gathered from making Northgard, we can't wait to put this game into players' hands.\" \nAs for the addition of the Fremen to Spice Wars, this marks the first time the now Arrakis-natives will be a main playable faction in any Dune strategy game to date. The Fremen are led by Liet Kynes, who holds dueling allegiances to her people and to the emperor as a planetologist. Her faction interacts with the harsh deserts of Arrakis more favorably than the feuding houses and smugglers they will contend against. The Fremen can move through the sands further before succumbing to exhaustion or attracting massive sandworms. They specialize in stealth and guerilla tactics and can make use of and ally with neutral territories.\nSpice Wars isn't the only game making use of the Dune property in development under Funcom. The publisher is also working with German studio Nukklear on an open-world survival multiplayer game set in the Dune universe.\nYou can play Dune: Spice Wars, the 4X and real-time strategy hybrid, later this month when it hits Early Access on PC through Steam.",

That's all I can say other than I'm thrilled with the project, and especially the team of really wonderful people,\" says Ross in the Tweet. \nI'm excited to announce I now work at the amazing Crystal Dynamics as Design Director. That's all I can say other than I'm thrilled with the project, and especially the team of really wonderful people.\nhttps://t.co/HjDFIFk7MF\nApril 5, 2022\nRoss leaves a palpable mystery hanging of which project he's attached to. We now know of two upcoming projects that Crystal Dynamics is working on: the just-announced Tomb Raider game running on Unreal Engine 5 and Xbox and The Initiative's new Perfect Dark title, which Crystal Dynamics was announced to be assisting with development in September 2021.\nWhether Jeff Ross is working on either of those projects or something else entirely is unknown. It seems the studio isn't lacking in exciting projects at the moment. Considering the call for more developers to join the team, Crystal Dynamics looks to be staffing up appropriately. \nCrystal Dynamic's most recent release is the live service superhero team-up Marvel's Avengers, which has seen its share of troubled development while revamping many of the game's progression systems and releasing new characters and content expansions since its release in 2020.\nOther than Days Gone, Ross was heavily involved in the design for most of the Syphon Filter series and Resistance: Retribution. Earlier this year, he spoke openly about his time developing Days Gone and the lack of a green light for a sequel despite the game selling millions of copies.",

Like the 80s and 90s movies that inspired it, the summer camp is very much a major part of The Quarry as is the cast of young people together there with little to no supervision. In it, nine teenage camp counselors are left overnight at Hackett Quarry, free of kids, supervision, and most importantly to the tropes Supermassive is riffing on rules. \nAs expected, things go awry and people start to die as “something far more sinister” begins to hunt them throughout the night, according to a press release from the studio. It will be up to you to control and interact with characters played by actors like David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Detective Pikachu), and Brenda Song (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Dollface), amongst others. \nIf you’re interested to see what all of this looks like in action, you now can, thanks to 30 minutes of gameplay from The Quarry’s gameplay, which is now live over on IGN as part of the publication’s month-long coverage of Supermassive Games’ latest. You can watch it below: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nFor more about The Quarry, be sure to read about the reveal of it from last month, and then check out this story about how Supermassive Games wants to avoid problematic tropes in The Quarry.  \nAre you excited for The Quarry?

However, if you’re looking for anything more about the game, that’s sadly all that was shared. \nCrystal Dynamics is incredibly excited about the future of Unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next level. That's why we're proud to announce that our next #tombraider game is being built on Unreal Engine 5! pic.twitter.com/UFMiWzJAZc\nApril 5, 2022\nHere’s what was announced, in full, by Crystal Dynamics’ Tomb Raider franchise general manager Dallas Dickinson: \nAs for what to expect from this Tomb Raider game, it will likely continue the story of the recent trilogy from Crystal Dynamics (with help from Eidos-Montréal on the final entry). However, that’s pure speculation – there’s always the possibility that Crystal Dynamics could reboot Tomb Raider once more, just like it did in 2013. However, the studio always referred to its trilogy reboot as an origin story for its Lara Croft so perhaps this new Unreal Engine 5-powered Tomb Raider will be the first game in the reboot’s timeline where Lara Croft is the tomb raider many think of when they hear the words “Tomb Raider.” Only time will tell. \nFor now, read about everything announced during today’s Unreal Engine 5 presentation, and then read Game Informer’s thoughts on the most recent Tomb Raider game in our Shadow of the Tomb Raider review. \nAre you excited for a new Tomb Raider game?

In Dreamsettler, you'll play as an internet private detective trying to solve problems for other users on the Somnius Sleepnet Systems. There will be all kinds of familiar references while surfing this shifted reality version of a burgeoning time for the web. You'll experience an early version of social media, listen to alternate-reality genres of music, and explore a version of the 00s internet that's much like our own but with some abnormalities. Although, No More Robots hints it will get weirder as it gets even darker.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nAlso announced is Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, a spinoff of sorts from the original Hypnospace outlaw starring ZANE_ROCKS_14, or Zane Lofton as he's known in the fictional real world. In 2022, 37-year-old Zane, who is now a manager at a DollarSaver, finds a game he made when he was 14 called Slayers X. Naturally, he decides to rerelease his boomer shooter (its very Doom-like) in 2022 with some upgrades. \nBoth games are slated to release sometime this year and will be coming to consoles and PC, but neither title has a date yet. \nAre you looking forward to playing these Hypnospace Outlaw spinoffs?
