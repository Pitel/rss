          "description": "A winner is you.\nBack in the days of the Nintendo 3DS eShop, some of you may remember the Denpa Men trilogy, which offered a series of cheap and approachable RPG adventures that felt like a great fit for the portable. However, there was a fourth title released only in Japan in 2014 which experimented with a free-to-play structure that proved reasonably popular. That game died with the ending of online services for the 3DS, so Genius Sonority has seen fit to retool it for the Switch era and release it worldwide as The New Denpa Men. It may not be one of the best free-to-play games available on Switch, but New Denpa Men still proves to be modestly enjoyable.\nThe narrative in New Denpa Men is hardly in line with the epic and occasionally drawn-out stuff that JRPGs are known for. Here, you command an army of Denpa Men—charmingly weird little dudes that look like a cross between a Mii and a Teletubby—to go on various quests geared towards helping various cutesy yellow creatures with long noses. The episodic structure works well with the bite-sized gameplay design, though it must be said that the localization here is NES-era levels of atrocious. Yet funnily enough, the broken English honestly adds to New Denpa Men’s quirky charm, as it feels strangely in line with the awkward vibe of the characters and world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "HAL be there.\nUnless you’re a dedicated Famicom collector, it’s unlikely that you’ve heard of Metal Slader Glory. Released right at the tail end of the Famicom’s life in 1991, the year after the release of the Super Famicom, Metal Slader Glory never made it out of Japan, and it proved to be a massive flop for HAL Laboratory. But the very magnitude of its failure helps to explain the close relationship that exists between Nintendo and HAL today, with the latter producing games like the first two Super Smash Bros. entries and the Kirby series exclusively for Nintendo consoles.\n“It’s famous for being one of the most expensive Famicom games of its time,” said Satoru Iwata of Metal Slader Glory in a 1999 interview with Used Games magazine (translated by Shmuplations). Iwata, who became president of HAL in 1993 and then president of Nintendo in 2002, worked as a producer on the game, which took four years to finish in a time when game development was often measured in months, not years. “It’s actually kind of amazing that we stuck to it, persevered, and eventually released it,” he continued, “but from a management perspective it was a mistake.”\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.\nIn broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from \"player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players\". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.\nStill, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.\nRead more",

I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.\nI cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'.

Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it.

Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide. \nRead more",

Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it's turn-based zombie crunching combined with roguelike scavenging to survive and get more powerful. It's arriving on Steam sometime soon and it's probably worth a looksy if you're after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.\nRead more",

In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.\nRead more",

I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.\nRead more",

Now you too can get one on the cheap, by way of a chunky Prime Day discount – and as if God himself was calling me a loser nerd, it’s the significantly brawnier RTX 4060 model to boot.\nRead more",

          "description": "With the AMD Zen 5 generation, the timing is interesting where it's not the desktop processors launching first but happens to be in the form of AMD Ryzen AI 300 series laptops. With the last minute delay of the Ryzen 900 series by 1~2 weeks, the embargo lift for the Ryzen AI 300 series is timed for this Sunday morning where I can now present the first AMD Zen 5 Linux benchmark results. And with being the first Zen 5 chip in my lab, I have been pushing it hard... Here is an extensive look at the ASUS Zenbook S 16 I received with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 current flagship SoC compared to a variety of other AMD and Intel laptop models. The focus was on both the raw performance and the package performance-per-Watt for the overall power efficiency of this Zen 5 SoC. And with it being the first Zen 5 hardware in the lab, I didn't limit the selection to just conventional laptop workloads but also explored the performance characteristics for various other workloads of interest to diverse Linux users and for an idea of the HX 370 potential or similar Zen 5 chips appearing in thin client / edge / IoT type devices. This initial taste of AMD Zen 5 has me extremely excited about the performance potential of the upcoming Ryzen 9000 series and EPYC Turin processors.",

While just an evolution of RDNA3, the initial benchmarks of RDNA3.5 graphics with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 are looking rather promising for both the raw graphics performance as well as the power efficiency.

Here's how to tap into that power for yourself.\n\n\nAjax nails the Titan fantasy better than Destiny 2\n\n\nAjax is different from other Descendants in that he is the wall upon which enemy swarms break rather than dancing through the battlefield. He is the epitome of the Void Titan fantasy in Destiny 2, but isn't hampered in the same way. \n\n\nMaking use of barriers, bubbles, leaping slams, and Void explosions, Ajax fe…",

          "description": "Warzone's Mobility challenges are all about mastering exploration tactics, leading players to diverse points on the map. In Season 5, the thrill of the game is heightened as you're tasked with visiting five unique POIs in a single match, a feat that can be quite challenging to accomplish. We're here to guide you through this adventure and provide solutions if you encounter any tracking issues.\n\n\nHow do you visit 5 unique POIs in a single match in Warzone?\n\n\nTo visit five unique POIs in a single match, travel to locations with a name before the round ends. This includes Urzikstan's POIs like Superstore, Low Town, and Orlov Military Base. Open your map to see the available POIs for the challenge. Unfortunately, the game may not track this progress, as several players have indicated that the 'Visit 5 unique POIs in a single match' can be buggy in Warzone.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAny time a new season drops, tracking progress seems to get the short end of the stick. It can sometimes take a few days for an update to pull through, thus fixing these issues. You can test it out by driving around Urzikstan or Rebirth Island. Then, check your tracked challenges to see if the bar has increased. If it hasn't, I recommend holding it off until a new patch rolls out.\n\n\nThis progression issue has plagued other challenges, such as the Cooperation Squad Assemble task. However, a new patch presumably fixed the problem a few days after Season 5 launched. The same could happen for Mobility's POI task, but we'll need to wait for an official update. Keep track of the CoD Updates page to see the latest fixes.\n\n\nMost modes, including Resurgence and Battle Royale, will work for the visiting POIs challenge. Superstore Resurgence is likely the only one that won't count toward it, given that only one POI is available.\n\nThe post How to visit 5 unique POIs in a single match in Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its destructive power helps you complete a couple of quests, but depending on how you use it, it can also completely turn the tides of battle. Let's find out how to find this peculiar Mythic-grade weapon.\n\n\nWhere to find Ship in a Bottle Mythic in Fortnite Cursed Sails event\n\n\nThe Ship in a Bottle Mythic item has a guaranteed spawn in barnacle chests. You can find these chests in Shipwreck Shallows and as a buried treasure reward. Alternatively, you can find it as rare floor loot or a drop from player eliminations, but this isn't nearly as reliable. \n\n\nIn Shipwreck Shallows, you'll find a large pirate ship full of treasure chests, including a barnacle chest in an office room. This chest is guaranteed to appear in every round, but you'll often find other players competing for the loot here. If you arrive here quickly, you can grab the Ship in a Bottle alongside a Flint-Lock pistol, shield potion, and other helpful items.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAnother option is searching around the Fortnite map for buried treasure maps. You can find them anywhere as chest and floor loot or as drops from other players. Holding a treasure map summons a blue arrow that leads you to a red X on the ground. Digging this spot with your pickaxe uncovers a barnacle chest that drops the Ship in a Bottle Mythic and other items like the Shipwreck Shallows chest.\n\n\nOnce you have the Ship in a Bottle, you can instantly use it like a potion, gun, or other items to activate its effect. It'll summon a massive ship, destroying structures and damaging enemies along its path. Although it isn't fast, it's large, making it a viable escape option in a pinch.\n\nThe post How to find Ship in a Bottle Mythic in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Weapon cases in Fortnite are great for obtaining new guns, especially early in a match when you're initially scrambling for items. They often hold rare and epic-grade weapons, allowing you to get powerful guns early on until you visit golden landmarks or Loot Island. Depending on the season, you might even encounter an event asking you to open weapon cases, such as during the Pirates of the Caribbean Cursed Sails event.\n\n\nWhere to find weapon cases in Fortnite\n\n\nPilfering weapon cases in Fortnite simply means opening them as you usually would. You can find weapon cases in landmarks like Sandy Steppes, Rebel's Roost and Reckless Railways or as a guaranteed spawn inside bunkers. If you want to open several weapon cases, your best bet is to visit a POI to claim a few before waiting for a bunker, entering it, and looting it. If you're lucky, you might even get the chance to open weapon cases in multiple bunkers during the same match.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou'll know you've successfully found weapon cases when you spot containers revealing weapons in their glass displays. Each case gives one gun, allowing you to grab multiple upgrades if you're early in the match or get lucky with the drops. Just be careful, as you may find other players looking to finish their quests or get a gun upgrade, too.\n\n\nWeapon cases also regularly appear as quest objectives, ranging from opening a few as a weekly mission to finding several during seasonal events.

Instead of sending out Subnautica 2 screenshots via the usual route, the studio has been teasing players with screenshots hidden in the original tame. \n\n\nAt least it's true according to a mod at the Subnautica subreddit. Two weeks ago, a player discovered a Time Capsule collectible with an image and a mysterious message. The image showcased some... odd-looking creature (a staple of Subnautica games, to be fair), along with the line: \"Hey um, found this on my way to the rocket. Is this thing new? Never seen it before! :O\" \n\n\n\n\nOh, and hashtag PEEPERSRULE. Because they do.\n\n\nSubnautica team baits sequel interest with some secret screenshots\n\n\nPlayers speculated that the image could be from the sequel, as the creature and environment didn't quite match the visuals of the prior Subnautica games. The moderator, Bumblebee_Tuna, swum on by to confirm that the image is real and that it's not the only one.\n\n\nTwo more Subnautica 2 screenshots have been discovered lurking in the deep dark of Subnautica. Last week, subreddit user JimRice18 shared the three images currently known to the community. From the looks of things, the first image was a pair of colorful fins. Surely, whatever nautical fauna this is must be something majestic and awe-inspiring and...\n\n\nImage via Unknown Worlds and JimRice18 on Reddit\n\n\nTruly one of god's perfect creatures. It could also be some kind of underwater Basilisk from a FromSoftware game, judging by those eyes. \n\n\nDespite the recent teases, Subnautica 2 will still be baking in the oven for a while. Last November, the developer confirmed the sequel won't arrive until an unknown date in 2025. The team went dark for a few months before returning to squash any rumors that Subnautica 2 would be a \"games-as-a-service\" release.

Let's take a look at who will be the top 10 WRs to watch out for when Madden NFL 25 goes live.\n\n\n10 best Wide Receivers in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nTo gauge who the best WRs are in Madden NFL 25, we have considered the OVR ratings. Here are the detailed stats of the top 10 names.\n\n\nName\nOVR\nSPD\nSTR\nAGI\nJMP\nINJ\nSTA\n\n\nTyreek Hill\n99\n99\n64\n98\n92\n92\n92\n\n\nJustin Jefferson\n98\n92\n64\n93\n97\n94\n98\n\n\nCeeDee Lamb\n96\n90\n70\n94\n96\n93\n93\n\n\nA.J.

Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb, with an overall of 96, has secured the third spot on the list. \n\n\nInterestingly, Tyreek Hill is certainly the fastest athlete as well. With a speed rating of 99, he's as quick as possible. With the new BOOM Tech-influenced mechanics, his pace could offer huge advantages when it comes to dodging tackles from the defense. \n\n\nAs of writing, EA Sports has released the ratings of Safeties as well, and Jessie Bates III, with an overall of 97, has secured the top spot in his position at launch. \n\nThe post Madden NFL 25 Top 10 Wide Receivers rankings (Launch) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Most Warzone Rewards give players some insight into their various objectives. However, the Redacted section is shrouded in mystery, concealing keywords from its description. We're here to show you all the Warzone Redacted challenges and how to complete them for Season 5.\n\n\nHow to complete Warzone Redacted challenges in Season 5\n\n\nFor a complete overview of Warzone's Redacted section, here are all the challenges in Season 5:\n\n\n\nGet 15 Operator Kills with a Suppressor Muzzle\n\n\nKill 10 downed Operators with a Throwing Knife\n\n\nActivate three UAVs at the same time\n\n\nComplete five Contracts after the Third Circle\n\n\n\nPlayers must equip any Suppressor attachment via the Gunsmith for the first challenge. You can also attach the Throwing Knife to hit two birds with one step. Then, buy some UAVs after completing Contracts and activate three simultaneously. Doing all the Warzone Redacted challenges in a single match is possible, but the last one will require some time.\n\n\nWait until the Third Circle triggers to complete the final Warzone challenge. The money earned from this can be used to make UAV purchases. Additionally, the Superstore POI's compact size makes it much easier to tackle these objectives. Participate in modes like Superstore Resurgence or Plunder Quads to get it done quickly.\n\n\nThe first three objectives provide cosmetic rewards, including the Feeling Dimensional Calling Card, Private Eye Emblem, and Skeleton USB Large Decal. Once you've achieved the last task, you'll earn the exclusive Decipher camo skin.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nEarn more rewards from the remaining Warzone sections, such as Combat Expertise, Cooperation, and Mobility. Unlike Redacted, these challenges will be much more straightforward with their clear-cut descriptions. Complete them all to collect the Sports Icon weapon blueprint, featuring a light machine gun with the handy Jak Glassless Optic.\n\nThe post All Warzone Redacted challenges in Season 5 and how to complete them appeared first on Destructoid.",

In this guide, we'll explain how to equip two pets in Adopt Me and provide information on a new update.\n\n\nHow to equip multiple pets in Adopt Me\n\n\nPlayers can equip two pets by creating a family or subscribing to Adopt Me Pets Plus. The subscription service is a new feature available on Aug. 1, 2024, at 8 a.m. PDT/10 a.m. CDT/11 a.m. EDT. It will cost $2.99 a month, separate from the VIP pass.  \n\n\nThe first pet will still have a list of needs, while the other has slightly fewer objectives. The Daily Bucks cap will also be increased, allowing players to earn more bonuses. Additionally, Pets Plus subscribers gain access to the VIP Room, Limo, and VIP House. It'll be great to use during the Adopt Me Sunshine Games event, where players can earn XP for exclusive gifts. \n\n\nImage via Uplift Games\n\n\nThe Adopt Me Pets Plus subscription offers much more content, including a crown, a Legendary Treat, and saves for your log-in streaks. If you happen to miss a day for a log-in, this service won't reset it back to zero, keeping your progress intact.\n\n\nBesides this premium system, players have found a way to have multiple pets when creating a family. You can set this up with another player or through an alt account. Then, pick up the second animal from the other account to place it in the party. \n\n\nUnfortunately, this technique may not always work, so you may need to opt for the Adopt Me subscription.\n\nThe post How to equip two pets in Adopt Me appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "World of Warcraft's newest expansion is peeking around the corner, and we have a pre-patch to tide us over until its release on August 26. Before The War Within, let's take a look at how to unlock some delicious purple cosmetic weapons (and Alleria's ranger bow) in the questline added this week. \n\n\nHow to begin the Hunt the Harbinger Questline in Dalaran\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to make your way to Dalaran to begin the new questline, Hunt the Harbinger. This questline is automatically added to your character's questlog if they're level 70. To get to Dalaran quickly, you can use your Legion Dalaran Hearthstone, or get there from your capital city's portal room. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe whole adventure begins and ends in Dalaran, so while you will be journeying a bit between steps (aided by the ability to use Skyriding on any flying mount thanks to the patch), you won't be straying far from home when all is said and done. \n\n\nThe whole chain consists of the following quests:\n\n\n\nThe Harbinger\n\n\nDoor to the Ren'dorei\n\n\nRiftwalker Reports\n\n\nCracks in the Void\n\n\nGalakrond's Unrest\n\n\nWalk a Mile in Her Shadows\n\n\nDark Descension\n\n\nLegacy of the Void\n\n\nThe Path Taken\n\n\nAnd Be One Traveler, Long I Stood\n\n\nDefend Telogrus Rift\n\n\nNull and Void\n\n\nRadiant Warnings\n\n\n\nThe whole questline take about 15 to 20 minutes, conservatively. In it, the pieces are set for The War Within's story. More important than that, however, is that at the end you'll get some sweet cosmetics that match perfectly with Void Elves' heritage armor. You'll also get void (deep blue/purple) scales for your Winding Slitherdrake. \n\n\nAs mentioned, the questline is auto-accepted and can't even be removed from your questlog. If you're still working your way through quests from, say, patch 10.2, just be sure to complete them in order if you care about continuity. \n\nThe post How to unlock the Voidtouched Arsenal in WoW Dragonflight appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some of these evolutions aren’t as simple as spending candy and pressing a button, though. \n\n\nThere are a large number of Pokémon who will only evolve after you’ve completed certain Buddy Tasks. These can be as simple as walking a certain distance, or catching a certain number of Pokémon of a certain type. In this guide, we'll go through specific Buddy Task evolutions. Others, such as the bizarre case of Inkay, will not be included. \n\n\nHow to select or change your Buddy in Pokémon GO\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOf course it’s no use simply doing these tasks if the required Pokémon isn’t set as your Buddy at the time. \n…",

Over the weekend, during the San Diego Comic-Con, the studio unveiled the first teaser trailer. \nLike A Dragon: Yakuza centers on Kazuma Kiryu (played by Takeuchi Ryoma) and follows his life during two time periods: 1995 and 2005. Set in the series’ fictional Tokyo district of Kamurochō, the trailer’s synopsis states the show “depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people” and will explore stories the games haven’t been able to. \n\n\nThe six-episode series will be released on Prime Video in two parts, with the first three episodes premiering on October 24 and the last three arriving on November 1. It will be subbed and dubbed in 30 languages. Like a Dragon: Yakuza is directed by Take Masaharu (100 Yen Love).\nYou can read our review of the latest game in the series, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, here.",

A new trailer provides the first look at gameplay, including glimpses of a couple of modes and character customization. \nQuidditch Champions features a single-player career mode that allows players to climb the ranks of the sport. Each victory takes them to larger, grander venues, from Hogwarts to the Quidditch World Cup Stadium. An online competitive mode pits teams of real-life players against each other. Playable characters include Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Draco Malfoy, but you can also create and customize your own athletes using an extensive character creator. \n\n\nHarry Potter: Quidditch Champions launches digitally on September 3 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. A Switch version is planned to launch sometime this holiday. \nQuidditch Champions will be available in two versions. The Digital Standard Edition ($29.99) simply includes the base game. Digital and Physical Deluxe Editions ($39.99) include the game, House Packs for Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor, and 2,000 in-game gold (earned in-game, as Quidditch Champions does not have microtransactions). The house pack includes a broom skin, travel school uniform, and crest emblem representing each house. The Physical Deluxe Edition goes on sale on November 8. \nAdditionally, the Standard Edition will launch as a PlayStation Plus title on day one and will be available to subscribers until September 30.",

It unfolds after the events of the story campaign and centers on the invasion of Titan Havik from an alternate reality, who seeks to spread anarchy across all timelines.\nThe expansion's cinematic story introduces new playable characters, Noob Saibot and the now female Sektor and Cyrax. These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24. \nIn keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films. Scream’s Ghostface, Terminator 2’s T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian are on the way, but there’s no release window for their arrival. Kombat Pack 2 comes included with Khaos Reigns and cannot be purchased as a standalone character bundle. \n\n\nAnimalities are making their return as a free content update upon Khaos Reigns’ release. First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents. The trailer reveals Mileena can turn into a giant, horrifying praying mantis, for example, and a press release states every playable fighter will have an Animality (which would include the movie-born guest fighters for an interesting thought). \nSpeaking of free content, today, owners will receive the MK95 Scorpion skin modeled after his appearance in the live-action 1995 Mortal Kombat film. \nKhaos Reigns launches digitally on September 24 for all platforms MK1 is available on. It will run for $49.99 on every platform except for Switch, where it costs $39.99. You can read our review of the base game here.",

During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.\nAs reported by Variety, producer Roy Lee (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, The Lego Movie) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s announcement in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”. \n“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”\nA partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life. In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) was announced as its writer in August 2022.\n[Source: Variety]",

That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.\nThe game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house. \n\n\nDate Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (Critical Role, Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines. \nDate Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window.

The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.\nAdditionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12. \n\n\nThe delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was formally unveiled in 2020 after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled plans for NFT implementation. The biggest disruption was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and sadly perished in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during Summer Game Fest this year.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the Xbox re-release of the original games that arrived earlier this year.",

If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its first trailer, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it. \n\n\nBorderlands is directed by Eli Roth and stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Arianna Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis).",

          "description": "Warner Bros. Games has acquired Player First Games, the developer of its cross-over platform fighter MultiVersus. The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a press release, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White. \nThe announcement comes only a couple of months after MultiVersus' relaunch on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. shuttered the entire mobile division of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios. \n“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”\n“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”\nMultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version here), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as The Joker, Agent Smith, Jason Voorhees, and the recently announced Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice.",

Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.\nArriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come. \n\n\nEscalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting \"a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.\"\nFor more on Helldivers 2, check out our review.",

The game is also getting a ranked mode.\nSamurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. \n\n\nSeason 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.\nMultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC.

Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now. \nThe game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.\n\n\nSVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.",

Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.\nPulls ♾️\n@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS\nJuly 22, 2024\nFor the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word \"cyber\" in its name.\nIt's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.\nThe Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.\nhow do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game?

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. \nA cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. \n\n\nHeihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.\nFor more on Tekken 8, check out our review.",

The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. \n“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”\nAfter years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. \nFor our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode.

          "description": "Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \n\n\nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.",

          "description": "Fallout, a TV adaptation of the popular post-apocalyptic video game series, was released on Amazon Prime this past April. Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.\nFallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations. Secondly, Walton Goggins was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for his portra…",

          "description": "Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",

Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.\nFor those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. \nAlthough it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:\nPress the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.\nNavigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.\nChoose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds\nSelect the background art you want using the A button.\nYou can read more about the impending Xbox 360 store closure and final updates by visiting this Xbox Wire article.",

          "description": "Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. \nTomb Raider Chapter\nLara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:\nFinesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.\nHardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.\nSpecialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.\n\n\n2v8 Mode\nOn July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. \n\n\nCross-Progression\nCross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. \nToday’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.",

This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. \nDeveloped by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.\n\n\nWe still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. \nThe Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",
