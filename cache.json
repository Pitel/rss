Enter Nuala Studio with Vengeance Hunters, a fledgling project that’s notable for its development platform, the Neo Geo, a 34-year-old piece of arcade hardware.\nVengeance Hunters doesn’t shy away from cliche. Its introduction pans over a brooding city skyline while describing a dystopian future under threat from “High rolling suitmen. Captains of industry. Bastards of the upper crust.” Vaguely political, then. Enter three protagonists, the awkwardly titled Candy, Golem, and Loony; an athletic female, a bulky robot, and a brawny part-cyborg male, respectively.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

More than three years after its initial reveal, the game is finally here and it’s a bold but confused take on the tactics genre that has some big strengths. But, those are counterbalanced with a number of roadblocks and obstacles that often get in the way of the enjoyment you can have with it.\nTo start things off, this reviewer is coming at this as a turn-based tactics fan with no personal history with the Metal Slug series. When it comes to offering something for genre fans, Metal Slug Tactics succeeds, mostly. The game is actually structured as a roguelike, so you and up to two other characters you select from the Peregrine Falcons will head out and take on various, small missions in isometric grids one by one until you gain full control of an area of the map.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths.

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.\nAnd then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.\r\n \nRead more",

And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.\nRead more",

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.\n“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.\nRead more",

Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.\nUntil then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.\nIn fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.\nRead more",

The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. \nRead more",

The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally.

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended?

          "description": "I didn’t get much further in the extremely popular beta for the haute-couture-asaurus action of Monster Hunter Wilds than perfecting the exact orange-to-white ratio of my cat. Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.\nRead more",

This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants.

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.\n Read more",

It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

Sin very nearly liked Stasis: Bone Totem, landing positive despite giving up after several hours. That’s also my experience with Beautiful Desolation - an isometric RPG I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again. This might be a coincidence, but whatever else can be said about these projects, one thing is for certain: when compared to upcoming horror FPS Animal Use Protocol, they both featured considerably less monke.\nRead more",

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into \"Adventure Points\", used to \"unlock\" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at \"ancient history\" for a while. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery. \nRead more",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.\nWe are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.\nIf you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.\nNow go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM's Global Main Menu.\n>",
