          "description": "Rip and Shred until it is done.\nIf there ever was a genre that was perfect for Switch, it has to be roguelikes. The pick-up-and-play nature of them is perfect for getting a game in on your commute or on your work break. Another ironically great genre for a Nintendo platform is the First Person Shooter, thanks to the inclusion of gyro-aim. Mash these two together with a side helping of rhythm game and you get BPM: Bullets Per Minute; a game we were very excited to finally get on Switch. However, for as good of a fit as it is in theory, the little hybrid console that could struggles to keep up with this heavy metal hero.\nBPM places you in control of one of the Valkyries of Norse mythology, as you battle through different realms such as Asgard and Helheim to defeat the Nidhogg. The catch is that everything you do in the game — from shooting, reloading, using abilities, and even jumping — must be done to the beat of the fantastic metal soundtrack. Much like the 'boomer shooters' that inspired it; BPM is tough as nails and lightning fast, requiring you to always keep moving or get sent back to Valhalla.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This week we're talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley's Blackbird.\nI do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?\nRead more",

          "description": "I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to \"the fat chapter\", and the others all went \"Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!\". Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn't fit anywhere else. Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.\nThis year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on 'em.\nRead more",

In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. \nBut the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.\nRead more",

Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.\nAt its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.\nRead more",

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.\nAlas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow. \nRead more",

I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In it, we're whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You're Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband's new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.\nThis takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It's a bit too easy, in fact.\nRead more",

          "description": "The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. \nIn Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line. \nRead more",

Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It's ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it's invaluable.

But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Today's PAX West interview is with the one and only Ron Gilbert, series creator of the iconic point-and-click adventure series, Monkey Island. We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.\nGilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island's world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game's story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won't wanna miss that.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.\nNeowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.\nOverall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!\nRead more",

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.\nTo call Northern Journey \"retro\" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action.

I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.\r\n\n\r\nVentura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Now one unofficial Flash Player emulator is adding support for more classic games, ones made in the (relatively) newfangled ActionScript 3 language. So you can party like it's 2008 by heading over to Newgrounds and playing You Have To Burn The Rope again, as well as Wonderputt and a handful of others.\nRead more",

Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.\r\n\n\r\nWhile it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as \"Project Code Name 'M'\" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes.

          "description": "Today was due to be the day when some older Ubisoft games would see their online services decommissioned, but the company is granting them a temporary reprieve. You now have until October 1st to cram in some multiplayer for several early Assassin’s Creeds, the original version of Far Cry 3, Driver: San Francisco and others. Ubisoft say they’ve been “exploring what is possible to reduce disruption” over the last month, hence the shuffled date for decommissioning.\r\n\n \nRead more",

For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.\nRead more",

          "description": "We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.\r\n\n\r\n“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It looks like Overwatch 2's heroes will unlock via the Battle Pass.\nThe Watchpoint Pack, the paid version of the upcoming free-to-play multiplayer portion of Overwatch 2, includes the first season's premium Battle Pass track. And a since-removed portion of that description (via Polygon) notes unlocking heroes via the Battle Pass.\nOverwatch commercial leader and Blizzard VP Jon Spector addressed this on Twitter, describing it as \"incomplete info posted early\" about the Battle Pass.

          "description": "Victory Road (Champion Rank), Herba Mystica (Path of Legends), School Troublemakers (Starfall Street)\nNintendo has finally detailed the three core Pokemon Scarlet and Violet storylines, and they'll deal with the following the classic Victory Road \"I wanna be the best\" journey, as well two other concepts called Path of Legends and Starfall Street. All of this is touched on in a recent trailer, but it's really broken down in a really detailed way on the official site.\nHere's the gist:\n\"Three stories will be woven into your adventure while traversing the sprawling Paldea region. Along Victory Road, you will go to Gyms in different locations in order to achieve Champion Rank. On the Path of Legends, you can join Arven in search of rare ingredients. And in Starfall Street, you’ll challenge Team Star, a group of delinquents causing trouble for the school.\"\n\nSo everything is finally coming together. One core feature of this generation was the ability to tackle three storylines in any order, and now we have the full scoop on the themes and characters involved with all of them. Putting in Victory Road and a nemesis plot is a no-brainer and is kind of incorporated into every game anyway: but the third option of finding the Herba Mystica is intriguing (especially with the wrinkle of \"Titan Pokemon\" playing a part).\nOn paper this sounds like a cool idea, especially for folks who only have time to pick the game up for moments at a time. Instead of working toward one lengthy and arduous storyline, they can attempt to finish three smaller ones. Of course, how well scaling mechanics are implemented remains to be seen.\nThe post We have a rundown of the three Pokemon Scarlet and Violet storylines appeared first on Destructoid.",

And it's also free on the Microsoft Store, too.\nWith the new platform and popularity likely comes players wanting to either experience the game properly, or rekindle their old memories. And so id Software has announced that it's deployed some official dedicated servers for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, to facilitate all the nostalgic carnage.\n\nThese servers are running the vanilla Enemy Territory Campaign ruleset, with all six original maps and no mods. While id says there are servers with a variety of mods and custom maps that it highly recommends, some folks want to play the classics.\nThe classic, vanilla dedicated servers are set up across multiple regions, so players around the world can hop in. Four official servers have been deployed: Texas, the Netherlands, Canberra, and London.\nAll servers will even have a message of the day, saying the following:\n\"Official & Vanilla Servers hosted by id Software. Enjoy! These servers are unmoderated. For issues, help.bethesda.net\"\n\nBack to the past\nIt's really cool to see id Software supporting renewed interest in an older game like this. Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory was a bit of an outlier, from what I remember of its launch.

The first two chapters of Deltarune were released back in October 2018 and February 2019 respectively, so it's been quite a while since fans have seen an update on the game. This week, however, Fox took to Twitter to provide a much-needed Deltarune update.\n\"We don't be able to put out any new chapters of DELTARUNE this year,\" Fox said. Well, at least he's straightforward. Then he teases \"something special\" coming up to celebrate the anniversary of Undertale and Deltarune Chapter 2, so there's something coming relatively soon.\nWe'll just have to hold out a bit longer. For what it's worth, you can't really blame Fox for taking his time considering he's pretty much the only one who works on these games. Making a game at all is an impressive enough feat, let alone doing all the coding, art, music, and so on completely by yourself.\nhttps://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1566962055470784519\nIn the meantime, though you can get your next fix of Undertale at an awesome pop-up event — so long as you live in Southern California, anyway.\nFrom September 15 through October 10, Requiem Café in Anaheim will be hosting an event in honor of Undertale's seventh anniversary, which includes special themed food and drink items like colorful macarons and milk tea, as well as exclusive merchandise like shirts, mugs, tote bags, and more. The café is not taking any reservations for the event, but walk-ins are of course welcome.\nIf nothing else, a delicious peach tea with strawberry and spicy mango and some chocolate blood orange donuts will be enough to get me by. Make sure to check out the menu, because it all looks amazing.\nThe post Toby Fox says not to expect another Deltarune chapter this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

The shop management sim from developer Voracious Games and XSEED hits PC via Steam on October 17.\nIn the fantasy world of Potionomics, the story follows Sylvia, an eager upstart who has taken over a potion shop after her uncle has disappeared. Despite very little knowledge in the way of potion making and selling, Sylvia has to keep the shop afloat amid stiff competition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6YDmnRZMYY\nThe loop of Potionomics runs through a few different genres. There's the store management aspect, where Sylvia can put out new products and upgrade the store to better serve customers. Then there's brewing potions, and trying to keep up with needs.\nOnce a customer wants to buy something, it turns into a card-based duel where Sylvia's ability to haggle turns into a Slay the Spire-style encounter. And there are social links with the townsfolk, which given one moment in the trailer, could possibly bloom into romance.\n\nA pinch of this, a sprinkle of that\nPotionomics has a lot going on, but in the demo I played at PAX East, it really managed it all well. Every system fed into the other, and the feeling of setting potions to brew, opening shop, haggling for profit, and conversing with others felt smooth.\nIt's why Voracious Games' store management sim has been on my radar since PAX. And luckily, the wait's not long now for the final game. Though the regular game will be on Steam for $24.99, XSEED is also releasing a Deluxe Edition that will have a digital artbook and soundtrack for $39.99. And sorry, no haggling those down, aside from a brief launch window discount.\n\nA demo is also on the way for the upcoming Steam Next Fest, so players can check it out before release.

          "description": "A fancier controller that's a little easier on the budget\nXbox is adding a new variant to its line of Elite Series 2 controllers. For those looking for something a bit more straightforward and a little cheaper, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller is on its way.\nThe Elite Series 2 has been popular, alongside its predecessor. But at $179.99 MSRP, it is also a bit hefty in the price tag. That's where the Core comes in.\nThe new Xbox Elite Series 2 Core controller has the \"essential\" components of an Elite Series 2, with fewer bells and whistles. There's still adjustable tension on the thumbsticks, a rubberized grip, and hair trigger locks. Button remapping is also fully available through the Xbox Accessories app. And it comes in at $129.99 MSRP, a full $50 cheaper.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/…",

          "description": "From ONE OK ROCK\nA new Sonic Frontiers song has appeared, this time it's one of Sega's signature vocal-heavy Sonic songs. From the Japanese rock band ONE OK ROCK, it's titled \"Vandalize,\" and will serve as the ending theme of the game.\nHere's what ONE OK ROCK's lead vocalist (Takahiro Moriuchi, also known as \"Taka\") had to say about the collaboration:\n\"We partnered with Sega on Sonic Frontiers because we relate to Sonic and how he’s taken on the world after getting his start in Japan. We are based in the US and have performed in Europe, Asia and South America, so we are extremely happy to be able to work with the world-renowned Sonic.”\n\nYou can watch the preview clip below via Sega with in-game footage, or listen to the song directly through the band's YouTube channel. The timing is perfect for ONE OK ROCK, as they're currently touring the US right now, and their new album is out on Friday.\nI'm in it! This is one of the cleaner, best-foot-forward showings of the Sonic Frontiers marketing campaign so far. If they led with this and the Cyber Space footage, I think the reaction would have been completely different.\nSonic Frontiers Vandalize preview clip with game footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knz-3qUmTHg\nSonic Frontiers Vandalize full song:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U1jO4KL60Y\nThe post Sonic Frontiers reveals its vocally-backed ending song, Vandalize appeared first on Destructoid.",

Additionally, a Screen Share option will allow players in parties to watch each other's embarrassing performances, while a cute sticker system allows you to send small icons and images to your friends via Game Base. Send me some stickers. In addition, the DualSense has had a minor tweak for stability, while Voice Command (in English) has been added to the YouTube app.\nThe Game List feature allows players to sort their games into folders, allowing you to group titles by genre, franchise, developer, or whether Juri is in them. PS5 users can have up to 15 lists in total, each of which can hold up to 100 games each — which is pretty funny once you consider a PS5's SSD is full to capacity once you add three games and six screenshots — or just one Call of Duty title.\nThe Version 22.02-06.00.00 update is now live on PS5.

The popular crossover fighter will welcome the mischievous Mogwai Gizmo to its ranks, joining a star-studded crossover cast including characters from Game of Thrones, DC Comics, Steven Universe, and more.\nWhile developer Player First Games is yet to release an official gameplay trailer for the gremlin, it has revealed Gizmo's gameplay card, which reveals that the Mogwai is a Support class character with an array of moves to attack his foes and aid his partners. Gizmo will come equipped with his Rambo-style \"Hunter's Bow\", as seen in the climax of 1990 sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch. This tool will allow Gizmo to fire projectiles at the opposing team, and it can even be charged for full, flaming Tippex glory.\nhttps://twitter.com/multiversus/status/1567249291260854275?s=20&t=PPGSc95EgyQqW7seuJQcDw\nA support move, \"Song of the Mogwai\", will see Gizmo hum his famous little tune from the Gremlins movies, this move will cause the spawning of music notes, which apparently cause harm to his opponents — pretty bizarre given the adorable nature of the critter's singing. Perhaps Gizmo's most useful tool, \"Gizmo-a-Go-Go\", sees him leap onto his partner, piggyback-style, wherein he will instantly remove any debuffs or negative status that has been applied to his teammate. While hitching a ride, Gizmo can continue to fire his arrows at his opposition... I've said \"opposition\" a lot, because Gizmo has no enemies.\nGizmo will arrive in MultiVersus tomorrow, September 8, as the second DLC character of season one, (following Morty of Rick & Morty fame). The remainder of the season will see Rick, DC Comic's Black Adam, and Gizmo's arch nemesis, Stripe, also join the fray...

          "description": "We don't want it, 2K\nFifteen years later, BioShock remains one of the most recognizable and beloved series in gaming, and publisher 2K is still releasing updates to support the series. Or, more specifically, to make the games run through their own launcher, as evidenced by the patch notes from both older updates and a new one (via PC Gamer). This time around they even labeled the patch as a \"Quality of Life Update,\" when all it did was enable linking to 2K accounts and added the new launcher \"which includes a store to purchase new content.\"\nSo they're forcing yet another game launcher on us, but what really has fans peeved is that this new update has rendered the games unplayable for players running them on Linux. At first, it seemed to just be BioShock Infinite that was affected, but now it's looking like the entire series is a bust. The Linux Gaming subreddit is full of players decrying the changes, and trying to find solutions to fix the problem. Some players are expressing their wish that Steam would let them access earlier builds rather than forcing them to use the most recent version, and I'm kind of surprised that wasn't an option already.\n\nNaturally, fans took to the review section on Steam to voice their discontent, where one user said that 2K's launcher is riddled with bugs, crashes, and corrupted saves.\nI have my BioShock collection on my PlayStation so I'm in the clear, but man, I am feeling the frustration on behalf of PC gamers. Here's hoping that 2K gets the message soon and decides to scrap the launcher altogether, or at the very least releases a patch to fix the games for Linux users.\nRecently I've been partial to arguments about why it's important to own physical media, and I have to say this situation is only pushing me further into that camp. If I spent money on a game, I certainly want to be able to play it without the meddling of a company years after the game's release.\nThe post BioShock is unplayable for Linux users with new update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Aside from that, we speculate more on Breath of the Wild 2 and if the Zelda IP is about to make a big splash on Switch in the next year.\nJeff Grubb recently stated on his Nintendo podcast that a source told him Nintendo is planning a Direct during the week of Sep 12. He also mentioned the very high likelihood of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess being announced for Nintendo Switch during the showcase. I think these ports are long over…",

          "description": "Ubisoft is turning up the AC for this Forward\nUbisoft is set to discuss what's on the horizon this weekend, during its Ubisoft Forward stream. And several reports say that a healthy amount of Assassin's Creed will be there.\nBloomberg reports today, confirming other reports, that Ubisoft is set to announce several new Assassin's Creed games this coming Saturday.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Fr3cS3MtY\nAccording to Bloomberg's sources, Ubisoft plans to show off a mobile title and two major games. The first is code-named Red and set in Japan, being developed by Ubisoft's Quebec City office.\nThe second is code-named Neo or Hexe, according to Bloomberg, and is set during the later Holy Roman Empire, specifically revolving around the witch trials. This is being developed by Ubisoft Montreal.\nBoth of these are reportedly part of Assassin's Creed Infinity, a platform for the series that will contain multiple settings that has been previously reported on. Neither game is expected to release until 2024 at the earliest.\nThe future of Assassin's Creed\nUbisoft has already confirmed it plans to showcase Assassin's Creed Mirage as well. Though it hasn't revealed further official details about that game, it has been the subject of leaks and reports as well.\n\nSuffice it to say, we'll likely be seeing a lot of Assassin's Creed this weekend. And while it might not be everyone's cup of tea, I'm actually pretty interested in all of this.\nAssassin's Creed taking a platform approach could be interesting. I enjoy the more recent games in the series but never got around to finishing Valhalla due to how huge it was. Focused experiences with a bunch of different time periods could be intriguing.\nEither way, it won't be long until we know for sure. Ubisoft is airing its Forward stream this Saturday, at 12:00 p.m. PT / 3:00 p.m. ET. You can watch it on Ubisoft's Twitch channel here.\nThe post Several Assassin’s Creed games are reportedly set to be revealed this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a little bit of Overwatch mixed in with mobile suits.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVWpQDJtxHk\nGundam Evolution will feature mainstays from throughout the Gundam-verse, duking it out on the field of battle. Today's trailer spotlights a melee-configured Zaku with some hefty axe swings, the Mahiroo from Turn A Gundam, and the titular Unicorn Gundam.\nThese, alongside classics from throughout the series, all have their own weapons and abilities they bring to the battlefield. Personally, I'm rooting for the Guntank. He may not be as shiny as something newer like the Barbatos, but darn it, the Guntank is cool.\nMatches feature several objective-based modes, including Destruction, Domination, and Point Capture.\nA new type of Gundam battle\nThe PC launch of Gundam Evolution is currently set for a global launch on September 22 in Japan, which puts it at 7 p.m. PDT on September 21 for North America.  The launch will also mark the start of Season One.\nThere will also be cosmetics to purchase, of course. So if you want to deck out your mobile suit to stand out from the crowd, feel free to do so. It worked for Char, after all.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFI6v49v68\nWhile Steam players get in on the carnage right away, console players will have to wait. Currently, the team is planning to launch Gundam Evolution on December 1 in Japan, or 6 p.m. PST on November 30 in North America.\nOnce the end of November rolls around, Gundam Evolution will launch on both the current and previous generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles.\nThe post Gundam Evolution is a free-to-play hero shooter going live on Steam this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

A controller, headset, and console cover for the PS5 are all getting gray camo, as part of a new collection for PS5 owners.\nThe Gray Camouflage Collection variants of the PS5 DualSense controller and Pulse 3D wireless headset. Alongside those accessories, there is a console cover for both the disc drive-less and disc-capable PS5.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qDTET_tvY\nIn the accompanying PlayStation blog, Sony says the pattern subtly incorporates the iconic \"PlayStation Shapes\" into the pattern. And it's true, they are in there, as little details you can notice between the splotches.\nThe Gray Camouflage Collection will be available this fall, with pre-orders starting next week. The DualSense wireless controller and PlayStation 5 console covers will roll out first, with a global launch on October 14. The Pulse 3D wireless headset is set to roll out sometime in December.\nTactical fidelity\nSony has been steadily rolling out a number of console covers. In June, the console manufacturer launched several different variants, including Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, and Nova Pink. That's alongside the previously available Cosmic Red and Midnight Black.\nWhile I haven't opted to pick up a new color for my PlayStation 5 yet, I did pick up a Midnight Black DualSense. It's a pretty nice controller, and has lasted a good while.\nAs for the actual functionality of the camouflage, I cannot say. The sheer size of the PS5 might make obscuring its presence in your living room difficult.\nStill, if you're looking for different options for DualSense controllers, the Gray Camo will at least make your PS5 controller fairly distinct. No price has been announced yet, though console covers have usually gone for $54.99 and DualSense color variants tend to add a little extra.\nThe post Sony is rolling out Gray Camouflage accessories for the PlayStation 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. \nGrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. \nOnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. \n\n\nFans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment.

          "description": "PlayStation told players in 2020 that it could add 1440p support for game resolution output to PlayStation 5 “if requested enough.” It seems that happened because it’s now available in a new update. \nWith the launch of today’s new global PS5 system software update, not only is 1440p resolution available for applicable TVs and monitors, but Gamelists and other anticipated social features are too. There’s also a new audio comparison option to listen to the difference between stereo output and 3D audio in headsets and a new YouTube voice command preview. \n“The update includes several highly-requested features like 1440p HDMI video output and gamelists, as well as social features like the ability to request a Share Screen from a fellow party member, easily view new friends’ profiles, and receive a notification to help you join a friend’s game more quickly from a party chat,” platform experience senior vice president Hideaki Nishino writes in a new PlayStation blog post. “Additionally, you can now compare 3D audio and stereo audio on the same screen and more easily access in-progress Activities from game hubs.” \nFor more information about these new features, head to this breakdown here. \nThis system software update will allow players in the U.S. and U.K. to preview the ability to search YouTube through voice command. \n“Another feature we’re excited to bring to more PS5 players is the ability to search for content on YouTube through Voice Command (Preview),” the blog reads. “From anywhere on PS5, including during gameplay, you can say ‘Hey PlayStation, find [keyword] on YouTube.’ The YouTube app will open, and relevant search results will be shown.” \nhead to the blog post here.",

Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.\n1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. \nAs such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. \nYou can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):\nSplitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.",

It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

          "description": "Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: \n\nFor more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that. \nWhich Hogwarts House are you in?

          "description": "After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.\nThat's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. \nAssassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/92LoEcrrWs\nSeptember 1, 2022\nIf rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!\nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. \nAre you excited about Mirage?

          "description": "In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",

In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  \nI spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you’ll learn about Kratos’ tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available …",

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.",

It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.\nHřebíček writes: \n“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition. \nWhat do you want to see in a new Mafia game?

          "description": "Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. \nThis news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.\nKeep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),\nbut beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!\nScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.\nTo play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build.
