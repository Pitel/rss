          "description": "Confounded by the Rayz.\nThe limited edition retailers are getting out of hand again. The Ray'z Arcade Chronology, originally released in Japan back in March, and published by Taito for Switch and PlayStation 4, is receiving a European release courtesy of ININ games. Bizarrely, ININ Games are releasing two different compilations: this, the Ray’z Arcade Chronology, and the RayStorm X RayCrisis HD Collection. The latter, available in both physical and digital versions, only includes the HD touchups of RayStorm and RayCrisis, losing RayForce from the lineup. This makes it more a nerfed edition than a limited edition, and its existence somewhat baffling. Confounding things further, Strictly Limited Games have already released and subsequently sold out of its own physical version of the Ray’z Arcade Chronology, which contained all three titles plus an exclusive in R-Gear, an unearthed, unfinished prototype RayForce sequel.\nThe thinking behind these chopped-up, multi-licensed variations is bizarre, and sadly R-Gear isn’t present on ININ’s digital Ray’z Arcade Chronology. Despite this, it’s a fine package thanks to seasoned port-masters M2. Presentation is excellent, with nicely bound menus and plenty of information attached to its various screens. On board are five versions of three games, in that RayStorm and RayCrisis feature both original and new high-definition versions. Much like we saw with G-Darius HD, these remasters are beautiful enough that the originals are relegated to little more than historical curios; and, unless you’re using a CRT in an attempt to replicate the original look, they’re wholly overshadowed by M2’s upscaling work. That said, M2 has included a 'no burn-in' screen option precisely for people interested in running the games on old tech.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"this chapter is shaping up to be a pretty strange one\".\nIt has been almost two years since our last instalment of Deltarune, Toby Fox's follow-up to Undertale and, given the three-year wait between the first two chapters, this isn't all that surprising. However, Fox has recently shared an update on the development of Chapter 3 to keep us all in the loop about what's going on (thanks, Nintendo Everything).\nReleased as a part of his free newsletter, Fox noted that progress is still being made on Chapter 3, with the team working on the final overworld area for the instalment. After this, it looks like the chapter should be almost ready to go with Fox stating that he will need to give it a thorough once-over — though he hopes that this won't take too long.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Thought is the labour of the intellect, reverie is its pleasure\".\nMovement is such an integral part of the Trails/Kiseki series – both in a literal and figurative sense. The focus on transportation, walking, and familiarising yourself with the geography and inhabitants of Zemuria is paired with moments of political navigation, those who refuse to move on, and people growing from their mistakes. And after the events of Trails of Cold Steel IV, there’s a lot of movement – people are trying to move on from the events of five months ago.\nIn The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie, there’s plenty of player movement – moving between characters and stories – coupled with the aftermath of the Great Twilight. While recovery is slow and change is imminent in the Erebonian Empire, the state of Crossbell is at last reclaiming its independence. These are two nations in flux, moving on from the past. But there are new forces that threaten to disrupt this new chapter for Zemuria. This results in a solid and unconventional entry in the Trails series, albeit one that feels like a bit of a cheap excuse to get all of your favourite characters together.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developed by Outerloop Games, Thirsty Suitors is a story-driven adventure game where you play as Jala, our young protagonist, who returns to her family home only to find her relationships in disarray.

Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre.

DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.\nNaturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games.

The game is a real platter of genres, mixing flavours of RPG, management sim, visual novel and more to create a unique kind of experience that made a real splash while it was in early access. Dave's quite popular tenure in early access had three chapters to its name, but the full release takes that number up to seven alongside new weapons, areas, and features for the deep-sea-explorathon.

Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.\nOh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.\nListen and subscribe via your podcast provider of choice!

This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.\n\"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting,\" Abé tells me. \"That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay.

One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs. \nRead more",

No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. \nHere’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.\nRead more",

It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.\nRead more",

I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess?

Regardless of Gollum's quality, though, seeing developers fall on hard times is never a good thing. Hopefully, those affected can find a new path forward in the industry.\nAs for Lord of the Rings video games, well, this seems to have salted the earth on Gollum. It feels like it's been a bit since we saw the last great LOTR game. Return to Moria is currently set for a fall 2023 release date, so maybe that can rattle the dust off the series a bit.\nThe post The Lord of the Rings: Gollum studio Daedalic is shuttering internal development appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, I forgot to save at one point and lost more than two hours of progress, which really took the wind out of my sails.

          "description": "Another Diablo 4 developer update livestream\nMark your calendar. Blizzard has set the date for the next Diablo 4 developer livestream: July 6th at 11AM PST. The stream will feature Lead Game Producer Timothy Ismay and Associate Game Director Joe Piepiora as they detail some upcoming quality-of-life updates and officially announce Season 1 of Diablo 4.\nApparently Diablo Immortal will also make an appearance in the stream to discuss a new class coming mid-July. This is a bit strange as the two games certainly don't share the same player base, even if they are both Diablo games. Either way, you can catch the dual livestream on the official Diablo Twitch channel.\nhttps://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1674826164995604484\nQuality-of-life and Season 1 details are coming for Diablo 4\nI have to admit, Blizzard's handling of Diablo 4 post-release has been pretty spectacular so far. The recent patch 1.03 we received on June 27th fixed a lot of bugs, provided a ton of class balance changes, and added a ton of quality-of-life (QoL) features to the game. Experience gains have increased all over the game, and Nightmare Dungeons are more rewarding to run. With quality-of-life updates being a focus of the livestream, I imagine we'll see even more improvements on the way.\nMore importantly, Season 1 information is on the way. Executive Producer Rod Fergusson already confirmed we'd be getting the release date next week, which will probably be in this livestream. Furthermore, I think we'll get some details on the new features and content coming in the first season. This will probably include details about the Season 1 battle pass. Unfortunately, we know there will be no leaderboards just yet.\nIf you're interested be sure to check out the Diablo 4 developer update livestream on July 6th at 11AM PST.\nThe post Don’t miss the Diablo 4 developer livestream on July 6th appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A \"bit\" of news\nFirst launched by Choice Provisions (formerly known as Gaijin Games) in 2009, the Bit.Trip series has endured a lot. The fact that it's still standing after getting its start on the much-maligned (but beautifully scored) WiiWare service almost 15 years ago proves that it has legs. Now those legs are moving into the maker space with Bit.Trip Rerunner; a brand new title in the franchise.\nOriginally there were six games in the Bit.Trip story (Beat, Core, Void, Runner, Fate and Flux), but then Runner really took off, inspiring two numbered sequels and one free mobile spin-off. Both of which featured Charles Martinet (best known for voicing Mario) in a prominent role. So in a roundabout way, it makes sense for the Bit.Trip Runner subseries to continue to follow in Mario's footsteps with this new \"Maker\" title.\nDetails are scant, but the Choice Provisions Twitter page tells us that Rerunner will have \"Over 150 new levels, each with increasing challenges\", a new \"Runner-Maker tool to create and share your own levels\" and \"gameplay mechanics inspired by the original Bit.Trip games\".\nThe feature I think most Bit.Trip fans will want to see is the option to play with the original voxel visual style. Mario Maker definitely spoiled us by giving us Mario 1, 3, World, and \"New\" modes to play with. Unbeknownst to many, the Bit.Trip Runner series has used five distinctly different visual styles in past games as well (voxel, Atari 2600-style flat sprites, NES-style sprites,  2D drawings, and rounded polygons), so the options are already there.\nWe may find out if Rerunner will rerun all four of those looks when we see the game in action!\nThe post Bit.Trip makes a comeback with Bit.Trip Rerunner appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!\nAs you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:\n\"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi.\"\n\nGiven the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.\nThere's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum\nIn other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.\nAll you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time.

Alongside those platforms, the studio says an Xbox version of Baldur's Gate 3 is still in the works. It's just a matter of getting it ready.\nIn a community update around the announcement, Larian said it's optimistic about Baldur's Gate 3 on the Xbox Series X. But in order to announce and release on Xbox, the studio will need to \"ensure the game is performing without compromise across the entire Xbox X|S ecosystem.\"\nEssentially? \"Like with the PS5 version, we'll release it when it's ready,\" Larian said. \"We'll update you as soon as we can.\"\nSplitting the screens\nLarian head Swen Vincke went into more detail about the status of the Xbox version in an interview with IGN. Vincke noted both the freedom of the game itself, and the split-screen co-op, as causes for its troubles. Vincke told IGN that Larian may have to make some \"compromises\" to get an Xbox version live, though he didn't specify what they were, and didn't want to confirm that would be the case for-sure.\nVincke also confirms that Larian is working with Microsoft's Xbox Advanced Technology Group (Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on the matter to IGN).\nAs the interview goes on, Vincke does say that the team's ambition is to release Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X|S this year, but it can't commit to that. Again, it's ready when it's ready.\n\"This one's not exclusive. You're going to be able to play it. It's just a matter of patience. This is really a question of time,\" Vincke said.\nAs for PC and PS5 players, the wait for Baldur's Gate 3 has shifted a bit with today's news. PC players will get the massive RPG on August 3, while PS5 players have to wait just a little bit longer for September 6.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 will release on Xbox ‘when it’s ready’, Larian says appeared first on Destructoid.",

Coming to us from developer Outerloop Games, it takes skateboarding, combat, and cooking and drops them into a slice-of-life casserole. “Battle your exes, disappoint your parents, find yourself,” the trailer says. Yeah, I can totally relate to all of those things on a nauseatingly deep level. It’s all about going back home and seeing familiar faces again. That sounds like hell! Count me in!\nhttps://youtu.be/4LIj46_R62M\nThere’s a lot here, so it’s fortunate that Destructoid’s very own Eric “Peachfuzz” Van Allen went toe-to-toe with its demo last year. I’m still not entirely sure what to make of this whole thing, but Thirsty Suitors looks pretty awesome. It brings together relatable themes gussied up with some irresistible weirdness. I don’t know what I’m looking at, but I am entirely on board. There's currently a demo that you can check out if, like me, you are curious about what this game has to offer.\nThirst Suitors releases for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch platforms November 2, 2023.\nThe post Thirsty Suitors lusts of a November 2 release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "JACKPOT! JACKPOT! JACKPOT!\nLoot your change drawer, Zen Studios has confirmed that Pinball FX is going to drop on Switch next week. July 6, 2023, to be precise.\nTo be clear, this is the–I don’t know–reboot of Pinball FX. Because they got up to Pinball FX3 and then decided to start the sequence over. This is especially interesting because you can already get Pinball FX3 on Switch. Pinball FX is kind of built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4. I’m not sure why that’s necessary, but it means that your tables don’t carry over from the previous Pinball FX games. That kind of puts a damper on things.\nhttps://youtu.be/GSZYXzYaEaw\nBut, hey, it’s free to play. You get a one-day pass to try out everything. Afterward, you’re left with three tables you can play in unlimited fashion: West Rampage, Fish Tales, and Sorcerer's Lair. Tables after that are bought a la carte, or in small bundles. Other versions allow you to buy pinball coins or a pinball pass as another way of playing, but this won’t initially be part of the Switch version. The Switch is getting 21 tables that the platform hasn’t had before, so that’s something.\nI still feel scorned by the fact that Zen Studios got their hands on the Williams and Bally licenses, which were previously held by Farsight Studios for their game, Pinball Arcade. I loved Pinball Arcade because it felt like it was trying to be extremely faithful to the tables. It was kneecapped after losing those licenses and never recovered. However, Zen Studios seems to have gotten better about their authenticity, so maybe I’ll eventually finally migrate. It just still hurts, you know?\nPinball FX is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms. It releases on Switch July 6, 2023.\nThe post Pinball FX flips onto Nintendo Switch next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s more Resident Evil 4 flavor, with less fat!\nIf you’re unfamiliar with 2022’s Save Room, so am I. It’s an inventory management puzzle game based on the best part of 2005’s Resident Evil 4: the inventory. The goal was to arrange the various oddly-shaped objects into the limited space of the inventory case.\nSave Room: The Merchant shifts the concept closer to the Resident Evil 4 singularity. You’re made to think outside the case as you purchase items from the legally-distinct merchant character to prepare for the rigors of a level. You just need to make sure your adventurer has everything they need while trying to balance your pocketbook. There will be 40 bespoke levels that promise “relaxing music and sound effects.”\n[caption id=\"attachment_389499\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Fractal Projects[/caption]\nSave Room was something of an indie darling, so it’s great to see it continue on its legally-distinct way.

And Sony has accidentally let some budgets info slip about Horizon Forbidden West and The Last of Us Part 2.\nAs spotted by outlets like The Verge, Sony submitted a document with redactions.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.\nDespite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. \nThe PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay.

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it.

It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: \n\n\nAs you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. \nThirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2. \nAre you going to check out Thirsty Suitors this November?

          "description": "In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license. This means the teams and stadiums of the…",

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters.

However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. \nWhat’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well.

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue. \n\n\n\"Time was limited,\" Bond said in court, according to IGN. \"We had players whose expectations w…",

The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.\nThe Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.\nSonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.\nPlayers will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.\n\n\nWhile Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.\nSonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. \nLocalization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region.

Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. \nHowever, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.\n\n\nToday's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\" \n\"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you,\" Hines said, according to IGN.\nBethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today. \n[Source: IGN]\nEditor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.",

Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.\n\n\nWave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer.

The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. \n\n\nThis enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks.

During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.\nWhile the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises \"valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider.\" \nThe Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season.

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
