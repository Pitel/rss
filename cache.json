          "description": "Not exactly the cream of the crop.\nFans of the farm sim genre have been eating well in recent times, thanks to a boom in enjoyable new releases and remakes. Heck, even Natsume's newest Harvest Moon is kind of good! Yet it was only a few years ago when Switch owners didn’t have anywhere near as many options, and it was in this period that My Time at Portia released. Offering up a jankier take on the Rune Factory approach of farm sims, it offered up a passable experience that nonetheless helped to fill an important gap in the broader library. Since that release, developer Pathea has been spending its time working on a sequel, My Time at Sandrock, which many were hoping would meaningfully improve on the flaws of the original. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really do so. My Time at Sandrock still offers up a reasonably enjoyable take on the farm sim formula, but its poor graphical presentation, litany of technical issues, and general lack of a distinct identity really drag it down.\nGameplay follows the expected trappings of a farm sim, wherein you slowly build up an impressive property via tending to crops and livestock, all while building relationships with various locals and participating in the occasional festival or gathering. Even in the desert, seasons change and you have to plan out how you time your planting and take care of your animals, even as new seasonal alternatives become available. It’s well-worn gameplay by this point, but it’s still fun to engage in. There’s something remarkably satisfying about diligently tending to your tasks every day and watching your equipment quality increase as your property gradually expands.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Good Form.\nAs much as we loved 2021's WarioWare: Get It Together!, it's definitely an entry in this barmy franchise that's ended up dividing opinion over time. With little in the way of truly engaging multiplayer options, no real core gimmick, or any significant attempt to utilise the Switch's unique control opportunities, some folks (not us, mind) felt that it didn't do enough to really make its mark. It's also been suggested that the game's large roster of characters, each with their own mechanics, ruined the simplicity at the heart of the fun, making for one too many decisions to be made before you got to the main meat of the microgames.\nNow, after waiting ages for Get It Together! to come along, just two years down the line we've got another brand new WarioWare adventure to dig into. WarioWare: Move It! makes some big shake-ups to its predecessor, wisely bringing back the motion-controlled madness of Smooth Moves and giving us more ways to engage with other players. This feels like the classic Wii experience reinvigorated, and a more fully fleshed-out entry than 2021's effort overall with regards to cooperative and multiplayer options.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Come sail on a different sea of stars.\nThe Star Ocean series has always occupied a weird spot in Square’s massive catalogue. This sci-fi-focused JRPG series started off relatively strong, but the last few entries have been middling at best and just plain not good at worst. Nonetheless, those earlier games were really something at the time, and 1998’s Star Ocean: The Second Story has been widely seen by fans as the pinnacle of the series. Though Square gave it an enhanced remaster on PSP, it’s now decided to revive this classic once more as Star Ocean: The Second Story R, a remake built from the ground up with modern features, and we’re thrilled to report that this revisit is a complete success. Star Ocean: The Second Story R manages to preserve everything that was great about the original while adding tons of extra features and content to make this the definitive version.\nThe story of Star Ocean 2 is set 20 years after the events of the first game and follows dual protagonists Claude and Rena, one of whom you pick as your lead character at the beginning of a new file. Rena is from a distant planet named Expel, while Claude is a member of the interstellar Earth Federation, which travels the stars and contacts new civilizations. Claude and his father, the admiral, are investigating a mysterious disturbance with a ground team on a recently discovered planet when Claude foolishly approaches an alien object that teleports him across the universe to Rena’s planet.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While it's perhaps not the most pristine package that we were hoping for, it's nevertheless a solid (ha!) compilation that provides the perfect entry-point for newcomers and a good dose of nostalgia for veterans.\nWith Konami now seemingly poking its head back into the world of 'AAA' game development after an extended hiatus, it's admittedly got us thinking: what exactly do we want from Metal Gear now? After all, a recent video featuring none other than David Hayter, voice actor for protagonist Snake, is causing waves in the community thanks to a rather intriguing promise that \"this is only the beginning\" (which, we admit, is likely just in relation to the 'Legacy Series' itself, but we can dream).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online NES library — and its official debut in North America nearly 40 years after its Japanese launch on Famicom.\n\nAs far as obscure releases within the NES library go, Devil World is certainly one of the most interesting. Originally released in Japan in 1984 and in Europe in 1987, this is a title that to this day has never been available to purchase in North America — not even through the wonders of Nintendo’s Virtual Console service. Nintendo of America originally passed on the title at the time of release due to self-imposed rules on the use of religious icons and themes appearing in its games. The subsidiary's stance has evidently relaxed since then, yet Devil World nevertheless remained in the depths of unreleased game hell in the region until its 2023 debut as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Large gaming monitors can reach some crazy-high prices - so what's to stop you from getting a smaller 4K TV instead? You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won't give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. \nThis leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles. \nRead more",

I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. \nAlan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.\nRead more",

The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.\nRead more",

It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly?

I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.\nIn contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.\nRead more",

Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. \r\n\n\r\nI played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a \"sleeping old one below\". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.\r\n\n \nRead more",

These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing \"good progress\", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.\nFurther afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that \"crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy\" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. \nNow, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual \"next-gen\" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: \"I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do.\" \nRead more",

No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.\nBut dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards.

Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time.

Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.\nThe sandship, or rather, \"grainwake\" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. \nHappily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, \"Objection!\" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend. \nRead more",

Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot.

          "description": "Crytek's Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter's wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0's enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.\nRemedy's plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka \"Final Draft\", which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake's fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves \"an independent government organization\" that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. \r\n\n\r\nSo why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. \nAlan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet. \nRead more",

          "description": "At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map \"powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline\".\nI've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.\nRead more",

Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it's jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare's original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be \"unfair\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” \r\n\n\r\n\r\nPétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A few weeks ago I wrote about Grand Theft Auto players describing the movement of planes in random GTA promotional art as evidence of a forthcoming GTA 6 reveal, timed to intersect with the waning gibbous moon. I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.\nCome now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare. But it turns out that when you draw lines on it using MS Paint, you end up with the below. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive's lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.\nThe game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Puzzle game Suika, or 'That Watermelon Game', is currently having a bit of a moment online. It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. \nThe goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I'd probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I'm honest.\nRead more",

Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.\nI wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards.

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will \"absolutely\" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions.

This brings the total revealed fighter count to 30, with the final two character reveals coming on November 2 and November 12. Fan-favorite character Devil Jin is one of the four characters revealed today, alongside Zafina, Lee Chaolan, and Alisa Bosconovitch.\n\n\n\n\nFour new Fighters join Tekken 8\n\n\nDevil Jin returns as the “Blank Wings of Ruin,” Jin’s demonic side coming from the devil gene in his blood and the embodiment of him living with his sins. Devil Jin’s appearance matches his name, and his fighting skills are beyond human capabilities.\n\n\nThe “Mystic Stargazer” Zafina brings back her unique fight style rooted in her warrior heritage and her spiritual abilities as a mystical astrologist. Her methods are as old as her lineage, using Ancient Assassination Arts in her attacks.\n\n\nLee Chaolan fights with Martial Arts, but his true power comes from the Violet Suit, a one-of-a-kind battle suit that uses sophisticated technology and unleashes attacks that reflect his “Silver haired-Demon” persona.\n\n\nAlisa Bosconovitch is the “Destroying Automaton” developed by the brilliant scientist Dr. Bosconovitch. Alisa’s fighting skills come from her high-mobility flight suit and her arsenal of technological weaponry.\n\n\nTekken 8 is scheduled to release on January 26, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Four new Tekken 8 characters revealed including Devil Jin appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're the creative type, the latest Grounded update should be right up your alley (or backyard). Later this month, Obsidian Entertainment will introduce the Playgrounds mode — a creation toolset that enables players to create within the world of Grounded.\n\n\nThe new Playgrounds mode was introduced via the Xbox Wire today. It's a creation suite that can be compared to Halo's Forge mode or Forza Horizon 5's EventLab. \n\n\n\n\nGame director Adam Brennecke said that \"this feature has been on the backlog for a very long time.\" The idea for Grounded's Playgrounds stems from the ingenuity of the modding community. The Grounded development team at Obsidian is relatively small, so instead of directing resources towards new content, Brennecke and the team decide to craft the Make It and Break It set of building tools that enables the game community's imagination to run wild. \n\n\nBrennecke says that the Make It and Break It is impressively malleable. Essentially everything in the game is at your disposal creatively. \"We’re going to provide the tools, and someone’s going to make something magical,\" he said.\n\n\nPlayers can build buildings, place furniture, create obstacles, implement creatures, and of course, larger bosses. You'll even have the ability to install specific sounds and music into specific locations and scenarios. The vast majority of Grounded's campaign assets can be utilized for creativity. It's extremely customizable, \"down to individual blades of grass.\"\n\n\nThe new Make It and Break It free update will roll out for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 13. In addition to Playgrounds, the update will also consist of new challenges for Burgle quests, fresh base-building assets, and combat adjustments.\n\n\nGrounded is available via Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. See what other big titles are headed to the subscription service soon right here.\n\nThe post Grounded gets its own Forge with Make It and Break It update this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

System Era is best known for its open world survival crafting title Astroneer. At the time of this post, Astroneer has nearly 100,000 user reviews on Steam with a 92% positive score.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the post, Devolver Digital almost became the publisher for Astroneer years ago. Despite that not coming to fruition, the two companies stayed in touch culminating in todays acquisition.\n\n\nSystem Era assures fans that the company, brand, and team are not going anywhere as a result of the acquisition. The company plans to continue working on Astroneer, while also working on a new project they have already started on. For Astroneer in particular, there is already a roadmap through 2024.\n\n\nThis is one of those situations that just makes sense. A popular indie title like Astroneer is a great fit with Devolver Digital as a publisher. I have almost 100 hours in total in Astroneer over the years, playing several times with a couple friends.

Cygames, Inc. announced a delay that pushes Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising to December 14, 2023. \n\n\nRising was originally set for November 30, so the wait is just a matter of a couple weeks. According to the press release, the delay was put in place to \"allow for additional fine-tuning.\" Cygames apologized to fans who were looking forward to diving in at the tail end of November. When it launches, the Arc System Works-developed fighter will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. \n\n\nScreenshot via Cygames, Inc.\n\n\nEarly access action\n\n\nWhile Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising has been delayed, that doesn't mean November will be completely bereft of battles. The second open beta test will be held from November 9 to November 12 on all three platforms. In addition to cross-platform multiplayer, the open beta will offer up access to the Grand Bruise Legends! party mode. Look for more details to be announced via the official social accounts soon. \n\n\nEarly Access play will be available for those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition from the PlayStation Store. With the delay in place, the Early Access date has been shifted to December 11, with the caveat that there may be changes to the schedule between now and then. PlayStation Store pre-orders also come with a bonus PSN Avatar Set, which isn't currently planned for post-launch release in other forms. The set includes avatars for Gran, Djeeta, Siegfried, Nier, Narmaya, Beelzebub, and Seox. \n\n\nIf you're itching for Granblue Fantasy Versus showdowns in the meantime, the first game is currently on sale on the PlayStation Store and Steam between now and November 8. It's currently $1.99 on the PS Store and $3.99 on Steam. \n\nThe post Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising release pushed back to December 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you like to make or download mods for games like Resident Evil or Monster Hunter, it seems that Capcom doesn't share your enthusiasm. In fact, when it comes to anti-cheat and anti-piracy measures, Capcom seems to believe mods should be \"defined as cheats.\"\n\n\nThat's according to a recent presentation on the Capcom R&D YouTube channel (thanks, GamesRadar). A section of the video dedicated to the \"state of cheats and piracy in PC games\" asks whether anti-cheat or anti-piracy tech should target mods.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the presentation acknowledges the popularity of modding, it regards them as a form of cheating, at least in relation to anti-piracy software. Specifically, it mentions \"mods that are not officially supported by the game.\"\n\n\nDoesn't necessarily say Capcom will be cracking down on them\n\n\nThe video goes on to say that unofficial content is \"impossible to distinguish from cheat tools,\" though it concedes that the majority of mods \"can have a positive impact on the game.\"\n\n\nHowever, Capcom outlines some concerns about modding, such as \"reputational damage\" or mods that are \"offensive to public order and morals.\" On top of this, there's the potential for games to become corrupt or damaged which can add to workload for customer support teams.\n\n\nWhat this means going forward isn't clear. The presentation strongly implies that Capcom's R&D department is not 100% in favor of unofficial content for games. While there's no indication the developer is looking to clamp down on mods, it seems clear that the video is concerned about how cheats (or mods) may harm a company's reputation.\n\nThe post Capcom wary of ‘reputational damage’ from mods, equating them to cheats appeared first on Destructoid.",

And now Lenovo has just launched its Legion Go device, which could blow Valve's efforts out the water.\n\n\nWe knew the Lenovo handheld was coming on Halloween, but boy did those weeks fly by! Promising PC gaming on the move, with a QHD+ display screen, detachable controllers, all working through Windows 11, the Legion Go may make the Deck poop itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, you can see a side-by-side comparison of the specs over on Videocardz. The Legion device is powered by AMD Zen4 and RDNA tech, while the Valve machine is using Zen2 and RDNA 2, so the latter is already starting to trail behind.\n\n\nThe Steam Deck may want to up its game\n\n\nWhile there's nothing wrong with the Steam Deck, we can already see the advances that have been made in mobile gaming in less than two years. The fact that Legion Go has a 1TB variant and a slightly better battery life will probably be appealing to some.\n\n\nHowever, with that extra juice comes the price tag. Over on the Lenovo website itself, the 512GB model is currently selling for $699.99, while more storage will set you back an extra $50.\n\n\nGiven that we might not see a new Steam Deck for a couple more years, there may be a bit of danger for Gabe Newell and his team. No doubt Valve will have something up its sleeve, but in quite a short amount of time, we've seen a number of gaming handhelds try to muscle in on the Deck's territory.\n\nThe post Steam Deck rival Lenovo Legion Go is out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

Announced via X (Twitter) and YouTube, SEGA and Hardlight's Sonic Dream Team will launch exclusively on Apple Arcade on December 5th.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a post via Apple, Sonic Dream Team is a new 3D action platformer that follows Sonic and the gang as they stop Doctor Eggman. This time, he has discovered a dream manifestation device called The Reverie. As Sonic or a host of playable friends, folks will navigate insane dreamscapes, rescue allies, and avoid Eggman's goal of world domination. \n\n\nDream Weaver\n\n\nScreenshot via Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube\n\n\nDespite the title being exclusive to Apple Arcade, Sonic Dream Team looks to be pretty fleshed out. We have our usual Tails, Amy, and Knuckles, but we also get Rouge the Bat and Cream the Rabbit (alongside Cheese the Chao). This will be Cream's first playable appearance in a main game since 2019's Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\n\nAs for gameplay, it looks pretty similar to Sonic Lost World, with players being able to navigate stages freely in 3D. However, it also looks to be open world to a degree, though how vast the world may be has yet to be seen. Boss battles are also present, as we see Sonic fight a giant enemy crab (not that one) and Tails battle a laser-shooting robot. Regardless, the worlds look vibrant and fun, which is typical for a series such as Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\n\nA new animation is also shown in the trailer, sporting some impressive visuals. The studio that created the animation is Powerhouse Animation Studios. They have previously animated for the Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence short and the cinematics for Sonic Origins. Outside of Sonic, Powerhouse is responsible for the Castlevania animated shows, most recently Castlevania: Nocturne. \n\n\nSonic Dream Team launches on Apple Arcade on December 5.\n\nThe post Sonic Dream Team, a new 3D Sonic, announced for Apple Arcade appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get ready for a deep dive into the unknown, because the 1992 NEC PC-9801 visual novel, Dead of the Brain has received a fan translation.\n\n\nSo, backing up, the PC-98 is the last of a line of NEC computers released through the ‘80s and into the ‘90s in Japan. I could get more technical about it, but basically, these computers provided dedicated ecosystems to games, and they largely remained in Japan, where they were popular. This means that there’s an entire beloved subset of games that most Westerners were locked out of. Even among the more informed retro gamers, the games remained obscure, but awareness of them has been growing. Within the indie market, games like Stonks 9800 and World of Horror have even coopted their aesthetic (PC-98 and PC-88, respectively).\n\n\nImage via Romhacking\n\n\nAnyway, Dead of the Brain was the first in the “Nightmare Collection” which wound up consisting of three games. It’s a point-and-click adventure game mixed with heavy visual novel elements. What makes it stand apart is its extremely gory presentation. In fact, I don’t even know what else to say about it, other than the fact that it’s very gory as well as some potential nudity – but not the fun kind.\n\n\nDead of the Brain was also released on the PC-Engine (TurboGrafx-16), MSX, FM Towns, and Sharp X68000.\n\n\nNonetheless, with the growing popularity of NEC’s PC lineup in the West, it’s the perfect time to get a fan translation. The crew behind it state that this translation was made from the ground up and is not related to the PC-Engine or Retronomicon PC-98 translations.\n\n\nIf you’re interested, you can obtain the Dead of the Brain fan translation patch over here.\n\nThe post Gory PC-98 adventure game Dead of the Brain gets a new fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will drop November 9, 2023.\n\n\nWe’ve also got a solid list of all the tracks that are to be included in this final wave:\n\n\nAcorn Cup\n\n\n\nTour Rome Avanti (Tour)\n\n\nDK Mountain (GameCube)\n\n\nDaisy Circuit (Wii)\n\n\nPiranha Plant Cove\n\n\n\nSpiny Cup\n\n\n\nMadrid Drive (Tour)\n\n\nRosalina’s Ice World (3DS)\n\n\nBowser Castle 3 (SNES)\n\n\nRainbow Road (Wii)\n\n\n\nThat’s a pretty good list. DK Mountain was the indisputable best course from Mario Kart Double Dash. Perhaps the best in the entire Mario Kart series. With Bowser Castle 3, I always like to see Mode7 tracks get a glow-up. Then, finally, I always love torturing my family using Rainbow Road. It’s nice to have another rock to throw.\n\n\nBeyond that, we’re also getting some new racers that were previously announced. Diddy Kong and Funky Kong will be joining the DK Crew (Hungh!). Making their debut in the Mario Kart series is also the fan favorite Peachette, and Pauline, who I’m constantly explaining what game she’s from to my family.\n\n\nAlso, there are 16 new Mii costumes added to the mix, including one based on Daisy which can be unlocked by scanning her Amiibo. Finally, they’re implementing a music player so that you can listen to your favorite tracks from your favorite tracks without it being overlaid with “Yahaa! Waheeey! Wahwahwahwah!”\n\n\nAll of this gets released as part of Wave 6 of the Booster Course Pass DLC on November 9, 2023. Just in time for the sacred holiday of Black Friday.\n\nThe post The Mario Kart 8 Booster Course Wave 6 is out November 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Studio Wildcard's ARK: Survival Ascended launched on October 25, and though it currently sits with a mixed reception on Steam, it has been gobbled up by players worldwide. \n\n\nOn launch day, it shot up to number one on the Steam sales charts, surpassing heavyweights like Counter-Strike 2 and Apex Legends. It sits in 5th place as of November 1, just behind Cyberpunk 2077. The publisher, Snail Games, revealed that ARK: Survival Ascended has also been very popular on YouTube where it was the number one live game on the site.\n\n\nA similar situation unfolded on Twitch. On launch day, fans watched over 5.6 million minutes of the game, which equates to a whopping 10.7 years. It was also among the top 6 games on the site, gathering  129K concurrent viewers on launch day. \n\n\nUnfortunately, console players will have to wait a while before they can play. This is because critical issues in the multiplayer version were identified, and they would have major implications for the console versions of the games. Consequently, the ports have been delayed to November. \n\n\nARK: Survival Ascended is a remake of the popular 2017 game ARK: Survival Evolved. If you're looking for a survival video game filled with prehistoric animals, this is the franchise you need. \n\nThe post ARK: Survival Ascended had some impressive launch day numbers appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, Tamriel Rebuilt is something else; the combination of fan commitment, and now the project has just released another expansion.\n\n\nCalled \"Andaram,\" this latest update adds even more to the ambitious TES3 mod. A trailer on YouTube gives a taste of what's been added, and details say the new area features, \"over 100 quests and 9 faction questlines, including a new vampire clan and the highly anticipated Andothren Thieves Guild.\"\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the website, this represents the seventh major expansion for the project, which this area being located by the Thirr River.\n\n\nSo what is Tamriel Rebuilt, exactly?\n\n\nGenerally regarded as the smallest game in the base Elder Scrolls entries, Morrowind only really incorporates the island of Vvardenfell, ignoring the rest of the mainland.\n\n\nIt's a bit like if you were to make a game that was set in the United Kingdom, but only mapped out Ireland. What Tamriel Rebuilt does is add in the Elder Scrolls equivalent of England, Wales, and Scotland. At least, that's my take on it.\n\n\nThe fan project technically began before Morrowind was officially released and has been in development ever since. According to the Wiki, around half of the mainland is now playable, and more is being worked on all the time.\n\n\nThe mod is free to download and try, which makes me wonder why I haven't played it myself yet.

Developer Lilith Walther, who goes by b0tster on Twitter, and the team at Fan Software pulled out the, erm, stops on this one. The game will feature 12 racers to choose from and 16 maps on which to race. It comes with a story mode for solo play, as well as a Battle mode and split-screen multiplayer. And since this is, naturally, based on a From Software game, it includes boss battles. How the latter all works isn't all the much of a mystery. As showcased before, the boss battles are one-on-one arena showdowns with deadly weapons. \n\n\n\n\nBloodborne Kart is a joke game no more\n\n\nThe developer also released a new trailer, as seen above. It offers a glimpse of some of the marketable features, such as the playable characters. Want to know who will win in a race between Maria and Baby Mergo? Well, Bloodborne Kart will provide you with the answer to that fan fiction born of a fever dream. My money is on Mergo, though. You see the child whip out that pistol during the trailer? This kid isn't playing. The game's creators certainly do appear to be having a good time. I have nothing but respect for that unabashed homage to Akira. \n\n\nImage via Fan Software\n\n\nSince it's a fan-made game, you should expect it to go easy on your wallet. The developer also released a Bloodborne demake called Bloodborne PSX and uploaded it for free on ichio.

Steelkrill's previous titles are known for their uniquely creepy art-style, and it looks like Rotten Flesh will be no different as it features PSX-style graphics and gameplay.\n\n\n\n\nROY!\n\n\nRotten Flesh is an immersive cosmic horror survival game where the player has just lost their dog Roy. While trying to find Roy, players will have to shout \"ROY!\" in their microphone. As you venture deep into the sewers to search for Roy, calling for him will cause him to bark if he's nearby...but Roy isn't the only creature in the tunnels of the sewers who can respond to your calls. According to the release, players can  opt to toggle off the microphone input and instead switch to voice acting where players can push a button to call for Roy, but the microphone input is recommended.\n\n\nI have to admit, it sounds like a pretty interesting concept, and utilizing the microphone can definitely setup some eerie moments, especially if something other than Roy responds to you calling out. It's great they've made the microphone input optional. But in a game like this, I feel like it will really enhance the experience.\n\n\nIn terms of the rest of the gameplay, it looks like players will be tasked with solving puzzles, hiding and stealthing past enemies, and managing their inventory as they find supplies, upgrades and health packs to survive the depths of the sewers.\n\n\nRotten Flesh does not yet have a release date, but can be wishlisted on Steam.\n\nThe post Horror game developer Steelkrill announces PSX-style cosmic horror game Rotten Flesh appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes a few older Assassin's Creed games on platforms like PC and Xbox 360, as well as Trials Evolution's PC servers.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time Ubisoft has elected to end online services for some of their older games. Although some may be displeased by it, eventually shutting down online services for older entries is common in the gaming industry.\n\n\nThe services are set to shut down early next year, on January 25, 2024 to be exact. Many noticed the abundance of big name franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Here are the 10 games players will no longer have online access to from Ubisoft.\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed 2 - Xbox 360\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood - Mac\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Liberation HD - PS3, Xbox 360\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Revelations - PC\n\n\nGhost Recon Future Soldier - PC\n\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic 6 - PC\n\n\nNCIS - PC\n\n\nR.U.S.E - PC\n\n\nSplinter Cell: Conviction - Xbox 360\n\n\nTrials Evolution - PC\n\n\n\nAssassin’s Creed’s multiplayer legacy\n\n\nDuring the prime of older Assassin’s Creed entries, online multiplayer was a huge staple  in the franchise. Some of the beloved modes that fans of the franchise used to enjoy included PvP modes that allowed players to hash it out in intense stealth battles. There were even a number of different scenarios that could accompany these modes.\n\n\nBut, in newer entries, it is evident that the multiplayer aspect has become much less prominent. Some games, such as Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Assassin’s Creed Mirage, have completely discarded the multiplayer component that older entries once leaned on.\n\n\nAlthough these games will no longer be available for online services, players will still have great memories of them.\n\nThe post Ubisoft shutting down online services for 10 older games, including 4 Assassin’s Creed entries appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While I wasn’t looking, the King’s Field-inspired RPG, Lunacid has exited Early Access and launched its full version. This happened yesterday, October 30, 2023.\n\n\nWhy doesn’t Steam tell me these things? The game is in my Steam library. Does Steam think I don’t want to know when an Early Access game I own updates to its full 1.0 version? An email would be nice.\n\n\nRude, uncommunicative storefront aside, Lunacid is a first-person RPG dungeon crawler inspired by FromSoftware’s 1994 PS1 title, King’s Field. King’s Field is considered the spiritual precursor to Demon’s Souls and its follow-ups. Since we haven’t seen even a hint of a re-release, the formula and aesthetic is getting picked up by indie developers, and Lunacid is an early example of it.\n\n\nI’m not sure how to describe it. King’s Field is more of a vibe than anything. A gritty, gloomy,  claustrophobic dungeon crawler with a hint of unknowable horror. While Demon’s Souls borrowed that vibe, King’s Field (and, by extension, Lunacid) is not a soulslike game. They’re more focused on exploration than intricate combat.\n\n\nDeveloped by Kira, it entered Early Access in March 2022, and was gradually built up from there. Lunacid is an excellent title in its own right. Don’t take my word for it. It currently has the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam. The developer seems like a cool, cool person. They have promised more bug fixes in the future and have teased that they are working on a prequel.\n\n\nLunacid is now available on PC.\n\nThe post King’s Field-inspired Lunacid has released out of Early Access appeared first on Destructoid.",

This time the mystery is swirling around Konoehara Academy, which has been host to a grim shroud since the first in a series of students disappeared. Yashiki has to pose as a teacher and search for any lingering clues as to the whereabouts of these missing students. A handful of side characters — including returning faces from Spirit Hunter: Death Mark— can assist in new 2D side-scrolling exploration sections. \n\n\nThe official website is live now along with the Steam page for Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II. There's also a 14-track original soundtrack CD available for anyone who picks it up through the North American Aksys Online Store. You can see a sample of the new perspectives and more in the First Look trailer. \n\n\nScreenshot via Aksys Games\n\n\nStill on the hunt\n\n\nThe series comes from Experience, the developers behind dungeon-crawlers like Demon Gaze and Stranger of Sword City. It kicked off with Spirit Hunter: Death Mark in 2017, with Spirit Hunter: NG following close behind in 2018. \n\n\nSpirit Hunter: Death Mark II was initially crowdfunded through Campfire, managing to more than double its goal for a total of over 30 million yen. We'll see how its new 2D sections and \"Suspensive Acts\" — which have you making choices under pressure — play out early next year. \n\nThe post Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II launches more haunting investigations on February 15, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While PC and PlayStation 5 owners are off adventuring, there's a large faction of players still awaiting the Baldur's Gate 3 Xbox Series X|S release. Larian Studios previously stated that it should be rolling out this year, but we've yet to hear anything definitive. \n\n\nToday, Larian's CEO Swen Vincke emerged to squelch any fears that may be growing from the Xbox fanbase.  Via Twitter/X, he confirmed that the title is being \"actively playtested\" and remains on schedule for 2023.\n\n\n\n\nIt was back in August that Vincke confirmed the game was still slated to make a 2023 release. However, the game would not make the same release window as the PlayStation 5 version as compromises (the cutting of split-screen coop) had to be made on the Xbox Series S version of the hit RPG. \n\n\nTo that point, it appeared as though keeping parity across Xbox Series S and X was creating issues, as some have reported in the past. But when Baldur's Gate 3 became a smashing success on PC, Gaming CEO Phil Spencer decided that perhaps complete similarities across the Series X and Series S versions of titles weren't entirely necessary. \n\n\nWith that, the Baldur's Gate 3 Xbox release is slated for late 2023. And since Larian's CEO confirming things are going well, Xbox players should be able to get their hands on the highly reviewed RPG at some point in the next couple of months.\n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 Xbox release is ‘still on schedule’ for this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Atari states that Digital Eclipse benefits by gaining access to “world-class IP” to grow its business and development capabilities further. \nAtari is spending $6.5 million on the acquisition ($4 million in cash, $2.5 million in newly issued Atari shares), with a remaining earn-out of up to $13.5 million in cash over the next 10…",

This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. \n\n\nWith Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer \"whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters,\" according to a new statement released. \nYou can read Fox's full statement below: \nElsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, \"I already feel very confident about how we can progress.\" They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. \nFor more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer's Undertale review. \nAre you going to purchase Deltarune with the release of Chapter 4? Let us know in the comments below!",

Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. \nIn the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. \nCheck out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSquare Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.\nKingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. \nFor more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes\nWhen host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.\nYou can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). \n\n\nWhether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.\nBeyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5.

For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as \"Monster Baby\". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.\n\n\nUnlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology.

But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.\nStrangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.\n#TheBatman suit is available for #ArkhamKnight via the Epic Games store\n@Venturian628) pic.twitter.com/pdTMYoNvWe\nOctober 26, 2023\nAt first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. \nThe Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. \nWhile we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight.

A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. \n\n\nVersion 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: \nAddressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed\nAddressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions\nAddressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright\nImproved stability\nDeveloper Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. \n\"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,\" it reads. \"We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error.

The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.\nAt the time, \"The Avenger Initiative\" felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. \nA new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.\nThe open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. \n\n\nPlayers will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. \nThe open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.",

In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.\nWhile what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the \"first in-engine look.\" Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a \"pre-alpha footage\" tag.\nCheck out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. \nRevealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. \nHere are a few screenshots from today's showing: \n\nFor more Metal Gear, check out Game Informer's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 PlayStation 5 New Gameplay Today. \nAre you excited for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater?

A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.\nThe Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.\nNonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.",

Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. \nSome images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, \"Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.\"\nHey, @PlayStation & @cerny, we need to talk!\nhttps://t.co/GacpULuDu0 pic.twitter.com/IIF1iB2zgV\nOctober 25, 2023\nUnderstandably, many players and video game preservationists aren't enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it's unclear if it's required after that. \nGame Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. \nThe same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.\nFor more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won't come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.\nWhat do you think about this disc drive requiring an internet connection?

It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. \nStar Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
