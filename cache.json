          "description": "In bird culture, this is considered a Jack Move.\nIt feels like most JRPGs these days don’t really tread much into hard science fiction. Sure, big franchises like Final Fantasy or Xenoblade aren’t afraid to mix in some tech alongside their magic, but it’s rare that you’ll see developers fully commit to a world that’s all robots and computers. In this regard, Jack Move is a breath of fresh air. What we have here is a brief, well-paced, and thoroughly traditional JRPG set in a cyberpunk universe. It's surprisingly innovative and a delight to play through.\nJack Move takes place in a near-future, cyberpunk society where governments are effectively impotent and enormous conglomerates reign supreme. You take on the role of Noa, a chipper hacker who routinely participates in attacks on corporations and sells sensitive information on the black market. Noa and her partner-in-crime, Ryder, are simply carrying on with business as usual when she receives a message from her estranged father, who warns her that a corporation called Monomind may be after her because of something he’s been working on. Shortly after this, Monomind kidnaps her dad, starting Noa and Ryder on a quest to free him and get to the bottom of his latest research project.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, it's sometimes difficult to muster much excitement for these annual instalments, and it's easy to dismiss them as just another incremental update that looks and plays almost identically to the previous season's effort. However, NBA 2K23 is worth getting a little more jazzed about than usual, as it combines an excellent new Michael Jordan Challenge mode with, what we reckon, is the best on-court action we've seen from the series thus far, even if this Switch port has had to make some cuts here and there.\nLet's kick things off with that new Michael Jordan Challenge mode, which feels like a fully fleshed-out and richly rewarding part of the game. Here you'll take part in 15 specific challenges based on events from across MJ's career, with each and every one of them presented in exacting detail, featuring era-specific stadiums, kits, commentary and screen filters that give the whole thing a delightfully aged look. This is no throwaway mode, it's a full-on history lesson to sink your teeth into that really brings MJ's early career and biggest NBA moments back to life.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Thankfully some modders have stepped in to fill the void. There's now a publicly playable beta of Half-Life 2: VR Mod available on Steam that makes the nearly 20-year-old shooter playable with a headset and motion controllers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…\nRead more",

Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.\nIndeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time. \nRead more",

Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground.

          "description": "Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. \nIt doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping. \nRead more",

          "description": "Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. \"Let me in!!\" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. \"I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!\"\nIf you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.\nRead more",

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about. \nRead more",

The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. \nIt's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something. \nRead more",

          "description": "As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin's Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It's not going to be quite the massive open world adventure 'em up that the last few entries have been (don't worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series' 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin's Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.\nRead more",

To celebrate the doughty action-adventure's 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny \"it's the Daddy\" Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin's Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series.

Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin's Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight's Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused.

The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September. \nRead more",

          "description": "The Secret Garden\nThis week's Arcade Archives entry from Hamster is in keeping with the week's ongoing theme of farming/gardening titles, though this one provides a little added spookiness — Namco's maze chaser Rompers is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to arcades in 1989 and designed by Splatterhouse creator Akira Usukura, Rompers is a maze-chasing title that sees a young farmer on a quest to rescue his girlfriend from the clutches of an army of monsters and ghoulies. Our hero, \"Chap,\" must negotiate a series of garden mazes, gathering a total of 61 keys to unlock what must be the biggest door in human history and free his gal from her floral prison.\nYou can check out the action in the trailer below, courtesy of YouTuber crazyclimber80.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhXW4HJoNbg\nBeing chased by dinosaurs, wolves, jellied blobs, a cigarette-smoking... thing, and even a cute, unkillable lady vampire named Tsukaima, Chap's only defense is the ability to push walls to block or crush his opponents (though defeated enemies will return after a short period of downtime). After battling his way through each maze, Chap will come face to face with his lady's captor, the mad scientist Gurerin. Like a lot of maze-chaser titles, short intermission sequences features cute cartoon cutscenes starring the game's characters.\nRompers would not receive a home port, but did feature in several Namco compilations and was made available on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan. This new release represents one of the very few occasions in which the title has been made officially available outside of Japan.\nRompers is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Save the girl and ruin a garden in Arcade Archives’ Rompers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Squeaky Clean\nFun news for everybody who likes to keep things in ship shape — Square Enix Collective has announced that FuturLab ultra-satisfying... shooter(?) PowerWash Simulator is currently preparing to make the world a shinier place on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch platforms. A release date was not announced.\nLaunching on PC in 2021, before making the leap to Xbox earlier this year, PowerWash Simulator tasks players with restoring homes, vehicles, workplaces, and all manner of locales to their former glory, blasting away dirt, grease, and grime with the aid of some supremely soothing jet-wash gear. PowerWash Simulator can be played as a stress-free cleaning sim, or players can choose to add a variety of challenges — such as time limits and finite resources — in order to up the antiseptic ante.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoGFZlt4Egw\nPlayers can customize the look of their equipment, and each switch out tools and attachments to deal with those particularly stubborn stains. Don't want to wash alone, then invite along a buddy for some relaxing co-op cleaning action. PowerWash Simulator might have one of gaming's simplest premises, but it is one that has seemingly resonated with thousands of players, with the title becoming a popular wind-down title for those looking to relax at the end of a hard day or to while away the wee hours of the weekend.\nAfter all, why waste time cleaning your real home when you can just clean a pretend one?\nPowerWash Simulator releases \"soon\" on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.

There are three possible endings, all \"drastically different,\" casting a new light on the main characters as they discover what justice means.\n\nAfter our first stream last Friday, I can confirm Aviary Attorney is very witty and comical.\nI like that the cases have details that matter, lines where you may need to remember some very early clues, and a (sometimes frustrating) time limit to find them; so it's a fun challenge to remember everything and put the clues to use.

Now this handy Nintendo infographic provides a full picture of what's to come with 2022 Switch games into 2023.\nThe updated infographic comes straight from Nintendo's Twitter account, which leads off with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, then very smoothly leads with first-party games. We have Pikmin 4 finally confirmed for 2023, as well as a new Fire Emblem and a Kirby remaster. The recently-released Splatoon 3 and the Xenoblade Chronicles 3/Mario Kart 8 Deluxe season passes are included too. In the near future for first-party 2022 Switch games, Bayonetta 3 and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope are arriving in October, with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet ending the year in November with what will certainly be a big splash, sales-wise.\nThird parties aren't left out either, as several Switch ports are given time to shine (like It Takes Two, Sifu, and Tunic), mixed in with remakes like Front Mission 1st and Front Mission 2. You can check everything out in the image below, or watch the Direct for yourself.

          "description": "Current gen titles to sport top-tier prices\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that the publisher is to adopt a $70 USD price tag for all of its major releases going forward. The new price point, which is fast becoming industry standard, will be applicable to all of the publisher's \"AAA\" titles.\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Axios, Guillemot noted that the price change was in-line with other publishers in the industry that have also decided to add a further $10 to the Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of their biggest releases, particularly for current platforms such as PS5 and Xbox Series X. The first Ubisoft title to release at the new price will be the current-gen edition of Skull & Bones — scheduled to launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X in November. Future releases such as the upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage are also expected to adopt the new pricing scheme.\nWhile many will understandably groan at the inevitable price hike, Ubisoft is by far the first publisher to take this step, and is in fact one of the few outliers in this particular situation. 2K Games' NBA 2K20 was the first title to launch at $70 back in 2020. Other publishers, such as Activision, Sony, and Square Enix, would follow suit — putting out premium titles such as Returnal and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, even on the traditionally \"cheaper\" PC platform.

One of them is Dreamlight Valley, Disney's answer to the Stardew Valley-inspired craze. In the game, you play as a character who finds themselves in a magical land in ruins after an event known as \"The Forgetting\" — which is just as ominous as it sounds. Players are tasked with ridding the land of the insidious night thorns, as well as doing the usual fare for these kinds of games: farming, fishing, cooking, mining, digging, and filling requests for the townspeople (who also happen to be beloved Disney characters).\nThe siren song of another cozy simulator game is enough to draw out gamers in droves, but add on the juggernaut that is the Disney brand? Yeah, it's no surprise that this game is seeing the success that it is. So much success, in fact, that Dreamlight Valley has managed to accrue over a million players only ten short days after its release.\n\nDreamlight Valley was developed by Gameloft, which has been notable in the mobile market for decades. This certainly isn't their first wider release for consoles, but I think it's fair to say that this is the studio's most notable release so far.\nI'd consider myself to be a casual Disney fan, but this is a game I certainly can't wait to try for myself. The idea of seeing a bunch of my favorite characters in a game genre I already go out of my way to play as much as possible, well, that's just something I can't resist.\nFrom the classic characters like Mickey and Donald all the way up to new characters like Elsa and Moana, the roster is pretty stacked.

The wacky arena shooter has not only sold over three million copies in its home territory Japan, but has also debuted in the top spot of the UK Charts.\nThis feat represents the first time that the Splatoon series has held the premier position and, as one of the few major Nintendo franchises not to find itself on the throne, is a particularly notable event. Previous entries Splatoon (2015) and Splatoon 2 (2017) both reached the still impressive No.2 slot, but were held off by CDPR's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Activision's Crash Bandicoot: N.Sane Trilogy, (which long-term readers will remember was a UK No.1 for infinity billion years.)\nSplatoon 3, which launched on Nintendo Switch a mere four days ago, is already proving to be one of Nintendo's best-selling titles of 2022 in the UK, as well as one of the fastest-selling Switch releases ever. Once again, the messy multiplayer release sees teams of players battle it out in turf war-based combat — utilizing an array of ridonkulous weaponry and unique special abilities in order to win the day.\nSplatoon 3 is set against a (slightly) more industrial backdrop than its predecessors — fallout from the final splatfest of Splatoon 2 favoring \"Chaos\" over \"Order.\"\nU.K. video game sales chart w/e: September 10, 2022\n(Chart reflects in-store physical sales only)\n1.

Today's bizarre surprise comes in the form of a VR remake of Taito classic Operation: WOLF, coming to PC and consoles in 2022.\n\nOperation Wolf Returns: First Mission is a reimagining of the legendary 1987 rail shooter, which sees hardy Green Beret Roy Adams embark on a do-or-die mission behind enemy lines to rescue a group of hapless hostages, held captive by some evil force that isn't America. The remake will tweak the characters, locations, and objectives of the coin-op classic, but promises to retain the trigger-pumping, quarter-guzzling action that made the original such a smash over three decades ago.\n\nFirst Mission will feature a one-or-two-player story campaign, a wide arsenal of explosive weaponry, and a frenzied survival mode, alongside new enemies, stages, and cutscenes. No trailer was released for the title but screenshots have been made available for player perusal. I see the soldiers and the helicopters, but as of yet no hapless nurses, cats, or blatant Schwarzenegger rip-offs.

PC and Nintendo Switch are on the docket, and Team Cherry confirmed a few months ago that Silksong is also headed to Xbox Game Pass.\nWith PlayStation's reveal, it now seems like everyone will get a chance to get in on the new Hollow Knight game when it arrives.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1570797280063627264\nThe Game Pass reveal, along with this, is also the latest news we've had on Hollow Knight: Silksong. The long-awaited title is still in development, with no date locked in quite yet.\nAll that being said, though, the sleek needle-and-thread action of Silksong has looked pretty great in every showing. Here's the latest trailer, as an example.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSfuFlhsxZY\nGood things for those who wait\nIt's hopefully not too much longer before we get some official details on Silksong's debut. Considering how much folks loved the original Hollow Knight, it's got some big shoes to fill.\nOf course, there have been some quite solid action exploration games, or Metroidvanias, in the gap between. Last year's Axiom Verge 2, a sequel to the excellent Axiom Verge, springs to mind.\nFans really want the dark hollows and armored bugs, though, ever since its reveal as a fully-fledged follow-up in 2019.\nHollow Knight: Silksong is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox, PC, and Switch sometime in the future.\nThe post Hollow Knight: Silksong adds PS4 and PS5 to its target platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Praise the lord and pass the ammunition\nLike any genre, lo-fi horror carries with it the possibility of growing stale. You can only be locked in a house with a killer so many times before it’s routine. It’s not always that way, however. There are lots of alternatives. Night at the Gates of Hell makes a big detour for the genre by empowering you with a gun. The zombies are slow, and ammo is limited. Aim for the head.\nIt certainly helps that it marks the return of the duo that created Bloodwash, which still stands as one of my favorite examples of the genre. Jordan King and Henry Hoare have returned with some extra ammunition, this time giving us all the zombies we can handle. It’s a rather stark departure from Bloodwash’s thick and heavy suspense, but it’s substantial proof that these two k…",

It's due out in 2023, and will pack in both games under the \"Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars\" moniker.\nAs for what's actually remastered, Konami touts \"HD background illustrations, updated pixel art, new environmental sound effects, an auto-save feature, a battle fast-forward mechanic, a conversation log, and extra HD battle effects.\" The trailer also shows that moving diagonally is possible. This might excite some hardcore fans, too: \"All character portraits have been updated in HD. Junko Kawano, who designed the characters for the original version of Suikoden released in 1995, has newly re-drawn all the character portraits for Suikoden I HD Remaster Gate Rune War.\"\nThis is seemingly the reveal that Konami had teased for TGS from a storied franchise. It actually has a Steam page up now if you want to peruse some more info. I mean, while this isn't huge news to some, it's great news for Suikoden fans. Not only do they have another cheaper option to play these two Suikoden games, but there's also the whole Eiyuden Chronicle spiritual successor series, which currently has one released game and another one planned.\nSadly, the rest of the Konami TGS presentation was filled with a sleepy series of Yu-Gi-Oh presentations, as well as brief looks at Super Bomberman R 2, Cygni: All Guns Blazing (a shmup they showed off a few weeks ago), and eFootball (the series formerly known as Pro Evolution Soccer, or PES).

Yes, limited time means limited time, as you'll get a little over a week to play the demo. The open testing period begins now, and will run through September 25: at that point access to the demo will be pulled. Also, as is customary, you can earn a bonus item for the full game after completing the demo. In this case, it's an item called the \"Crouching Dragon Helmet.\"\nHere's a rundown of the Wo Long demo from Koei Tecmo: \"The demo version of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, an action RPG set in a dark fantasy Three Kingdoms world. As a nameless militia soldier in the chaotic Three Kingdoms world, the player will face demons and officers using swordplay based on Chinese martial arts. By clearing this demo version, players will be able to obtain a Crouching Dragon Helmet that can be used in the retail version.\"\nFollowing the demo, in classic Team Ninja fashion, there's also going to be an online survey to tell the team what you think. They always make changes for future demos and the full version based on these surveys, so make it count.

That's a whole lot of beautiful space pixels to blast into your eyes.\nIf you own the game on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One already, you can upgrade within your respective console family at no cost. Just use your respective digital storefront, either PlayStation or Xbox, to bump it up.\nOtherwise, Outer Wilds is currently available for $24.99, with the Echoes of the Eye DLC running $14.99, or $39.99 for a bundled package.

          "description": "Still due out in 2023\nThanks to a new Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty dev diary TGS trailer, we have a better look at how Team Ninja is approaching this \"masocore\" (their words) action game.\nFumihiko Yasuda (producer) speaks on how when he was pondering the future of the Nioh series, he \"started to consider a worldview separate from Sengoku-era Japan,\" and drew upon his personal love of the stories of the Three Kingdoms era. A story \"based around Chinese martial arts\" was a good fit to convey this idea, and was a perfect way to differentiate a new project from Nioh.\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty will portray the \"turbulence\" of the era, with a heavy focus on the concept of the \"dark world,\" which will likely aim for a baseline intense experience. The \"fluidity of speed\" is a goal for the combat system, and we get to see a brief look at the upcoming character creation menu. Variation between players in an online setting was used as one reason for avatar customization, as well as a focus on a \"historical story,\" rather than a personal one.\nTeam Ninja is busy, as they also have Rise of the Ronin in the works, which also has Yasuda involved as a director (though we'll have to understandably wait until 2024 for that one). As someone who watched Team Ninja walk, then run, then falter, I'm just glad they're back in the mix again.\nAt this point with several recent universally-liked projects under their belt, new announcements are met with glee rather than a groan. There was a rough patch there capped off by Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, but they really counterbalanced that with Hyrule Warriors that same year, into reestablishing dominance with Nioh three years later.\nThe Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty TGS trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPDI4ehuA38\nThe post Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks better every time I see it, including this TGS showing appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You've got until September 21\nAs we inch closer and closer to the looming 1.0 launch of Vampire Survivors, fans are getting antsy, myself included. Today's morsel is just a \"minor patch,\" but there's important news for folks on the sidelines: a price increase is coming soon.\nAt just three dollars, Vampire Survivors is some of the best bang-for-your-buck gaming I've ever experienced. And while typically Early Access titles wait until their full launch to raise prices, in this case, the game will cost more starting on September 21. The 1.0 launch is coming later — we'll learn the full release date in two weeks, on September 29.\nThe creator, poncle, explained this choice. \"To be frank, it's because otherwise I'd mess up the sales calendar for the rest of the year. I want to keep the option open to eventually enter some of the usual seasonal sales, and increasing the price on v1.0 launch day would mess up the timings, as price changes also comes with a temporary price freeze.\"\nPlayers have become so absorbed with the game's monster-exploding grind and fun unlockables that they've actually asked — sometimes jokingly, but often for real — for Vampire Survivors to charge more. I got my money's worth early on, and the updates just kept coming. I'm now at 55 hours on the clock. It's baffling when I stop and think about it.\nToday's patch is a minor one\nSo, what's new in patch 0.11.3? Most notably, I'd point to Blood Astronomia (Arcana XXI), which emits \"special damaging zones affected by Amount and Magnet\" for weapons like Garlic and Song of Mana. There's also the MissingNo character, who has randomized stats and can now be \"unlocked officially\" — find the full instructions here on Reddit.\nIf you've thought about getting into Vampire Survivors, consider this your call to do so before the price jumps. I can easily see it hitting the $10-$15 range.\nThe post It’s time to get Vampire Survivors before its price increases appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The wait is finally over\nThis has been a pretty awesome year for indie games, with titles like Cult of the Lamb, Immortality, and We Are OFK, just to name a few. One game has stuck with me since I reviewed it all the way back in March, and still remains one of my favorites to come out in 2022: the Southern Gothic narrative adventure NORCO that was \"inspired by first-person pixel noirs like Déjà Vu & Snatcher and rooted in years of research,\" according to the game's creators. Set in a dystopian cyberpunk version of New Orleans, Louisiana, the game takes you on a journey through the infamous \"Cancer Alley,\" an area of Mississippi that accounts for a quarter of the US's petrochemical production.\nNow, the game's developer Geography of Robots has announced that NORCO is finally coming to consoles with a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One release on October 20. You can also play on Xbox Games Pass, if that suits your fancy. I obviously own NORCO on PC already, but I'm super excited for this release, because it means the game will be accessible to more players — and this game deserves all the hype it can get, if getting hype for old-school point-and-clicks is your thing.\nhttps://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1570188618647437312\nA press release from publisher Raw Fury provides more in-depth details on the game:\n\"NORCO is the debut title from developer collective Geography of Robots. Lead creator Yuts was born and raised in Norco, Louisiana, an acronym for New Orleans Refining Co., located in the so-called 'Cancer Alley,' a stretch of the Mississippi that accounts for 1/4 of the US's petrochemical production. The game blends real locations, personal stories, and Southern Gothic literature with a captivating original soundtrack featuring a guest track by Southern metal Band THOU.\"\nIf you're at all interested in checking NORCO out on your favorite console, I can't recommend it enough!\nThe post Southern gothic narrative adventure NORCO is coming to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, I’m excited to see how the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, which we now know is called Tears of the Kingdom, will innovate on the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor, but even moreso, I’m pumped to see how the story of the world has changed since we last checked in with the Hylian hero.\nWhen people ask me what my favorite video game stories are, they’re usually confused to hear that I add Breath of the Wild to that list.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake.

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees.

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

However, he's seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today's Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. \nCheck it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nAs you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024's Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023. \nFor more, read about today's Like A Dragon 8 reveal and then check out this story about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a 2014 Yakuza spin-off finally coming to the West next year.",

That's why it's no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nAs you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. \nLike A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. \nIn the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.",

Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.\nNow that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo's digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online's Expansion Pack? Maybe you're super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?\nOr was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can't talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.\nLet us know in the comments below what you're most hyped about coming out of today's Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play.

          "description": "Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!",

The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.\n\nUnfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won't hit PlayStation 5 until 2024. \nAre you excited for Rise of Ronin?

However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. \n\n\nAs the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. \n“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”\nFae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.",

On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.\nUp to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor's Tome Trackers.\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023.

          "description": "I can't believe I'm writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it's out next year. \nLet's get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: \n\n\nHere's what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today's reveal: \n \nPikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.\"\n\n \nPikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. \nPikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and \"very close to completion.\" Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that \"it is progressing,\" seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!\n\nNintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out! \nAre you excited for Pikmin 4?

All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.\"\nPreoders for the Switch version begin today.",

CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. \nDuring the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. \n\n\n\"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,\" Nowakowski said during the call. \"Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future.\" \nAs for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. \nIn the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow should CDPR further develop its Cyberpunk IP?

While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. \nWe already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that \"Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.\" \nIn 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn't, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, \"In terms of pricing, we've been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.\" Today's Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.\nUbisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It's worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin's Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.\nYou can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft's troubled workplace culture, the company's current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint's integration of them, and plenty more here.",
