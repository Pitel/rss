          "description": "You will not survive.\nWrath: Aeon of Ruin has been a long time coming. Running on a heavily modified version of the Quake engine and developed by some of the Quake scene’s most skilled modders, Wrath looked set to take over the retro shooter world when it hit Early Access in 2019. Then it was hit with delay after delay, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2022 release date slipped to 2023, then 2024.\nAnd now, finally, Wrath is here. And upon playing it, we understand why it took developer KillPixel so long to finish it, for both better and worse. What’s here is good, but Wrath often feels like it’s struggling under the weight of its own ambition and the limitations of being on a console - and no, we're not just talking about the Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

According to the research, leadership at Vicarious Visions had wanted to collaborate more closely with Nintendo after the studio's work on Skylanders: Superchargers (which, if you remember, included the likes of Bowser and Donkey Kong on Wii U, Wii, and 3DS).

Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.\nHades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.\nRead more",

          "description": "Crossover fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite first sauntered onto various videogaming mechanisms back in 2017. We forgot to review it. Oops. But others did, sometimes complaining about the art style, which was a chunky and plastic-looking departure from previous games in the series. It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity. A fighting game modder has been tinkering with shaders to bring the comic book style of previous games to Infinite. Looks cool.\nRead more",

          "description": "Medieval city builder Manor Lords was Steam's most-wishlisted game prior to release, and has now managed the feat of transmuting that anticipation into broad enthusiasm and very healthy sales. Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.\nStyczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Remember that bit in that Guy Ritchie film where Dexter Fletcher shoot a guy and then throws a glowing jar over his soldier that summons a bunch of skeletons to help him out? Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

Step forward Mini Settlers, which has a free prologue version you might try if you're weary of Manor Lording, or you've already exhausted the play possibilities of early access Franconia.\nRead more",

I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section.

It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as \"a cross between a game and a stop motion film\", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.\nI love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.\nRead more",

The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of \"in the fall\". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). \nBefore that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) \"a big update that's coming really soon\", and that \"we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff.\" This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year. \nRead more",

          "description": "The Warzone Season 3 update added a Champions Quest contract to Rebirth Island. The contract works similarly to how it does on Urzikstan, but there are a few significant differences that need explaining. Here is everything you need to know about getting a nuke in a Resurgence match. \n\n\nHow to get a nuke on Rebirth Island in Warzone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin five consecutive matches in Resurgence or standard battle royale\n\n\nPick up the Champions Quest contract, which is marked by a parachute with a star in the middle\n\n\nAcquire all four elements\n\n\nConstruct the bomb\n\n\nDefend the bombsite until it goes off\n\n\n\nAfter picking up the Champions Quest contract, squads have 10 minutes to collect all three elements. Each element drops after an 11-minute timer, but kills, contracts, buy station purchases, and chests reduce the time. The fastest way to reduce the timer is to purchase items at a buy station. Players can also use the unidentified phone item which is located in the Headquarters POI vault after using the Biometric Scanner 27 days in a row. The phone gives you $500 to $1000 every 30 seconds, which also lowers the nuke timer by up to 11 seconds every 30 seconds. \n\n\nAfter collecting all three elements, the bomb drops from the sky, and the squad must insert all of the elements. After that, the nuke gets armed, and a two-minute detonation timer starts. If players complete the detonation process without an enemy defusing the bomb, the match ends, and the squad successfully completes the Resurgence Champions Quest.\n\n\nResurgence Champions Quest rewards\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are all of the rewards for completing the Resurgence Champions Quest contract.\n\n\n\nEngine Light’s On Weapon Camo\n\n\nMaterial Handler Unique Operator Skin\n\n\nChampion Banner Animated Calling Card \n\n\nMaster Procrastinator Weapon Charm\n\n\nAlpha Particles Weapon Sticker \n\n\nThe post How to get a nuke in Warzone Resurgence appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After emerging as one of Warzone's best close-range meta weapons, Raven Software nerfed the DG-58 LSW. In its absence, the MCW JAK Raven Kit checks off every box for what you want from a replacement. \n\n\nThe Season 3 Reloaded update buffed and nerfed several weapons that needed to be slightly tweaked. However, the devs surprisingly didn't touch the DG-58 LSW. According to data provided by TrueGameData, the DG-58 LSW JAK Nightshade Kit had a significantly faster time-to-kill speed than all close-range meta weapons for gunfights between 0 and 20 meters. \n\n\nImage via Activision \n\n\nRaven Software didn't let that discrepancy slide for too long. The JAK Nightshade's damage values, max damage range, and headshot multiplier were nerfed into the ground. As a result, players needed to find a new weapon to use in short-range engagements. The WSP-9 leads all weapons by a wide margin with a 30 percent pick rate, according to WZ Ranked, but the second most popular weapon is what grabs our attention. \n\n\nTrueGameData crunched the numbers and determined that the nerf should knock the DG-58 LSW out of contention because of a smaller magazine size, damage per mag, and poor mobility. The MCW Jak Raven Kit boasts impressive ADS speeds, accuracy, and similar damage, making it a compelling choice. Check out our MCW loadout guide to know which attachments to use for this weapon. \n\nThe post MCW JAK Raven kit takes over Warzone meta after DG-58 LSW nerf appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Warframe's late game is centered around acquiring everything you can to increase your Mastery, and Prime items make up the bulk of that Mastery. To snag Prime items, you need to get their parts from Void Relics, meaning it's this endless cycle of acquiring Void Relics, leveling them up using Void Traces, then hoping to god it's the reward you want. Farming those Void Relics as quickly as possible helps move this process along. Here's where to farm Axi Relics in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to get Axi Relics in Warframe\n\n\nWhen it comes to farming Axi Relics in Warframe, three places are good depending on your situation. These locations are Tyana Pass on Mars, Hydron on Sedna, and Circulus on Lua. The first two are dependent on a few conditions, where Circulus is the most consistent. All three locations require you to reach the Rotation C reward to get a chance at an Axi Relic. This means you need to survive until the fourth major loot drop.\n\n\nAs for the first two options, Tyana Pass is good if you have yet to get Citrine or any assorted items you can get while farming the Mirror Defense mission. People tend to run this for a while, but it can be a little tedious after a while collecting all the Belric and Rania Crystals. Meanwhile, Hydron on Sedna is good if you have some items you've been wanting to level up for a while now. You need to reach 20 waves to get a chance at an Axi Relic so I wouldn't bring fully unleveled gear, but one or two items should be fine.\n\n\nOtherwise, people heavily farm Circulus thanks to getting a ton of Lua Thrax Plasm and the ability to get Voruna. This means most random groups should end up farming the full 20 minutes needed. However, it's also the hardest of the three due to having the highest base enemy level of all three missions. Be sure to proceed with caution.\n\nThe post Where to farm Axi Relics in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Season 3 Reloaded brought back the iconic Akimbo Model 1887s, and years later, the shotguns pack the same hefty punch. \n\n\nAfter the mid-season update, Modern Warfare 3 got a new short-range meta contender. The JAK Wardens Conversion Kit transforms the Lockwood MK2 into Akimbo shotguns. Players must complete the Week 5 challenges to unlock this unique attachment and reach the maximum level on the Lockwood MK2. With the Conversion Kit equipped, the battle rifle would have the best sprint speed among MW3 shotguns, and a sprint to fire time of 35 milliseconds. TheXclusiveAce tested every MW3 shotgun and the average speed was 224 miliseconds. \n\n\nIn addition, shotguns have a one-shot kill range of 29 meters when both weapons are fired simultaneously. Players should be able to effortlessly take down enemies relatively far away, making this weapon one of the best options in Season 3 Reloaded. Let's jump right into which attachments work best. \n\n\nBest Lockwood MK2 loadout in MW3\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nMuzzle: Crown Breaker Choke\n\n\nLaser: Verdant Hook Cylindrical laser \n\n\nConversion Kit: JAK Wardens \n\n\n\nOur loadout focuses on getting the tightest possible hipfire spread because you aren't able to aim down sights while using Akimbo weapons. The Crown Breaker Choke improves hipfire spread min by 100 percent and tactical stance spread by a good chunk at the small cost of recoil and ADS speed. Meanwhile, the Verdant Hook Cylindrical Laser helps sprint to fire speed, close-quarter accuracy while sliding, and hipfire and tac spread. You don't have too many options as the conversion kit restricts players from equipping a barrel, underbarrel, guard, comb, stock, or lever. \n\n\nIf you are a fan of shotguns, there are no better options than the JAK Wardens. 29 meters is an exceptional one-shot kill range, and players will have no problems with this weapon's accuracy. \n\nThe post The best Lockwood MK2 loadout in MW3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Even if you’re not yet playing Hades 2 via Early Access, you can get in on the experience by way of your earholes. Supergiant Games has uploaded the entire soundtrack to YouTube so you can get a listen.\n\n\nI’ve been playing Hades 2 for the past week or so. I’m not sure how much I should give away, but suffice it to say, there’s a song in there that you experience on every run. It’s called “Coral Crown” and it is quite the earworm. Uncomfortably so, since after I heard that the soundtrack was available, my first response was, “Oh no,” because now I wouldn’t have to play through a run just to get to the spot where the song plays.\n\n\nI’m listening to it now. I’ll probably be listening to it a few times more throughout the day. And then I can guarantee you that it will be echoing around in there for a few days. I already had it stuck in my head, but now it’s going to be louder and I’ll know the lyrics.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Supergiants’ in-house musician, Darren Korb, and it’s another banger. It’s broadly atmospheric and varied. More importantly, it’s extremely listenable outside the context of the game itself. I recommend giving it a try.\n\n\nHades 2 is available now on PC via Early Access. The soundtrack can now be streamed from YouTube.\n\nThe post The Hades 2 soundtrack is available to stick into your ears on YouTube appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Finally, the reign of the HRM-9 as the Warzone meta SMG is over. It's been a while since we had the opportunity to use just about anything else. Now, there are a few options, though most prefer the Striker-9, the  WSP-9 is also viable. It's got mobility, close-range damage, and is shockingly accurate. The recent buffs it received made it one of the best options. \n\n\nThe WSP-9 received a buff in Call of Duty Warzone\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone recently underwent their midseason 'Reloaded' update for Season 3. With it came a large number of changes to guns, including nerfing the Warzone meta weapons for the last few months. However, the underrated and underutilized WSP-9 also received a small buff, and it's one of the best close-range options in battle royale and Resurgence game modes.\n\n\nAccording to the developer patch notes, the WSP-9's sprint-to-fire time was decreased from 110 ms to 66 ms, a 44% decrease. In other words, you'll be able to pull it up and shoot more quickly than before while on the move. That's exactly what you need in a versatile SMG.\n\n\nHow to build the best WSP-9 loadout for Warzone\n\n\nScreenshot from Destructoid\n\n\nAs for the loadout, it isn't anything out of the ordinary for the WSP-9. Many builds require similar attachments, but the WSP-9 really doesn't need any help with recoil control. Instead, most of these items focus on mobility and damage output, making it excellent in nearly all situations.\n\n\n\nZEHMN35 Compensator Muzzle\n\n\nHISS Short Light Barrel\n\n\nDR-6 Handstop Underbarrel\n\n\n50 Round Magazine\n\n\nJAK Glassless Optic or optic of your choosing\n\n\n\nIf you're not a fan of the Striker meta, or just want another SMG option in your arsenal, this WSP-9 loadout is the perfect option.

          "description": "The first Hades game sparked a thunderous surge of excitement in the gaming community, thanks to its gripping storyline and dynamic gameplay. Since then, fans have been eagerly awaiting a sequel, and now, that moment has finally arrived with its Early Access. But, you might be wondering: Is it necessary to play Hades 1 before diving into Hades 2? Here's what you need to know.\n\n\nCan you play Hades 2 without playing Hades 1?\n\n\nAccording to the Hades 2 FAQ page, playing Hades 1 before 2 is not a prerequisite, as it offers a relatively stand-alone storyline. However, it does maintain a connection to its predecessor, unfolding the events that follow the original. In Hades 2, you won't be stepping into the shoes of the previous protagonist Zagreus, but instead, you'll be immersed in the life of his sister Melinoë.\n\n\nImage via Supergiant Games\n\n\nWhile Hades 2 can be enjoyed as a stand-alone experience, veteran players can anticipate nostalgic callbacks from the original. But that's not all. New mechanics and challenges are also in store, promising to shake up the series' classic rogue-lite elements and keep you on your toes. Also, the story of Hades 2 incorporates characters that you get to meet and grow close to in Hades 1, adding a bit of a sentimental attachment to spur on more runs.\n\n\nEven if it's not a strict requirement, I still highly recommend playing the first Hades game. It's a fantastic way to grasp the gameplay and the rich narrative, heavily inspired by Greek mythology. This way, you can truly understand the buzz around the game and fully immerse yourself in the complete story. \n\nThe post Should you play Hades 1 before Hades 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Arcana in Hades 2 is one of the game’s systems of permanent progression. It’s pretty straightforward most of the time – you use Grasp to hold an unlocked card. However, some defy the expectation, and one of them is card XIII, The Centaur.\n\n\nThe Centaur is a bit frustrating because it’s a very useful card. Every five levels you gain 3 HP and 3 MP. It’s not massively significant but it’s passive and useful. There’s no reason not to take advantage of it.\n\n\nWhich cards activate XIII the Centaur Arcana in Hades 2, explained\n\n\nHowever, The Centaur says it requires 0 Grasp, but that doesn’t mean you can just activate it for free. Cards that require 0 Grasp have another method for activation that is described when you hover over it. For the Centaur it says:\n\n\n“Activate Cards that use 1 (Grasp) through 5 (Grasp).”\n\n\nMaybe you immediately understood what it meant, but I was stumped. A lot of cards cost between 1-5 Grasp, does that mean I need to activate all of them?\n\n\nNo, what it means is that you need to activate a card for each Grasp cost. This means you need to have an active card worth 1 Grasp, another worth 2 Grasp, then 3 Grasp, 4 Grasp, and 5 Grasp. You need at least one of each. Once you have them active, The Centaur will activate on its own with nothing else required.\n\n\nThis means that you need to have at least 15 Grasp to slot one of each of these cards. Thankfully, The Centaur doesn’t cost more than that, but it does slightly restrict what cards you want to carry in your hand.\n\nThe post How to activate Arcana XIII the Centaur in Hades 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Final Fantasy XIV maintenance scheduled to begin today, many players are trying to cram in some last-minute weekly tasks before servers go offline for their usual short window. However, thanks to a DDoS attack, players in every Data Center region are facing major issues and disruptions. \n\n\nDDoS attacks happen to all MMOs from time to time, and Final Fantasy XIV is certainly no stranger to them. The last one happened on April 12, with others hitting the online Final Fantasy in March and December. Thankfully, they're usually remedied within hours, but today's seems particularly pesky. Long-time players may notice there's an uptick in complaints across Twitter, Reddit, and your usual Discord stomping grounds. \n\n\n\n\nIt's not just North America, either. A quick glance over Twitter conversations shows players across Japan, Europe, and Oceania Data Centers hit with frequent outages, too. The official Lodestone post addressing the issue acknowledges as much, with players across social media reporting the same sorts of disconnects multiple times in short periods, or even being unable to log in at all.\n\n\nIn our own experience on the Primal Data Center, associate editor Andrea Shearon can't seem to stay connected for more than five to 15 minutes at a time, and noted the problem around 9 a.m. CST. The team at Square Enix is currently investigating the issue, as well as taking necessary countermeasures to try and get FFXIV back to its usual, stable state. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhile there is little information to go off of currently, past attacks have us hopeful the nuisance won't be a problem for very long. FFXIV Maintenance begins later — May 7 at 3 a.m. PDT — so hopefully, you can get your seasonal event chores finished up while juggling the outages. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV Data Centers in all regions hit with DDoS attack appeared first on Destructoid.",

Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!\nThis second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.\nSee Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

After playing several hours of the Early Access build (which is publicaly available as of today), we traveled to Supergiant Games' studio in San Francisco to interview several of the core team members – creative director Greg Kasavin, studio director Amir Rao, art director Jen Zee, composer Darren Korb, and voice actor Logan Cunningham – to get the full story of the game's creation. The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future. It also features an in-depth breakdown of Hades II's new features and our impressions …",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, the hit 2020 PlayStation-exclusive samurai game, rides onto PC on May 16, and ahead of the game's launch there, developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed players will not need a PlayStation Network account to play through the game's single-player story mode, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. \nThis follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. \nThank you for your feedback.\nMay 3, 2024\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. \nGhost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you going to play Ghost of Tsushima on PC?

The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.\nFounders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park. \nAre you excited for Epic Universe and Orlando's Super Nintendo World?

Playing a wastelander on a noble quest is something we’ve already done several times, but a game built around the events of a specific vault is an intriguing proposition.

As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. \nThis news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n\n\n\"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources,\" the release reads. \"As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024.\" \nWhile potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. \nThis release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July. \nWhat's your take on this news?

This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. \n\"Another year, another cycle,\" a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. \"The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair.\" \nHere's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: \nReturnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel\nReturnal Artbook\nFallen Asteria Animated Adaptation\nNow, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an \"animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria.\" Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nHousemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. \nIt's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement refers to or if it's just the first part of it since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. \nHere's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: \nThere's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. \nReturnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021.

As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. \n\n\nAs noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. \nAs for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: \"For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more.\"\nOther updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game.

In addition to painting the overall financial health of the studio, the report shares details on the current development state of Control 2, Max Payne 1&2 Remake, the Control multiplayer spin-off Codename Condor, and more.\nAccording to the report, the Control 2 team is “focused on finalizing the proof-of-concept stage, in which the game world, game mechanics and visual targets are proven.” The project is expected to move into the production readiness stage in Q2 of this year. Control 2 was first announced in 2022. \nMax Payne 1&2 Remake, first announced in 2022 as a rebuilt version that combines both games into a single title, remains in the production readiness stage, as first announced last Oc…",

          "description": "Housemarque, the developer of titles such as Returnal and Resogun, has teased some kind of announcement for tomorrow. \nIn a post on X, the developer simply posted a graphic of what appears to be a fractured reflection of a woman’s eyes with the word “Tomorrow.”\npic.twitter.com/F4R6TYFyZ1\nApril 29, 2024\nLess than two hours later, Housemarque shared a brief video clip of the same image but in animated form.\npic.twitter.com/uAkzYOCjjn\nApril 29, 2024\nWhile the kneejerk reaction is to assume this announcement is related to Returnal, be it a sequel or something else, that seems unlikely. In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. \nThankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.",

The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",
