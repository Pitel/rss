I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun. \r\n \nRead more",

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes.

Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's been over a decade since Blizzard, developers of StarCraft and WarCraft, released a new real-time strategy game, but not for want of enthusiasm from certain Blizzard developers. According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.\n Read more",

Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway.

Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza.

Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy.

          "description": "This one’s a very simple build at the moment, but neat enough that I wanted to shout it out. Near Mint is a roguelike deckbuilder where you advance through a tower fighting slightly stronger iterations of the exact same skeleton. Ok, nothing too captivating so far. The twist comes from the cards: someone’s left them in their Oodie pouch, spilt BBQ sauce down it, then stuck it in the wash before taking the deck out. Now, all the cards have split apart into three pieces. It’s name-your-own-price on Itch here, and it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get acquainted, but I’ll explain the gist below. Gist is a good word. Satisfying to say. Gist.\nRead more",

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

          "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

Now, well over two decades later, that idea is set to become a reality in Halo Infinite.\n\n\nImage via 343 Industries\n\n\nHalo Infinite third-person mode confirmed\n\n\n343 Industries confirmed the addition of third-person mode to Halo Infinite in a video on Twitter. It's an announcement that wouldn't feel out of place on April Fools' Day. Halo? Third-person?! I assure you, it's real, and frankly, it looks like a lot of fun.\n\n\nThe clips from the gameplay were marked as a work in progress, but a couple of interesting tidbits can be garnered from what has been shown so far.\n\n\n\n\nOne moment shows the player transitioning from first to third-person, indicating that you're not locked into one view for the entire match. It remains to be seen if the new third-person view is only available in specific modes. PvE combat was also shown, confirming Firefight will be getting the third-person treatment. Count me in. \n\n\nInterestingly, the footage features one moment involving the player struggling to see while entering a Shroud Screen. This shows the drawback of adding third-person to a game not initially designed for it, so it'll be interesting to see how 343 Industries handles things like this in the full release.\n\n\nEven if third-person mode doesn't become the de-facto way to play Halo Infinite going forward, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to try it out. It's currently set for a November release, with no specific date nailed down at the moment.\n\nThe post Halo Infinite is getting a third-person mode next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

In terms of available activities, there's plenty of freedom over what you want to do together. Unfortunately, your inventory can't be shared with your friend, and NCSoft's latest adventure is very strict about this.\n\n\nThrone and Liberty trading with friends explained\n\n\nWhen you participate in a quest with your friend, any rewards will be split equally. In fact, Throne and Liberty does have a player-driven economy where you can use your auctioning skills.

However, I hardly see that happening as NCSoft has already introduced the Auction House.\n\n\n\n\nHow does Auction House work in Throne and Liberty?\n\n\nThe Auction House allows you to trade your items and gears. To do that, you'll need a particular currency called the Lucent (this currency can be earned by simply playing the game). If you're looking for a specific piece of gear, you'll find it in the Auction House. Similarly, you can sell a gear that you don't need and earn Lucent in the process.\n\n\nPlease note that the Auction House is a work in progress as of this writing, and some major changes could be made to the system in the future. A direct trading system, on the other hand, could lead to unfair practices like botting. Moreover, it could also incentivize people to hoard their loot and ask for unexpected prices. All things considered, the presence of a universal Auction House is certainly a better trade-off.\n\nThe post Throne and Liberty: Can you trade with friends? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Check out where to find the Halloween NPC in Type Soul and do some ghostbusting.\n\n\nHow to find the Halloween NPC in Type Soul - Location\n\n\nIn order to find the Halloween NPC called the Mystery Witch in the Type Soul Halloween update, you have to go to Karakura Town. If you're not already there, just use your Senkaimon to spawn in the town. The goal is to go down, but the easiest way I orient myself (since I will get lost in one room, let alone a map as large as this one) is by heading to the Trader first. \n\n\nThe Trader is located on the balcony right across from Binders Bakery. There is a large tree and a pumpkin in this area so you can't miss it. Once you are there, jump over the fence next to the pumpkin and keep going diagonally to the left until you reach the edge. Now, go along the fence until you find an opening, then keep heading to the right.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are down to the lowest level, look for the purple sign with a bottle and numbers on it. The NPC is hiding in this alley right in the corner. Getting to the Mystery Witch is quite a hassle since you have to climb so far down, but it's worth it for the ability to fight off the ghosts. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nInteract with the Mystery Witch Halloween NPC to start the Halloween event.

          "description": "In the new Bleach-inspired Roblox game Paradox, you choose from three different Races each with their own different progression paths and evolutions. As you progress through various evolutions, others get locked out, making it important that you pre-plan and pick the right race. We've put together this Paradox Race Tier List so you know right from character creation what to work towards.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nParadox Race Tier List for all Unlocks and Evolutions (Launch Version)\n\n\nAll three races in Paradox have unique evolution paths, with ultimate pinnacle evolutions. Keep in mind, you cannot change your race once selected. These are typically the strongest options in Paradox (and are therefore in S Tier). Those in the A Tier are solid options to go into if you don't want to put in the grind for the S Tier evolutions. Those in the B Tier are typically the base versions of each Race, while those in the C Tier are reserved for the two side evolutions for Hollow. You won't stay as these evolutions for long, as they are very weak, but are intended as a challenge before evolving into the next variation. Here is our Paradox Race Tier List for every form of evolution and unlock for all of the Races at the time of launch:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nRessurection Arrancar (Hollow Evolution)\n\n\nSchrift Quincy (Quincy Unlock)\n\n\nVizard (Shinigami Unlock)\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nArrancar (Hollow Evolution)\n\n\nShikai (Shinigami Unlock)\n\n\nQuincy (Base Quincy)\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nAdjuchas (Hollow Evolution)\n\n\nSoul Reaper (Base Shinigami)\n\n\nVasto Lorde (Hollow Evolution)\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nFishbone (Hollow Evolution)\n\n\nMenos (Hollow Evolution)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Soul Reaper, Hollow, and Quincy all have an unlock or evolution that makes them S Tier. In Paradox, you can typically choose which of the three races' playstyle caters to you the most, then focus on their S tier unlock or evolution as you progress through the game while getting strong along the way.\n\nThe post Paradox Race Tier List appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nature's Jade is arguably one of the hardest resources in Throne and Liberty if you consider the rate at which they drop inside the game.\n\n\nNature's Jade is strictly linked with the activity of fishing, and it's beneficial if you're looking to upgrade your equipment. But to do so, you'll first have to find the resources in the required quantities. Unlike some of the more commonly available resources, you could end up getting confused trying to find Nature's Jade if you don't know where to look.\n\n\nHow to get Nature's Jade in Throne and Liberty\n\n\nThere are three ways to get Nature's Jade within the game. They're available from Small and Big Catch Sacks.\n\n\nYou can get these sacks in the same way as you get fish/treasures. There's no guarantee when you'll get these sacks. So far for me, getting a sack seems to happen randomly. Small is the most common one, and I am yet to get a Big Catch.\n\n\nWhen you get one of these sacks, there's no guarantee that there will be Nature's Jade in it. In fact, the odds of finding other resources are higher in most cases.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use Nature's Jade in Throne and Liberty\n\n\nThis particular resource is exclusively tied to fishing activity, as it helps you to upgrade your rods. Once you have enough Jade, go to Sundries Merchant (which can be found in different towns). By interacting with him, you'll be able to get the upgraded rods. For example, the Bamboo Fishing Rod can be upgraded to a Steel Fishing Rod in exchange for 10 Nature's Jade.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also get the Tevent Fishing Rod by exchanging Tevent's Soul Fragment. But do note that you'll need 100 Jade for this, so it can be pretty expensive. But investing your resources has some merit, as better rods will improve your fishing. I also believe that the better rods have higher chances of finding a sack, so consider the expense as an investment.\n\nThe post Throne and Liberty: How to get Nature’s Jade appeared first on Destructoid.",

The picture has since grown to over 2,300 likes on the platform. \n\n\nThe golden tint of the blade shows during the ending of Kingdom Hearts, in which the beloved rodent helps lock a huge door with Sora. He then appears with the weapon more often in later entries, making its appearance in Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a fun addition for fans.\n\n\nThere are a few current issues with the mod, however. At the time of writing, there's no custom material and it replaces the model and textures, there isn't a keychain, and the paint trail doesn't splash out of the tip of the keyblade—but further updates, should they come, may present a solution to them. Despite You can download the Kingdom Ket D mod from Nexusmods and follow the instructions there to join in on the fun.\n\n\nIn addition to the Kingdom Key D, the developer also added the Star Seeker keyblade on Wednesday, which is the version that Mickey uses in the PSP game Birth By Sleep. Prominent Kingdom Hearts YouTuber TheGamersJoint, in response, noted that he hopes to see the Kingdom Hearts model inside the game.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep things vanilla, the base game also has some bonus costumes inspired by classic cartoons like Steamboat Willie, which was the precursor to Mickey as we know him today.\n\nThe post Epic Mickey: Rebrushed gets wicked Kingdom Hearts mods appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!\nMuch like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.\nAre you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!\n>",

          "description": "Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají \"trochu divní\". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)",
