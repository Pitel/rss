A boutique independent, it was assembled by former Taito employees who previously contributed to the likes of RayStorm and G-Darius. G.Rev’s most famous work, and the one that put it on the map, is Border Down: a wonderfully original 2003 shooting game for Sega’s Naomi arcade hardware and Dreamcast console. It was followed in 2006 by Under Defeat, switching from the horizontal to the vertical and trading sci-fi for a grounded militaristic theme.\nNot to be confused with that other Dreamcast helicopter shoot 'em up, Psikyo’s Zero Gunner 2, Under Defeat pits pink-haired German soldier girls against the enemy forces of “The Union”. While any real-world similarities are dispelled by impossibly giant gunships torn from the pages of anime fiction, one of Under Defeat’s more interesting aspects is how hard-boiled it feels.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around \"eight to 12 hours a day\", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access.

He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.\nHowever, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.\nRead more",

Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.\nThe developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well?

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.\nThere are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

Trailered at this evening's Xbox Developer Direct, it releases for PC in fall 2025, and they're working on it in collaboration with Bayonetta and Nier: Automata devs Platinum Games. All of which very much tickles my dismemberable gizzards. Here's the reveal video.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Assassin's Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.\nI've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them?

On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.\nWhich is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct. \r\n \nRead more",

Archetype Entertainment.\nSummerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and \"paused operations\" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw.

          "description": "Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in October following the launch of the EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors I ran an AVX-512 performance comparison for the EPYC 9755 with 512-bit data path vs. 256-bit data path vs. AVX-512 disabled. That was interesting for showing the benefits of Zen 5's full 512-bit data path support compared to the \"double pumped\" approach with Zen 4 or optionally used via a BIOS option on Zen 5. AVX-512 continues to prove to be very performant and power efficient with AMD Zen 5 processors unlike with the early generations of AVX-512 on Intel processors. Here is a fresh look at the AVX-512 performance on a Supermicro server with an AMD EPYC 9655 processor.",

          "description": "After parting ways with Sir Hans in Troskowitz at the beginning of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you'll officially enter the open-world portion of the game. You'll overhear guards talking about some fresh graves nearby. Here is where you can find the fresh graves near Troskowitz in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh Graves location near Troskowitz\n\n\nYou can find the fresh graves to the southwest of Troskowitz near the tree line. Head west out of Troskowitz then south down the road until you pass the farm fields and the hill starts going down towards the trees. As you approach the trees, you will find a couple of graves amongst the bushes and rocks scattered near the treeline. These are the fresh graves you are looking for.\n\n\nShould you rob the graves?\n\n\nYou have the option of robbing the fresh graves, both for free loot and also to acquire information as to who lies inside them. Keep in mind you will need a Spade to dig up the fresh graves, as you cannot do so with your bare hands. You can buy a Spade from the merchant in Troskowitz, though it will cost you 6.7 Groschen. I simply went outside the town and collected a bunch of Sage and Chamomille to trade with the merchant for the Spade. You only get 0.1 Groschen per, but you get several each time you gather.\n\n\nI would recommend robbing the graves because this early on in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 you have pretty much nothing, and the loot is worthwhile. For example, one grave has a Von Bergow Knight Shield in it, which has 263 Defence but is also worth 249.6 Groschen, a massive value this early on. You'll also get a Bearded Axe and Flanged Mace, both of which are better weapon options than your current Hunting Sword.\n\n\nIf you choose to rob the graves, make sure you loot the bodies in both of them. One is located near the big rock closer to the road, while the other is under the small tree with a cross hanging from it.\n\nThe post Where to find the Fresh Graves near Troskowitz in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Team Rating: 86\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 Mason Mount Flashback SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's a set of solution you can use to unlock the latest Mason Mount card in Ultimate Team. \n\n\nTask 1 - Top Form\n\n\n\nAny 10 85-rated items\n\n\nAny 83-rated TOTW item\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Premier League\n\n\n\nSaka 87\n\n\nHasegawa 84\n\n\nGakpo 83\n\n\nCarpenter 83\n\n\nPajor 87\n\n\nSwanson 87\n\n\nPalacios 84\n\n\nPopp 87\n\n\nMarquinhos 87\n\n\nIcardi 83\n\n\nIago Aspas 84\n\n\n\nThe new Flashback is priced pretty decently at just 100,000 coins worth of fodder, but the main issue lies elsewhere. As a card, this Mount item has decent stats and playstyles, along with 5* Weak Foot. However, we are now in a meta that is dominated by TOTY cards with 3 PlayStyles+. Having cards with two good PlayStyles+ is pretty important, which begs the question about why EA Sports has released this card at all. \n\n\nThe only viable option with this card is to complete the SBC, and hope for a future evolution which allows you to improve its stats and playstyles. Otherwise, most players already have better options in their existing squads. \n\nThe post EA FC 25 Mason Mount Flashback SBC solutions appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps starring Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby is finally out, and it looks pretty neat. Unfortunately, however, Disney decided to pair that cool Nostalgia trip to Marvel's golden age with this poster:\n\n\nImage via Disney\n\n\nCatch anything strange? Upon first glance, the poster's only fault is the blandness permeating its every pixel. If you go all CSI on it, though, you'll find a bigger issue. As pointed out by Wayne Talbot on Bluesky, this weak sauce poster was actually the work of what tech bros call a highly advanced AI.\n\n\n\n\nSadly, Gen AI is already decent enough at generating human fingers most of the time, but that's been the go-to way of spotting whether an image has been generated via AI for a while. The four fingers of the person holding that flag are a dead giveaway. This means Disney not only used AI, it also couldn't be bothered to use the best type of Gen AI — or didn't use it very well.\n\n\nEven worse, Disney might've tried to correct this mistake by making it dumber. Gen AI is known for creating monstrosities anywhere it goes, but it's not used to repeating people's faces — it usually just steals and clones the faces of two different people! So, this seems to suggest Disney used Gen AI to make the poster, then had some poor artist dig into that crap to cover up some issue by doubling a poor woman's face.\n\n\nWe'll likely never know exactly what transpired behind the scenes to cause this poster to come out the way it did, but we're pretty sure it was stupid.\n\n\nImage via Disney/Wayne Talbot\n\n\nI never thought I'd say this, but I sure do miss the time when Marvel movies had posters that sucked ass in a completely normal and non-insidious way.\n\n\n\n\nWell, at least the trailer still looks pretty good.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps releases on July 25.\n\nThe post Fantastic Four’s trailer deserves better than this AI slop poster appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari is digging into its catalog of classics for another revival. This time it's the 1976 arcade game Breakout, which is coming back in style to spare thanks to the folks behind the BIT.TRIP series.\n\n\nDeveloper Choice Provisions' take on the arcade block-buster is titled Breakout Beyond, and at a glance, it's reminiscent of a few revivals that have opted for similarly explosive aesthetics. The gameplay itself is built upon the same core concept, but Beyond fires from its unassuming paddle with ricocheting lightning bolts and dynamic bursts of fireworks.\n\n\nOh yeah, and Breakout now plays horizontally, so there's that, too. Here's a look at how the colorful means of progression looks in action: \n\n\n\n\nMovement and destruction looks suitably chaotic despite the simplistic underpinnings, and it's all set to the rhythm of procedural audio and visual effects. As players move across the screen, they'll be tasked with building up combos to break through barriers so they can clear a path to the final goal. Special blocks are scattered throughout the arena, too, providing bonuses like brick-clearing explosions, protective barriers, and a laser cannon. \n\n\nBreakout Beyond boasts 72 levels in total, all of which are available to challenge solo or cooperatively with another player. From the short burst we get to see in the above trailer, co-op looks to make the proceedings even more chaotic, with the second player positioned to ricochet side-by-side or strategically placed behind or in front of their partner. \n\n\nThere's no concrete release date at this time other than being due out \"later this year.\" When Breakout Beyond launches, it'll be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Atari VCS.\n\nThe post Arcade classic Breakout returns in new game from BIT.TRIP studio appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We typically only get to hear the main cast of the original Metal Gear Solid games in one place when we're replaying the classics. Three of the key voice actors are having a bit of a reunion soon, however, thanks to a new Metroidvania called SteamDolls: Order of Chaos.\n\n\nAppropriately enough, this one is billed as a stealth-action platformer, so we're still technically on a stealth mission. This particular mission is now set to enter Early Access on February 11. The main cast in the latest from French-Belgian studio The Shady Gentleman includes David Hayter as The Whisper alongside Christopher Randolph and Jennifer Hale. Anyone nostalgic for the staccato burst of a patrolling exclamation point will recognize those names as the respective voices behind Solid Snake, Otacon, and Naomi Hunter.\n\n\nYou can hear how their voices sound in the context of the gritty, shadowed world of SteamDolls in the new release date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nThe Shady Gentleman first cooked SteamDolls up with inspiration from a comic book before taking the title to Kickstarter. Its campaign ended back in July 2020 with €94,828 pledged of a €30,000 goal, and the team originally had a projected delivery of May 2021. That didn't happen, but hopefully, the wait will have been worth it once it drops in a matter of days.\n\n\nAccording to the announcement, players who dive into Early Access can expect to play through six chapters of the game. That adds up to around five to seven hours of content, and the devs are hoping to use the feedback from this period to further refine everything for the eventual 1.0 launch. A free demo is still available, too, so you can hop in and hear that gravelly Hayter tone you know and love right now.   \n\nThe post New Metroidvania reunites original Metal Gear Solid voice actors appeared first on Destructoid.",
