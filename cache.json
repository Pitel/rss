Its 1992 predecessor, a retro gem and Sunsoft’s take on a mascot platformer, enjoys a cult reputation as one of the rarest games for the Famicom/NES owing to its limited release in Japan and, oddly enough, Sweden.\nIt certainly made an impression on Gothenburg-based Bitwave Games, the studio behind 2022’s Gimmick! Special Edition — a rerelease of the notoriously difficult original for modern consoles — and its unlikely sequel. Not only is the story behind the IP’s revival an interesting one, but we’re happy to report that Gimmick 2 lives up to and arguably outshines its 8-bit forbearer.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "X-cellent.\nThe roguelike genre has always been a bit of a tough nut to crack for many gamers. It’s not hard to understand why: procedurally generated environments and enemies generally don’t appeal quite as much as something that’s been carefully crafted with purpose. As such, if a roguelike is going to succeed, you best hope that the actual mechanics are rock solid. Thankfully, then, although Elsie doesn’t have a whole lot of original ideas to call its own, the Mega Man X-inspired gameplay is absolutely stellar, making for an experience that is effortlessly engaging and addictive.\nTaking place on the colourful planet Ekis, you take on the role of the titular protagonist, an android who is tasked with locating and saving a group of ‘Guardians’ who disappeared prior to Elsie’s creation. As far as plots go, it’s serviceable, but like a lot of roguelikes, it sort of fades into the background as you progress through, allowing the mechanics to shine through. That said, the NPC design is strong, with some solid voice acting implemented during key story breaks, and we relished every visit back to the main hub world to catch up with our pals and storekeepers.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.\r\n\n\r\nWhat do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass.

The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Not enough Microsoft jobs have been splayed and flayed atop the Altar of Growth, so High Priest Spencer must once again perform the Rite of Strategic Repositioning. According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people \"to organize our business for long term success\". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That \"long term success\" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, \"corporate and supporting functions\".\r\n \nRead more",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft shuttered its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest.

Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that \"ker kun, ker kun\" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as \"Japan-esque\", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.\nWhat I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.\nRead more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

I, a terrestrial chump, cannot help be taken in by it all. But I get the sense all this spacey wonder is just so much unremarkable grease pooling at the rim of a diner plate for my Star Trucker. He’s seen a couple things, that’s for sure. Taken the long way round the spiral arm to slip past security checkpoints and offload cases of booze for off-the-record cash. Seen reduced-to-clear Ginster’s wrappers glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. Hummed that Freebird solo a thousand times while waiting for the traffic to thin out near the shoulder of Orion.\nRead more",

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.\nGearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.\nRead more",

With Intel using Family 6 for so long it led to a lot of Linux kernel code just relying on Model ID comparisons for determining between Intel CPU generations and the like. Thus a lot of Intel CPU model handling reworks are needed for preparing future Intel CPU generations that will no longer be in Family 6.

Some of them will have high potential ratings, and they could be attractive propositions for those who love the Career Mode.

Wirtz and Musiala have also improved their overall ratings compared to FC 24.\n\n\nDestiny Udogie and Savio could be good choices for those who choose to build Premier League-based squads in the Premier League. The 82-rated duo would undoubtedly feature in many starter squads. The Barca duo of Balde and Yamal will be great fits for LaLiga fans.\n\n\nBenjami Sesko and Antonio Silva's base items might not appear attractive, but they could be well-served by promo cards in the future.

          "description": "Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection was only released on September 12, but the legend of a player called the \"Wazzler\" is already spreading. \n\n\nAccording to Steam reviews, this guy is like Thanos; running into him on ranked is inevitable. The unholy beatdowns he delivers are, too. It all makes perfect sense, though, because the Wazzler is none other than Justin Wong, 9-time EVO champion and the greatest Marvel vs Capcom player of all time. \n\n\nGetting bulled in a fighting game by Wong is nothing new. For example, a clip of him showing an eight-year-old the ropes in Mortal Kombat X has made its rounds on the internet for years. But Marvel vs Capcom is Justin's specialty, and this time, it's adults quitting the game in frustration.\n\n\nThe first mention of the Wazzler comes from Steam user \"TongOfDmg,\" who claimed that their run-in not only ruined his night but drove him to refund the game. Meanwhile, several other users have left reviews warning of the impending danger of Wazzler and the dire consequences of his wrath. \n\n\n\n\nBut maybe they've got Justin all wrong. Maybe, in a twisted way, his reign of terror is for the benefit of mankind. I mean, Steam user \"formerly\" said they made their entire family dinner while locked in an Iron Man combo. And anyone who brings family together like that is alright in my book.\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin himself seems to be having fun with the situation and acknowledged it on his Twitter. But what he said next might shake Marvel players to their core. After reaching the number one rank on the Steam and PlayStation 4 ladders, he announced the Nintendo Switch would be next. \n\n\nIt appears no platform is safe from his expanding empire, and I worry for myself and other Xbox players when the MvC collection comes to Xbox One next year. The only certainty is that if you dare go online with the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection, you must beware Wazzler.\n\nThe post Justin Wong is terrorizing the online ladder in MvC Fighting Collection appeared first on Destructoid.",

At the time, Oda Tilset and Martin Kvale, the duo behind NokNok Audio, were giving daily prompts on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\nThese prompts went down a storm and not only brought the community together in appreciation of each other's tiny builds but sparked conversation on both Twitter and in the game’s official Discord server. \n\n\nI’ve made no secret of how much I adore Tiny Glade. I ended up pouring over 20 hours into the demo, and I'm eagerly (and impatiently) waiting for the full release on September 23, so it goes without saying that I was one of the people sharing my own tiny builds in response to the daily prompts, among many others who did the same.\n\n\n\n\nIn the latest development diary from PounceLight, it was revealed that these daily prompts went down so well that they’re implementing them into Tiny Glade itself, and a unique prompt will appear on the main menu of the game each day. There are currently 30 prompts prepared to cover the first month after launch, so there will be a new challenge every single day.\n\n\nImage via PounceLight\n\n\nThat’s not all that was revealed in the development diary, though.

You only need to have four or five before they take up another shelf on your bookcase, and they don't exactly fit in with your reading materials. That's why it's a good idea to get editions of board games that look like books. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love a massive board game box. When the designers really go for it and create something stunning for the artwork on your board games, you want to show it off. Bookshelves aren't exactly the space to do this, though, considering they're made for, well, books. But you can have the best of both worlds with board games and editions that are designed to look like books.

One prevalent theme among modern manhwa is the incorporation of tower climbing. While there are numerous available tower climbing manhwa, some are simply not as good as others.\n\n\nAs the name implies, the trope revolves around climbing a mystical tower, which is often referred to as simply The Tower. The structure comes in multiple levels, sometimes exceeding 100 floors. While the outer appearance may seem rather limited, each floor is often a vast new world or dimension. Conquering The Tower often leads to power acquisition or a means to salvation, and these ten manhwa execute this trope to perfection.\n\n\nImage via IMDB\n\n\nTower of God\n\n\nTower of God …",

Explore the Statin Island residence to try and find... Lazlo's bloody stupid Witch Skin Hat.\n\n\nClue What We Do In The Shadows has you fighting over Lazlo's Witch Hat that Nadja likely hid in the first place\n\n\nGoing pace for pace with the absurd humor in the show, Clue: What We Do In The Shadows concerns itself with Lazlo's Witch Skin Hat. It's up to the players to identify who hid the hat, where they hid it, and the item that was used to conceal it. \n\n\nI mean it has to have been Nadja, but sure, we'll pretend like it could have been someone else. Although a particular devious vampire does come to mind...\n\n\nImage: theopgames\n\n\nThe core gameplay of Clue: What We Do In The Shadows remains the exact same as Clue. This edition is a purely aesthetic one, although it makes for a perfect theme considering that spooky season is around the corner, as is the show's final season (airing 21st October).\n\n\nIf you're stuck for a board game to play whilst Halloween and the new season loom ever closer, you may not find a better candidate than this one. Although I would have personally loved it if they'd added anything new to the standard Clue experience. Alas, I'll still likely enjoy this edition more than the standard Clue just because I get to stare at their pale faces the whole time. It's hard not to think of one of their outrageous quotes every time I see them.\n\n\nIn Clue: What We Do In The Shadows, you get to play as Lazlo, Nadja, Nandor, Colin, Guillermo, and, surprisingly, the Guide. As you try to find who hid the Witch Hat, you'll be searching in iconic settings, such as their bedrooms and the Fancy Room.\n\n\nThis Clue edition is oozing with character and is a novel and fun game to bring to the table for a little festive fun.\n\nThe post Clue What We Do In The Shadows lets you find Lazlo’s (Cursed) Witch Skin Hat appeared first on Destructoid.",

Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)",
