While all three locations only operated for a couple of months each, Kirby Café Tokyo popped up once again in 2018 and proved so popular with fans of the “powerful, pink puff” that it was ultimately reopened as a permanent establishment in 2019. Despite serving patrons for going on four years now (only two of which were during the fabled Before Times), Kirby Café Tokyo remains one of the most exclusive themed restaurants in all Japan – perhaps only rivaled by Kirby Café Hakata.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Titled Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance, nothing has been confirmed by the supposed developer GameMill at the moment. But Avatar fansite Avatar News states that it has seen the game, along with knowing when the game will potentially release. (Thanks, My Nintendo News!)\nAccording to Avatar News' source, Quest for Balance will be launching on 8th November, which is barely over two months away. GameMill is indeed involved with the game along with Paramount's subsidiary Avatar Studios. And the game's story is reportedly set after the events of the show. The members of the Order of the White Lotus will get together to share stories of the end of the Hundred Year War — but it's not a straight revisit of the show, as some memories may be inaccurate or unreliable.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Ubisoft making a game based on Marvel's sword-wielding vampire Blade was one of them, and because the internet is the internet, everyone went wild.

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.\nThe upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance. \nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.\nEvil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.\nRead more",

It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.\nSaints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.\nRead more",

You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.\nIt got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.\nRead more",

Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.\nI did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.\nRead more",

And yep, they were right on the money, with confirmation arriving today that the BB Boys will be pulling into Game Pass next week, on August 23rd. \nRead more",

I've spent some time with the game's early levels and it perfectly captures what I'd consider to be a 'classical' Soulslike: a game that's heavily focused on The Combat Bit above all else.\nDoes the game's combat rule? Yes, without a doubt. But will I continue playing? I'm not so sure. From what I've sampled, one strong pillar might not be enough to hold my attention for much longer.\nRead more",

          "description": "Golf games seem to be having a bit of a renaissance right now. From their beginnings on the fairway fringes of Flash-game forums, we now have been blessed with a handful of fun indie golf sims. We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.\nIt's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. \nHappily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for. \nRead more",

A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.\nWe Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.\nRead more",

          "description": "Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.\nEven with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.\nRead more",

Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.\r\n\n\r\nSo, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.\nYou play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.\nRead more",

I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I personally prefer controllers, so I avoid gaming on a keyboard when I can, but as a writer, having a clicky-clacky keyboard scratches an itch in my brain that nothing else can. I love a full mechanical keyboard given the writing thing, but for gaming purposes, the left side is really all you need.

          "description": "Two days of free online multiplayer this weekend\nIf you're looking to steal cars, dunk some basketballs, or play some team deathmatch with your pals on PlayStation, this weekend's a good opportunity. PlayStation Plus is hosting a free online multiplayer weekend in a few days.\nThis coming weekend, August 27 and 28, PlayStation 4 and PS5 users will be able to play multiplayer on their games without needing PlayStation Plus. Traditionally, some games have their multiplayer gated by PS Plus. But those will have their doors thrown open for two days, for everyone to get a chance.\nYou do, of course, need to purchase the games themselves to actually play. You'll also need a PSN account, if you don't have one already.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1561714809128816640\nIt's not a big event for those already subscribed to Sony's offerings. But I can imagine at least a few folks might have let their subs lapse. This provides a nice chance to hop online and play some games in your library against others. Maybe you've been itching to pick Guilty Gear Strive back up post-Evo, or you just want to run around guns-blazing in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Either way, the multiplayer world's your oyster for two days this weekend.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7Ivdq5E-fs\nOn the Plus side\nSony has been gradually ramping up its Plus offerings in the wake of its new three-tiered plan. While the basic subscription still exists for those who want to just pick up the Plus games and play online multiplayer, a few higher-tier offerings give a little more access each month.\nThe Yakuza series, for example, is making its way over in its entirety over the course of this year. You'll need PlayStation Plus Premium to access all of them, though. The Premium tier also offers a ton of retro games, which PlayStation has been chipping into over time.\nThe post PlayStation Plus is hosting a free weekend, starting this Saturday appeared first on Destructoid.",

One of the first things I did while attending college is play through World Tour with a new acquaintance. It’s become a staple series for my husband and me to play. It’s simple. You drop in as a monster and mindlessly smash things until the game ends. Rampage: Universal Tour even had a hint of strategy in managing your stock of lives.\nRampage Through Time is the last of the games I had yet to play unless you count some portable ports. It only came out on the PS1 in 2000, having never received a port or re-release. Because of that, it’s been something of a mystery for me.

Thankfully, Sony hasn’t completely deserted mobile gaming fans, and has teamed up with Backbone to create the latest Backbone accessory controller for iPhone.\nFirst things first, this is a sexy device.

Deadline reports that a film based on Gravity Rush is in development.\nAccording to Deadline, PlayStation Productions and Scott Free Productions have launched development. Anna Mastro (Secret Society of Second Born Royals) looks to be attached as director, with Emily Jerome on the script.\nGravity Rush is the pushing-and-pulling action-adventure series from Sony Japan Studio, where protagonist Kat can bend gravity to her will. She fights monsters, defends her hometown, and also does the occasional odd job for others.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMGaMOyr0GI\nDeadline says it's not clear who will produce the Gravity Rush film as of yet. Distribution is also apparently unclear.\nRushing to the silver screen\nGravity Rush just adds to the rapidly growing list of PlayStation IP productions in development. Alongside the Gravity Rush film, we also heard from Deadline's report last week that Sony is planning on a Days Gone film.\nIt's not just film adaptations, either. Twisted Metal has a series in development, and reports of Horizon and God of War series have also popped up. Plus, The Last of Us just got a first-look clip in an HBO sizzle reel.\nThe Gravity Rush movie news is actually pretty exciting, as I personally think this series would make the jump to film pretty well. It's got a good basis for some cozy, feel-good, slice-of-life moments. And Kat's gravity powers could make for pretty exciting action setpieces.\nThere's the stinger of Sony Japan's down-scaling, though, as that deflates any of my hopes for some new Gravity Rush around this. Regardless, it looks like Sony is carrying on with adapting a ton of its properties into film and TV. It's anyone's guess as to what could or could not be next.\nThe post A Gravity Rush movie is reportedly in development appeared first on Destructoid.",

We also finally got a real look at The Last of Us TV show, which is still due in \"early 2023.\"\nThe clip opens up with Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) walking up to a snow-filled bridge while ominous music plays. From there, we're greeted with an array of footage from the project, including plenty of footage of Pascal and Ramsey's performances, complete with voice-over. We even get to see a quick clip of Nick Offerman as Bill, and a tease of the disease that's running rampant through this universe.\nIt's a promising short look at the series, which will feature episodes written by Neil Druckmann, who is ostensibly the \"showrunner\" of the game series. His involvement has helped ease concerns about the inherent danger of game adaptations. Pascal has also mentioned in the past that he aims to give his own spin on Joel, and the footage thus far hints that we could see the series move in a different direction. So long as everything holds up, it'll be fantastic if the TV show is a companion piece of sorts rather than a carbon copy.\nThe Last of Us bit starts at roughly 1:40 in, and you can watch it below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWsY3DlLdIA\nThe post Here’s our first real in motion look at The Last of Us TV show appeared first on Destructoid.",

Typically, this means that the reward is roughly a week out. While there are no keychains currently for sale, they've ranged from 400 to 800 Platinum Points in the past.\nIf you don't want to wait, there's a printable (digital file) pop-up card for Kirby's Dream Buffet that you can get now. It'll cost you 30 Platinum Points. Nintendo also reminds everyone that the recent Kirby 30th anniversary concert is now online, and there's a Dream Buffet wallpaper reward available.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

They point out that mainline 3D entries generally take longer and longer with each release, with every game sequentially increasing development time through the new gap between Zelda games today.\nAs they point out, Zelda fans are generally willing to wait for quality, and I don't need to repeat the \"delayed game\" mantra once again as it's ingrained in this series. But the main observation stems from a lack of original \"portable\" games to aid the droughts. The last one we had was the Link's Awakening remake, which is decidedly not an original game. You can, however, make the case for Cadence of Hyrule, Skyward Sword HD, and Age of Calamity ensuring that the series hasn't remained dormant.\nFor a while, Zelda fans were eating well in terms of supplemental games backing major 3D releases. I mean Wind Waker into Minish Cap into Twilight Princess, then Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks into Skyward Sword: that's a hell of a run. And Ocarina of Time 3D (a re-release) was just kind of thrown in there too!\nWhile Breath of the Wild 2 will likely be the next major Zelda entry at this point with a planned 2023 release, I hope we get a Minish Cap-style wildcard to assist with the next wait.\nThe post At this point, it’s been the longest gap between mainline Zelda games, ever appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fighting with friends (and strangers)\nIt's been a banner couple of days for Pokémon fans as this weekend marked the return of the Pokémon World Championship. Like with most everything else that's fun in the world, the long-running tournament was postponed in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. This was a year of change for the event with Pokkén Tournament DX making its final appearance at the show while Pokémon Unite and Pokémon Go both made their official debut. As the PWC is all about competition, the Pokémon Company used the occasion to debut a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet that highlights some of the new items players can use to turn the tide of battle.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zFq5nd0tU\nThe Loaded Dice item seems a tad unfair, but I have to say I'm excited about the possibilities something like Mirror Herb will have on my, admittedly, poor competitive Pokémon play.\nIf you're more into the Pokémon Trading Card Game than its video game brethren, there is news for you too. Pokémon TCG will be getting new cards based on Scarlet/Violet starting in 2023. I haven't been paying attention since Pokémon cards were red hot during the pandemic and guys with terrible YouTube channels would strip the shelves bare at Target and Walmart, but I hope these will be easy to find next year. Though, if this story about adults buying Happy Meals to get the Pokémon cards inside is anything to go by, you should probably start making plans now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCO94IFsY8M\nAs for the next Pokémon World Championships, during the closing ceremonies of the year's event, it was announced the 2023 showcase will be held in Yokohama, Japan, marking the first time the PWC will take place in Japan.\nhttps://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/1561383485323055109\nThe post Pokemon Scarlet and Violet get competitive in a fresh trailer from the Pokemon World Championships appeared first on Destructoid.",

I imagine the original script might have had lead character Frey say \"And oh yeah, I'm talking TO MY SLEEVE!\", which would work fine in a cutesy, family Sci-Fi wort of way. But then the \"Business Strategy and Branding Lead\" came in and said \"Oh no you can't say 'my' because those magic talking sleeves are going to be sold as NFTs to players across the world in 2024. We want everyone to feel like they can own one, not just Frey. And you can't call them 'sleeves' either because we're going to call the NFTs 'Tough Cuffs'. The SEO on that shit is pure dynamite.\"\nAnd that's how Forspoken \"Talking to a cuff!\" trailer was (probably) born.\nIt was with that nightmare in mind that I've started posting new re-recordings of that god forsaken Forspoken dialogue every day until the game is released on January 24, 2023. That's 165 days, folks! 11 days in and I haven't missed an upload yet, though doing most of the acting on the videos on my own may make my brain melt soon enough.\nYou can find a thread of them in progress on Twitter, and for your convivence, my collaborators and I have compiled the best of them (so far) in the video below. They aren't all keepers, but I'm semi-proud of my Solid Snake and Louie Armstrong impersonations.

Players guide a jumpsuited protagonist as they sprint down a hi-tech corridor laden with traps, hazards, and obstacles. The crazy sprinting action is automatic and unstoppable, with the player tasked with keeping our star from coming a cropper at the myriad objects that lay strewn in their path.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyTHqUgqu3k\nIn a crazy headlong dash against the clock, The Runner must dodge and/or leap over the obstacles, while picking up drinks to maintain their stamina and even boarding a handy skateboard in order to increase their momentum. Like so many fast scrolling titles of the day, Metro-Cross is a little dizzying, not helped by the game's checkerboard pattern, but it's an amusing oddity, and as such it's neat to see it added to Hamster's ever-growing collection of games that time forgot. A sequel, Aero-Cross, was being developed in the late-'00s for release on Xbox Live Arcade, but the game was ultimately canceled.\nMetro-Cross is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s hurdlin’ classic Metro-Cross joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You ever think about how short cats are?\nNothing makes a game feel fresh like looking at it from a different perspective. I'm not just being philosophical here — someone modded Stray so you can play the game in first-person. Personally, that might make me a bit motion sick with all the jumping and such, but if you're looking to replay and switch up your Stray experience, this mod might be the perfect fit.\nAptly named Stray - First Person Mod, it allows you to see the game as if you were the cat himself (or herself? I don't think I ever figured out what gender the cat is supposed to be in the game). The mod was created by a user named Jessica Natalia, and you can download it over on NexusMods (via The Gamer).\nI could definitely see how the first-person perspective would make the experience more immersive, but it's better saved for at least a second playthrough considering many of the puzzles are better suited to a third-person view. Just based on the demo video of the Stray mod, though, it is pretty cool to see the world through a cat's eyes in a game that was designed for you to see the world from a cat's perspective.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU2r1xwBZD0\nAs can be common with mods, there are a few bugs to be aware of with this one.\nNothing game-breaking, but the cat can become visible if you move quickly, or when walking too close to a wall which makes the camera pop out of place — this happens because the modder moved the placement of where the camera is situated to be where the cat's head is, rather than removing the cat's character model altogether.\nOf all the games I've seen get first-person mods, I think it probably makes the most sense in Stray considering perspective is part of the game's narrative themes.\nNow I'm just waiting for the Stray VR mod.\nThe post See the world through feline eyes with this first-person Stray mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Don't let maps and bars get in the way of your perfect shot\nI've been slowly whiling away the hours over the last few weeks with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, a fun and incredibly scenic RPG. And this week, I picked up a little trick that I wish I had known about from the get-go: a shortcut for easy, HUD-less Xenoblade screenshots.\nIn most games, I tend to be a screenshot fiend. Part of that is, well, part of the job; if I know I'm going to want to write about something later, having a bevy of good screenshots is useful. But I also like to catalogue my journey, remembering specific moments, lines, and vistas from throughout my time there.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 has some good camera options, including one that lets you essentially go full-on first-person mode. But Nintendo of Europe tweeted out this handy tip that changed my Xenoblade screenshot life for the better. If you press the L and R buttons simultaneously, you can easily snap a screenshot without the heads-up display.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1559132800028233729\nAfter seeing this, I went directly into my game and started trying it. And indeed, it's basically a macro. The game dips out the HUD, snaps a screenshot, and re-ups the display. It's startling how well this works in real-time; I was a little worried I'd have to give it a bit of lead time, but no, it happens pretty darn fast.\nA photo album of adventure\nNow I've been revisiting all the places I blew through in my early hours of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 to get new screenshots. Capturing some of the massive landscapes, beautiful views, and colossal sights makes for a fun diversion from the main plot.\nIt helps that Xenoblade Chronicles 3, on top of being quite a good game, is also a very scenic game. It feels like Monolith Soft ekes incredible views out of the Nintendo Switch, and now, I've got a great tool for preserving them without too much fuss.\nThe post PSA: Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has a handy shortcut for HUD-free screenshots appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A new movie could be just around the Bend\nIt looks like another silver screen Sony adaptation could be on the way. Deadline reports that Sony is currently working on a movie rendition of Days Gone, its post-apocalyptic zombie game with bikers.\nAccording to Deadline, Sam Heughan (Outlander) is \"circling\" the project and screenwriter Sheldon Turner is adapting. Turner and Jennifer Klein are reportedly set to produce, along with Sony PlayStation Productions.\nIn case you've forgotten, Days Gone is Sony Bend's biker-zombie action game. Released in 2019, Days Gone was like a mixture of The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy, following Deacon \"Deke\" St. John as he tries to survive in a zombie-infested Pacific Northwest.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Ztt2bXI64\nDeadline reports that it's heard Turner's script will be a \"love ballad to motorcycle movies.\" Which, well, lines up with Days Gone for sure.\nVideo game theater\nIf plans go through, this will mark another in a growing catalogue of Sony's video game adaptations. Uncharted pulled in some solid numbers, even if the reception seems mixed. And HBO's The Last of Us is on the horizon, turning Joel and Ellie's cross-continental adventure into a miniseries that hopefully won't be disrupted by whatever the heck is going on over there right now.\nOf the many Sony properties still around, Days Gone certainly seems like it could draw in a more mainstream movie-going audience. It's got bikers, zombies, and grit. You could probably have some pretty sick action sequences with massive \"Freaker\" hordes and revving motorcycles.\nWe'll have to see if this particular Sony production ends up moving forward or not. There are a few others, like the Twisted Metal adaptation, that are also in the works. Plus, the Ghost of Tsushima film, the Horizon series at Netflix, and projects for Gran Turismo and God of War. Sony's screen adaptations have only just begun, it seems.\nThe post Sony is reportedly developing a Days Gone movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

The one-day event will see Inklings and Octolings pick sides in a three-way turf war, hosted by the idols of Deep Cut.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiuIZN0KDFQ\nThe three teams are Rock, Paper, and Scissors. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. PT, the action will carry on as usual; teams will fight each other in the usual Splatfest turf bouts.\nThen, halfway through the day, it all shifts around. The game mode swaps to the Tricolor Turf War, with three teams fighting at the same time. The leading team will try to defend its turf and hold control of the Ultra Signal, while the other two trailing teams storm in to try and throw the leader off.\nA three-way turf war\nAside from settling the great debate of Rock, Paper, Scissors, this will also be a chance for players to get some hands-on time with Splatoon 3.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtMOAvOWTvY\nLast week, we got a full Direct on Splatoon 3, showcasing all the features and updates coming to the third iteration of this squid-based shooter. From big additions like an entire new tabletop card game to small ones like an always-open Salmon Run, seems like a lot's on the way for Splatoon. This Splatfest demo will be the opportunity to try out new weapons, new moves, and get a feel for how the turf bouts will go down ahead of launch.\nSplatoon 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on September 9, 2022. Grab the Splatfest demo on the eShop here.\nThe post The Splatoon 3 Splatfest demo is available for pre-load now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You're not even my real dad\nSpelunker may be considered by the Japanese to be a “densetsu no kusoge” or “crappy game of legend,” but I consider myself a fan. It wasn’t bad, it was just sort of a jerk. It made bank in Japan, but it then started filling up the bargain bins. So, you have to wonder what led to the development of Spelunker’s sequels: Spelunker II on arcade and, confusingly, Spelunker II on Famicom. Were they trying to make more money off the name, or were they trying to continue the legacy by making a worse game?\nI don’t have an answer to that question, and by the end of this article, I still won’t have an answer. Spelunker II: Yuusha he no Chousen on Famicom isn’t terrible. It’s not great, but I’ve played much worse. More strikingly, it has very little to do with the original …",

You can pick them up through August 26, at 9:59 JST — at which point they'll cycle out for something else. They cost a nominal amount of Platinum Points from the My Nintendo system to pick up, and you'll grab them on your actual Switch in the Switch Online app.\nWeek 4 of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 icons (August 18 tweet):\nhttps://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1560431971314315265\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nBeyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: \nMove: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. \nMove: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.\nItem: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. \nItem: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. \n\nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. \nAre you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. \nDesiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. \nSporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

These packs could be purchased to grant players things like character tokens for instant fighter unlocks, exclusive banners, and the premium in-game currency, Gleamium. It seems these packs sold extremely well in the U.S. as they brought in enough money to make MultiVersus the best-selling title in the U.S. in July, according to the latest NPD numbers. \nMat Piscatella, the executive director of The NPD Group, which is a video game sales and trends analyst group, released his monthly thread on the video game market for the…",

And this multi-generational mainstream audience makes Dragon Ball ideally suited for a collaboration with Fortnite and its worldwide community of players. We’re excited to see the response to Dragon Ball’s arrival in Fortnite.” \nEpic Games notes that, in case you missed it, there are already Dragon Ball creative islands available in the game for you to visit. There are multiple Dragon Ball Super Episode Festival islands, and from now until Sept. 17, you can board a cruise ship and watch select episodes from Dragon Ball Super on them.

The first game dropped over a decade ago, and ever since, zombie-slaying fans have yearned for a sequel. Well, they're in luck. A Dead Island 2: Day One Edition positing was spotted on Amazon with box art, in-game photos, and a 2023 release date. The new info was taken down, but we made sure to grab the images and extra deets for you. \nAccording to the info on the Amazon page, Dead Island 2 will be available on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. However, current-gen versions of the game don't have web pages yet. The story follows an elite squad that's immune to the infection, meaning we'll be seeing 8-player co-op when the game drops. The full summary reads as follows:\nPlayers must craft zany weapons like in the first game to defeat the seemingly never-ending hordes plaguing the West Coast. Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios' gory adventure allegedly launches on February 3, 2023 (or at least that's what appeared on the listings earlier today before suddenly disappearing).

          "description": "Inkulinati is a imagiative strategy game first announced in 2020 that brings the distinct art of medieval manuscripts to life. The game unfolds within the parchment itself as players control humans, animals, and mythical creatures to battle it out in turn-based battles that are equal parts thoughtful and ridiculous. Inkulinati has looked promising every time it’s made an appearance, and we can finally see how it's shaping up thanks to an upcoming early access launch. \nThis winter, players can dive into Inkulinati on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. The game puts you in the role of Inkulinati, a being capable of using the magical Living Ink to bring illustrations to life. The irreverent battles unfold within an open book as players command units to strategically slice, bludgeon, and even fart opponents into submission to clear the way and topple the opposing Inkulinati. \n\n\nIn addition to recruiting humans, rabbits, cats, snails, and other critters, you can enlist the aid of real-life literary figures such as Dante Alighieri. Each unit sports its own unique traits with more team members unlocked by playing. Stages promote different playstyles, with some requiring a more tactical approach and others a more aggressive assault. The game features a single-player campaign, and you can challenge friends in 1-on-1 battles.\nAnd for those wondering: yes, this is a different game than Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's recently announced narrative adventure game that shares the same artistic influences.  \nInkulinati will be available first on Xbox and PC, but a Switch version is also planned with other platforms in consideration. The game will be playable at the Xbox booth during Gamescom next week.",

Unfortunately, the promising sci-fi platformer Planet of Lana joins that growing hit list.\nPlanet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. \nPlanet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.\nIf you're losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.",

The studio’s earlier project found players navigating a train on its way through hell, using deckbuilding card mechanics to fight one challenging battle after the next. In Inkbound, the team has held onto the roguelike formula, but almost everything else is going in a new direction.\nPlayers each control a character making their way through a magical world called Atheneum, a place from which countless stories emerge and come to life. Players enter realms defined by books and help to shape and define the worlds and narratives within.

Of course, other titles will be shown as well including Dying Light 2’s Bloody Ties DLC and Telltale Games' The Expanse. \nNext Tuesday, @geoffkeighley hosts @gamescom Opening Night Live from Germany.\nhttps://t.co/OkSQIuOqPG pic.twitter.com/Mz0Gcux1X7\nAugust 17, 2022\nHogwarts Legacy was recently delayed to February, and this will be our first look at it since its gameplay reveal in March.

However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. \nThat could change soon as Dying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom's Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: \n\n\n\"What dangers await?\" a press release reads. \"How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal.\" \nAs you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Dying Light 2 review and then read our interview about the future of Dying Light 2. \nAre you excited about this DLC?

Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.\nThe action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.\n\nIf it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.\nThe new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.",

          "description": "Disney announced that it will hold a Disney & Marvel Games Showcase next month, live from its D23 Expo. \nMore specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature \"incredible new content\" from Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a \"sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.\" \nJUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F\nAugust 15, 2022\nYou might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. \nConsidering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9. \nWhat Marvel heroes do you hope Hennig's game features?

That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” \n“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” \nWētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” \n“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. \nThis new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). \nWhile waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this ends up being?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. \nDevil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.\nCheck it out for yourself below: \nWelcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD\nAugust 11, 2022\nAs you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18. \nFor more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, check out the game’s first extended gameplay reveal from earlier this summer, and then read our preview of the game after checking it out in June.
