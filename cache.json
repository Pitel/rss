You get Hauntii, a twin-stick shooter, puzzle-platformer, and adventure game from tiny development studio Moonloop Games. An unexpected mixture, to be sure — but that's what indie games are all about, and we're always down for a new genre mash-up.\nThe story is the part that reminds us of Pixar — and, considering their mastery of storytelling, it's no bad thing. You awake as a small black smudge of a wisp with no memories, in a monochromatic world you don't recognise. A being with long, flowing hair in a white robe — an angel, perhaps — appears to guide you through the world, out of this wilderness and into the light, but you are dragged to the ground once more, chained down, unable to break free. Now, you'll have to venture through the land of the dead, slowly piecing together your life and your afterlife, and breaking those chains through self-discovery.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The problem is that the Pro Controller packs in so many features that it feels like something's missing as soon as we play without them.\nMotion controls, HD rumble, built-in NFC amiibo reader, a 40-hour battery life. It's a pretty enviable list, no? One thing that the Pro Controller does not offer, however, is a novelty figurine in the handle. This is the category where PDP's REALMz Wireless Controller triumphs.

Not by the government, but by the only force in King City that matters – The Company. Capes takes the turn-based strategy genre and gives it a comic book feel, putting you in the control of a fledgling group of superheroes trying to dish out justice in a city where justice doesn’t exist. While some of its visuals lack a bit of polish, the actual gameplay in Capes is heroic enough to make up for it.\nIf you throw The Boys and Watchmen into a blender with XCOM 2, what you’d be left with would be Capes. Developer Spitfire Interactive knew exactly the tone it was going for and stuck with it. You start with two superheroes and a grizzled veteran calling the shots from a bunker and slowly assemble a team capable of freeing King City from the grip of The Company, which is so evil it doesn’t need a proper name.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.\nRead more",

The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It's dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter. It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.\nRead more",

Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like.

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

          "description": "Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

The interests of the game's creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.\nRead more",

He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his.

Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. \"Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it's always raining,\" he tells me. \"But there's one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam's acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

My leg-snappin' plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.\nRead more",

A bunch of players are competing to cross the finish line of a brutally difficult tower of racetracks in racing game Trackmania, with a prize pool of $30,000 waiting for the first three drivers to reach the top. The course is a huge, winding gauntlet made of pieces suspended in midair, and even expert players have fallen from their positions over 1000 times, their cars hurtling back to the bottom of the tower to start again. The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising.

          "description": "Studio SARU and Production I.G have just unveiled a teaser for an upcoming Ghost In The Shell anime, titled only The Ghost In The Shell.\n\n\nThe original Ghost in the Shell is based on the manga of the same name, and this new project seems to be a new adaptation of that. New media in the Ghost In the Shell franchise isn't necessarily a rare thing, though, with the franchise spanning multiple animated adaptations, video games, and even an infamous Hollywood movie that starred Scarlett Johansson. \n\n\n\n\nThe project is being helmed by Studio SARU, which recently made Scott Pilgrim Takes Off for Netflix, a reimagining of the classic comic that earned critic and fan acclaim for its bold and refreshing take on the beloved story and characters. \n\n\nWill we be seeing a similar approach with the new Ghost In the Shell adaptation? Fans are already speculating we could be looking into something similar to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Studio SARU pull off something incredible, or will it go the safe route? The teaser doesn't reveal much, so we might be looking at a couple of years of intense speculation.\n\n\nDespite various other adaptations taking a stab at the story, the original Ghost In the Shell film is still considered the best outing in the franchise and is one of the most beloved works of sci-fi in history. Even if you haven't seen the original movie, you've seen one of the hundreds of properties inspired by it. Though it came out in 1995, it hasn't aged a day, and its story is still a poignant and relevant tale backed by some of the best — if not the best — animated sequences in the history of Japanese animation.\n\n\nThe new Ghost In the Shell anime will hopefully land in 2026, but you can currently watch the original Ghost In the Shell on Prime Video.\n\nThe post New Ghost in the Shell anime is targeting 2026 release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As you ascend your characters in Wuthering Waves, the materials you'll need become increasingly difficult to find. Mysterious Code is one such item, as you won't find it through boss grinding. Here's how to get Mysterious Code for your next character ascension.\n\n\nWhere to obtain Mysterious Code in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nYou can get up to three Mysterious Codes from Sonance Casket deliveries. You'll find your first one after completing level three, with levels seven and nine also featuring this item. You'll encounter Sonance Caskets as you explore Wuthering Waves' overworld and cities, making it worthwhile to hunt for them as you go.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can also find Mysterious Code as a reward during the main storyline. Although you won't find it during every quest, it occasionally appears among your rewards, allowing you to obtain some as you play. To check whether you'll get Mysterious Code soon, head into your quest list, select a main story quest, and check its rewards.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhether it's worth hunting for Mysterious Code depends entirely on how long you plan to use Rover during your playthrough. Over time, you'll gain other characters who can take their place at your party. However, finding Sonance Caskets offers rewards beyond Mysterious Code, such as Astrite, EXP potions, and Rover's Waveband, making them beneficial in multiple ways. \n\n\nHow to use Mysterious Code in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nThe main purpose of Mysterious Code is to ascend Rover, the protagonist of Wuthering Waves. Starting from your second ascension, you'll need Mysterious Code to ascend the character alongside materials such as MF Whisperin Core and Pecok Flower. This resource is exclusive to Rover, so you won't have to worry about farming it for other character ascensions.\n\nThe post How to get Mysterious Code in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

Challenged to keep the story within 30 pages, Sapkowski submitted the original short story “The Witcher” in 1986. He came in third place in the competition, but this original short story was the jumping-off point for an entire fantasy empire. \n\n\nThis first short story, as well as four others, were later collated and published as a collection of short stories, under the title of “The Witch…",

He's not the first actor to return to the same role they had in the video game, but it's a pleasing trend to see the series continuing nonetheless.\n\n\nWright played Isaac Dixon in The Last of Us Part II, which launched on the PlayStation 4 in 2020. Isaac, for those who may not recall, is the leader of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF). The group stands opposite another in-game faction, the Seraphites, often referred to as \"Scars.\" Both groups were antagonistic forces to Ellie and her allies, with the cultish Scars being particularly brutal.\n\n\n\n\nWright returns to reprise his role from the game\n\n\nIn the game, the WLF made the decaying ruins of Seattle its home turf. Battles between the group and the Seraphites raged on until the two managed a shaky truce. Abby, the deuteragonist of the game, was part of the WLF. If the show follows along with the events of the game, we'll likely see the WLF and its calculating leader not long after Seattle gets thrown under the spotlight.\n\n\nAs mentioned, Wright certainly isn't the first actor to join The Last of Us series as the character they portrayed in the game. Merle Dandridge reprised her role as Marlene, the Firefly commander who tasked Joel to transport Ellie in The Last of Us Part I. Both Troy Baker, who voiced Joel in the game, and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Ellie, also made an appearance in the first season but not as their characters.\n\n\nImage via Max\n\n\nWright will appear alongside Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, who return as Joel and Ellie, respectively. They will also be joined by Catherine O'Hara in an unknown role. \n\n\nThe Last of Us Season 2 doesn't have a premiere date yet, but is scheduled to arrive on HBO and Max in 2025.\n\nThe post The Last of Us season 2 brings in Jeffrey Wright to reprise his role as Isaac appeared first on Destructoid.",

Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"</p>\n\n<p>He also briefly touches on the future of <em>The Last of Us</em> TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.</p>\n\n<p>You can read the full interview <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html\">here</a>.

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kr3br-3i8TY\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.</p>\n\n<p>Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: <em>Baptism of Fire</em>, <em>The Tower of the Swallow,</em> and <em>Lady of the Lake</em>. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and&nbsp;Freya Allan&nbsp;(Ciri).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1790396884873355624\">You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here</a>. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GF8M0YoySoc\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Head to&nbsp;<em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/gameinformer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills</p>\n\n<p>The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>",
