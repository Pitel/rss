Oh, and Sonic Origins is also locked in for 23rd June, but not without some controversy over those pre-orders. And, even though it's been rumoured for ages, we've got more concrete proof that Game Boy and GBA games will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online at some point, probably.\nNow it's time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans.

          "description": "Dead good.\nRebellion has got a pretty great track record when it comes to porting its schlocky range of shooters over to Nintendo Switch, with both Zombie Army Trilogy and Sniper Elite 4 the most recent examples of how this developer manages to successfully squeeze a whole lot of slo-mo headshots, shambling zombie hordes and co-operative carnage onto the diminutive console without sacrificing too much in the way of performance or playability.\nZombie Army 4: Dead War is the studio's latest bombastic offering, a game that's been available on other platforms since February of 2020, and it's one the team found to be its toughest assignment to date in terms of getting it up and running within the rather restrictive memory limitations on Switch. We're not surprised, this is a big old action-packed game after all, and we were a tad concerned at hearing about the technical struggles in the build-up to our review period. As it turns out, we needn't have worried at all, as Rebellion has continued its streak here with another solid port that serves up a great big bloody feast of Nazi zombie-slaying action.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "N64 Mini when, Nintendo?\nPrior to the arrival of the Switch, one of the most exciting developments in the world of Nintendo hardware was the NES Classic, a micro-console filled with 8-bit titles that made the company a tidy sum of cash. It was quickly followed by the SNES Classic Edition – not to mention similar products from the likes of Sega, Konami, SNK and Sony – and more recently we've seen the A500 Mini hit store shelves.\nOur friends over at GamesIndustry.biz have been breaking down some data provided by GfK to see how these unique pieces of hardware have fared in the UK marketplace. It should come as no great shock to learn that Nintendo takes the top two places thanks to the SNES and NES Classic Editions, while Sony's much-maligned PlayStation Classic is in third. Sega's excellent Mega Drive / Genesis Mini is in fourth place, followed by the Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros, which is included in this list by the virtue of it being a 'retro' console.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Chinatown Detective Agency is a point and click adventure game that takes place in Singapore in the year 2037. It follows a young detective named Amira Darma as she starts up her agency to solve cases. While futuristic Singapore has secrets hiding at every corner, the case she ends up working on takes her all over the world. I spoke with Mark Fillon, creative director at General Interactive Co., about the inspiration behind the game’s themes, characters, and scope.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are plenty of space exploration games that take after Elite. It's only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they're often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it's not only good, it's doing things completely differently.\nIt's a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I'd be very surprised if you don't enjoy it.\nRead more",

Also I complain about how there are too many Marvel heroes now and they need to kill a load of them off. Plus, in exciting news Nate manages to do his first ever accurate impression, by accident. Stick around for another near miss for Matthew in this week's Cavern Of Lies.\nRead more",

          "description": "Smilegate’s formerly mega-popular RPG Lost Ark receives its April update, the dramatic sounding Battle For The Throne Of Chaos today, bringing with it a new class, continent and a rewards system for those who love the grind.\r\n\n\r\nGlaivier is the new advanced class and she’s proper into orchestral djent judging by the trailer. The Glaivier features two skill sets, Focus and Flurry, linked to one of the ridiculously huge pointy sticks she wields: spear for fast attacks in Focus and glaive for sweeping hits in Flurry. Smilegate say a successful Glaivier can maximise their effectiveness by building up energy with one skill set for a stat boost when swapping to the other. It looks like she can really tear things up with superfast twizzles and dazzly stabbiness.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not in the sense that is has nothing left to give, but that it feels ready to give even more. It's a rip-roaring blast through a cyberscape that doubles as a skatepark for your chainsaw leg. And amidst the sick grinds and spilling of guts you're drip fed weapons and power-ups that only serve to keep the momentum ticking over. You won't concentrate on anything harder in your lifetime.

Previously, the only way to update the wireless controller was the plug it into an actual PS5 – not a problem if you’ve managed to find one in stock, of course, but bad news if you bought the pad standalone to play on your PC.\r\n\n\r\nPer Sony’s announcement tweet, you can download the app directly from the PlayStation site. 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11 are both supported, and using it is pretty easy: just connect the controller via its USB cable and click through a full steps. The single catch is you can only update one controller at a time.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a cute conceit and fun, especially because it treats the virtual tabletop as a physical space. Your own farm animal cards will unhelpfully jostle your setup as they roam, for example, and invading monster cards will chase your villager cards across the tabletop. It's all very pleasant, a little adventure to figure out how it all works then reach the end.\nRead more",

          "description": "It gets easier every day to find out which games will simply run on a Steam Deck; the list of Steam Verified-rated games is regularly extending, and SteamDB are keeping track of Playable and Unsupported games as well. Still, while these may be old favourites that you’ve already sunk hours into on a desktop, you might still be wondering how these games play when transplanted to the smaller screen and gamepad-ish controls of a handheld. \r\n\n\r\nLiam was wondering it, anyway. Thus, he picked ten difference game genres from the most-played on Steam, asked me to play at least one game that would broadly represent each, and report back on which are the most (and least) suited to life on the Steam Deck.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "On paper, Panic's Playdate doesn't have a lot to do with PC. It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.\nIt's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for. \nRead more",

There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway. I climbed back down and did my best to engage with the expensive cutscenes filled with proper actors. 50 hours of mediocre Strange Days references later, I had most of the game under my belt and was ready to go searching for something more substantial - to try to find some actual cyberpunk in this retrowave moodboard. I set about pushing Cyberpunk 2077 to the vertical limit.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. \nI’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets. \nRead more",

This process is, currently, one in suspended animation, and has been for longer than I anticipated. I moved just before the release and my PC is still somewhere in or about the Irish Sea. Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.\nI was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.\nRead more",

But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.\nI am extra delighted by the animals, though.

This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.\r\n\n\r\nIn a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.\nRead more",

Blizzard had a big week, announcing the new World of Warcraft expansion Dragonflight (we have previews of it here and here) as well as detailing the character reworks coming in the Overwatch 2 beta. A Ghostbusters VR game was announced from Sony Pictures and nDreams, the new TMNT brawler has a release window, and Volition finally showed off Saints Row's suite of character customizations. On top of all of that huge news, one of our team has a big day today.\nOur very own Dan Tack is leaving Game Informer today after over eight years on the team, and moving on to a new adventure that he will share at a later date.

As a robed figure, you must unite a population shunned by the gods by restoring their primary connection: language.\nThe core of the experience involved decoding ancient languages to communicate with the Tower of Babel's silent residents and solve puzzles. The reveal trailer also showed off more traditional environmental puzzle-solving as well as some stealth; Chants of Sennar is a war of words, rather than fists. The game’s sharp art direction and a relaxing soundtrack lend the game both a soothing and mysterious atmosphere. \n\n\nChants of Sennaar is slated to arrive in 2023 for Switch and PC.",

Episode one saw an exciting introduction to both the iconic Spartans and the brutal Covenant forces that seek to tear humanity apart. \nBut then we got weeks of melodrama and ill-paced storylines that made us question if we wanted to continue with the show. Episode five, titled \"Reckoning,\" is a stark reminder of why this series has so much potential, and we're breaking it all down on this special edition of The Game Informer Show!\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Andrew Reiner as they bring on Kate Sanchéz, EIC and entertainment critic for But Why Tho?, to discuss and spoil the fantastic battle and more from this week's entry in the Paramount Plus series. We start the proceedings off by gauging Kate's level of enjoyment for the show and blow through some of the other less exciting plot points to get to the good stuff.\nWe also touch on the thankfully brief encounters with Soren and Kwan as they trek through the desert, en route to Madrigal. While that storyline continues to suffer, it wasn't much of a deterrent, as the panel all walked away from this week's show excited for what's to come.\nProgramming Note: Our Episode six review will premiere on Monday, May 1, instead of the regular Friday timeslot. This is due to a particular video editor and his need to take a vacation. We appreciate your patience and look forward to continuing the series review!\nWhat do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

As for how this fight plays into the actual battle royale that is Call of Duty: Warzone, that remains unclear. Save for one of the Warzone planes going down after being grabbed out of the sky by King Kong, the soldiers we play as in the game are nowhere to be seen.\nYou can check out the teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nOperation Monarch will go live on May 11, but hopefully before then, we learn more about how Godzilla and King Kong will actually affect Call of Duty: Warzone. Perhaps they’ll replace the ever-enclosing circle, or perhaps they’ll just be fighting in the background. Regardless, here’s hoping we get some cool skins and customization options related to the kaiju out of this. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Vanguard review and then read about how a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sequel and new Warzone game are confirmed for 2022.

These three games join the recently-added Sega Genesis games, Altered Beast, ToeJam & Earl, Dynamite Headdy, Sword of Vermilion, and Thunder Force II, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, which was added to the service back in January. You can check out all three new Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack games in the trailer below: \n\n\nSpace Harrier II\nSpace Harrier II was first released in 1988 and was one of the original launch titles for the Mega Drive (what the Sega Genesis was known as in Japan) and one of the six Sega Genesis launch titles in the U.S. Nintendo says Space Harrier II is “a celebrated launch title for the Genesis/Mega Drive,” and that “in this sequel to the popular 3D shoot-em-up, Harrier takes to the skies once more to defend Fantasy Land from a mysterious invader.” \nShining Force II\nShining Force II is a tactical RPG released in 1993 and while it is a sequel for the franchise, it’s not a direct sequel to the first shining force. Nintendo says this “second entry in the popular tactical-RPG series” features “even more strategic combat.” In it, “Sir Astral’s squire, Bowie, must assemble an army of light from all the world’s races to stop evil from overtaking the land.” \nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball\nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball is the first of the pinball-related spinoffs in the Sonic franchise. Originally released for the Mega Drive in 1993, Nintendo says “the world’s fastest hedgehog bursts onto the pinball scene in an all-new adventure,” and that “in this action pinball game anyone can pick up and enjoy, gather the Chaos Emeralds, and save four worlds from Dr. Robotnik.” \nAre you excited about any of these Sega Genesis games?

The company announced today a popular Borderlands spinoff is returning this year with the return of Tales from the Borderlands.\nIn a tweet this afternoon from the Borderlands official Twitter account, it was revealed that Tales from the Borderlands would be receiving a second season, and Gearbox only lists it and 2K Games as being attached to the project. The tweet reads, \"There are more stories to explore in the Borderlands universe. An all-new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficail and @2K. Stay tuned for a full announcement this summer.\" The message came with a piece of art featuring three characters under the Borderlands logo with a big moon shining in the background.\nThere are more stories to explore in the #Borderlands universe. An all new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficial and @2K.\npic.twitter.com/xsFbRZ5eHo\nApril 21, 2022\nThe previous developer for season one of Tales of the Borderlands, Telltale Games, isn't mentioned in the announcement, which makes sense as that company has taken more of a publishing role since it was shuttered and resurrected over the past few years. It's unknown whether this new edition of Tales from the Borderlands will continue on with characters from the first season or move on to other stories within the universe. \nSeason one of Tales of the Borderlands is an adventure game following the exploits of former Hyperion employee Rhys and con artist Fiona in the rough yet humorous world of Pandora. You can read why former Game Informer editor Javy Gwaltney loves this game in this opinion piece describing how it's his favorite entry in the entire Borderlands series.

It combined two things that, on paper, should have never worked – Final Fantasy and similar RPG elements with Disney characters and worlds – but somehow, it clicked, and fans fell in love with this creative mix. \nWith 20 years of history behind it, beloved characters (both original and Disney’s), and more reminders of the importance of friendship and heart than in any other series, it’s hard to ignore the impact Kingdom Hearts has made in the gaming community. With that much history, though, comes plenty of highs and lows, and there are clear standouts as a result. The Game Info…",

The game is a multiplayer take on Level-5 and Studio Ghibli’s whimsical universe made by developer Netmarble, and you can pre-register for free on mobile devices beginning today. \n\n\nCross Worlds boasts a new story and the signature Studio Ghibli animation style from the first two titles (the game is made in Unreal Engine 4). The narrative centers on the player character, who hails from a futuristic city, playing what they believe to be a virtual reality game called Soul Divers. However, they discover the fantasy world they’ve entered is very much real, and a mysterious girl named Rania tasks you with rebuilding her world’s kingdom to save both of your realities. \nPlayers suit up as one of five classes: Swordsman, Witch, Engineer, Rogue, and Destroyer. You’ll explore an expansive world filled with NPCs to befriend and monsters to slay, as well as collect Familiars that can be tamed to fight alongside you. The Kingdom can be built up and decorated using interactive objects along with maintaining your own personal farm. Multiplayer includes both PvE and PvP modes.  \nPre-registering on the App Store or Google Play gets you the Explorer’s Outfit. Joining the game’s Discord nets you the Catarumpus Hat and a special title. \nNi no Kuni: Cross Worlds is slated to release stateside on iOS and Android in early summer.

Publisher Dotemu also brings exciting news that the Turtles' original voice actors from the 1987 cartoon reprise their roles in Shredder’s Revenge.

The rest of us will have to wait to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

This will be the first time these cyberpunk-fantasy RPGs have ever been released on console, having been previously exclusive to PC. The trilogy includes three games, as the name suggests: the original PC game, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director’s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition, all fully remastered. \n\n\n“The Shadowrun Trilogy, a remastered release of the Shadowrun Returns RPGs originally released by Harebrained Schemes, has been updated for a console experience, with upscaled graphics, improved performance, and controller-optimized gameplay,” a press release reads. “All three titles in the series will launch simultaneously for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and are available for preorder on all platforms as of today.” \nShadowrun Returns was originally funded via Kickstarter in just 28 hours, and it was the first Kickstarter-funded game to launch after raising more than $1 million on the fundraising platform, according to the press release. Shadowrun Returns, and the rest of the trilogy, is based on the Shadowrun tabletop RPG created by Jordan Weisman, who also helped design Shadowrun Returns. \nShadowrun Trilogy will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on June 21 and it will cost $39.99. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s reviews of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. \nAre you excited for this remastered release of the Shadowrun Trilogy?

Johnson will produce the film on behalf of Seven Bucks Production, alongside Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia, and dj2 Entertainment will help produce it as well. \n\n\nVariety reports that its sources say that Johnson could also star in the film, but that’s obviously not official yet. As expected, this film adaptation of 2021’s It Takes Two, which won Game Of The Year at The Game Awards 2021 in December, will follow main characters May and Cody who are turned into dolls by their daughter amidst divorce proceedings. May and Cody must work together to explore fantasized areas of their home to regain their bodies while confronting the issues of their relationship.\nIt’s one of the best games of 2021, and you can find out why in Game Informer’s It Takes Two review. The film could shape up to be just as good, based on the team behind it. Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller are adapting the game for the silver screen, according to Variety, and they will also serve as executive producers alongside Hazelight Studios’ Josef Fares, who directed the game version of It Takes Two. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s It Takes Two review and then check out our thoughts on Fares’ other games, like A Way Out and Brothers – A Tale Of Two Sons. \n[Source: Variety]\nAre you excited about a film adaptation of It Takes Two?

When Across The Spider-Verse was previously revealed, it was shown to be a Part I, with Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Part II slated to release after it. More specifically, it’s dated for March 29, 2024. \nAs for why this delay has happened, that remains unclear. Sony hasn’t stated why Across The Spider-Verse Part I has been delayed. However, considering we’re in a pandemic, it’s possible the delay is related to COVID-19, which has caused delays across the movie industry, games industry, and more. Or perhaps, more simply, the filmmaking team needs more time. \nInto The Spider-Verse made roughly $375 million worldwide at the box office and considering the franchise is even more popular now than it was upon release, there’s a good chance Across The Spider-Verse easily eclipses that. Only time will tell, though. \nDeadline’s report also states that Sony’s other animated movie, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile has moved up from its Nov. 18 date to Oct. 7, taking Across The Spider-Verse’s original release date. Elsewhere in Sony’s somewhat disjointed Spider-Man-related universe, Madame Web, which will star Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney and Fifty Shades Of Grey’s Dakota Johnson, has received a July 7, 2023 release date. \nWhile waiting for Across The Spider-Verse, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review to find out why it’s a great Spider-Man game, and then check out the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that.

          "description": "Earlier this week, a leaked release date of July 29 for the long-awaited Digimon Survive made the rounds on gaming websites and social media. Today, Bandai Namco made it official.\nIn a succinct video message, Digimon Survive producer Kazumasa Habu confirmed the July date, which appears to be the worldwide release given that pre-orders are now live on retail sites. Check out his message below. \n\n\nThe release confirmation ends a long wait for Digimon fans; Survive was first announced in 2018 with a 2019 release window. The turn-based strategy game stars a group of teens who find their way to the Digital World, and their respective Digimon partners, during a school camping trip. Goggles-wearing protagonist Takuma Momozuka and his buddy Agumon lead this gang to rescue the world from an unknown threat. You can watch the recent English teaser trailer here. \nDigimon Survive will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "If you've ever wanted to be a Ghostbuster (and let's be honest, we all have), a new game from the minds at VR studio nDreams is bringing specter hunting to Meta Quest 2 to help you fulfill that fantasy. \nnDreams, the developers behind VR experiences like Phantom: Covert Ops, Fracked, and Far Cry VR: Dive Into Insanity is partnering with Sony Pictures Virtual Reality to make Ghostbusters VR (working title) virtually a reality. This new Ghostbusting experience will let you team up with up to three friends in VR to track down the paranormal and blast them with your Proton Packs to trap them and take them back to your HQ. Players will run that headquarters in San Francisco, a city never explored in the Ghostbusters franchise. nDreams is promising an \"expansive and engrossing\" campaign that can be played alone or in co-op.\n\n\nThe trailer released today, while an in-engine cinematic, is not actual gameplay, but there are some hints as to what the game may look like when it's released, including fun character customizations like the cute animal hat worn by one of the 'Busters. \nThere's no date on when the now-called Ghostbusters VR will hit Meta Quest 2, but a press release claims more information will become available in the coming months. But GBVR isn't the only Ghostbusters game in the works, as Illfonic's Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, an asymmetrical multiplayer title is coming later this year.",

Developer Polyarc announced during the Meta Quest Showcase today that Moss II would arrive on the platform this summer.\nMoss II on Meta Quest 2 will have more freedom in the way it's played, according to Polyarc. The move to a newer headset like the Quest allows players to utilize both Quest controllers as opposed to a single DualShock controller like in the PS5/PS4 edition. Polyarc says it lets players perform actions such as engaging with the weapon inventory system during combat.\n“One of the first things we heard when we launched Moss: Book II on PlayStation VR a few weeks ago was that the Quest 2 community wanted to play it, and we’re going to deliver on that in the very near future,” said Polyarc CEO Tam Armstrong, in a press release shared with Game Informer. “Our goal from day one has been getting the Moss franchise onto as many headsets as possible. We want all VR players to have the opportunity to experience the joy of physical interaction and power of the emotional resonance we’ve been building into the worlds we create. We’re excited to share our game with millions of Quest 2 players around the world this summer.”\nAn exact release date was not shared for Moss: Book II, but we can't wait to try it out on a Quest 2 sometime this summer. If you want to dig into Moss: Book II and have a PlayStation VR, the game is ready to download and play there.",

It also revealed that the title comes in two editions along with a few pre-order bonus packs. \nThe game’s website shares a chart (pictured above) breaking down each version of the game and various pre-order bonuses. If you’re having trouble making sense of it, we don't blame you. It's confusing at first glance, so here’s a plain breakdown of what it entails. \nThe Standard Edition, which is just the game, costs $39.99. The Digital Deluxe version runs for $44.99 and includes the game plus the following items: \nHard Missions\nLetterbox background\nCharacter animation in main menu\nCamera controls over main menu islands\nCharacter animations during music islands\nExclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles\nWith us so far? Good. Now, there are three content packs, two of which are unavailable for purchase at the moment. They are: \nStart Dash Pack (included with digital pre-orders of Standard or Digital Deluxe Editions)\n100 Medallion bonus\nMirror Mode unlocked\nLetterbox background (Genesis/Mega Drive Pattern)\nPremium & Classic Sound Packs (Coming soon)\nExclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles\nPremium Fun Pack (Coming soon)\nHard missions\nLetterbox background\nCharacter animation in main menu\nCamera controls over main menu islands\nCharacter animations during music islands\nBasically, the Classic Sound and Fun Packs are just the bonuses included in the Digital Deluxe edition but slightly divided. Hopefully that helped you figure out what you're getting and where. \nSonic Origins launches June 23 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

That’s right; you can finally smash through Sonic 1’s Marble Zone as Knuckles. \nIf you’d rather keep it vintage, a Classic Mode lets players enjoy these games in their original forms. Conversely, Anniversary Mode features a full-screen display and infinite lives for those who want to tour each adventure stress-free. Sonic Origins incentivizes gameplay with new in-game missions that reward medallions. Spending this currency in the game’s Vault unlocks new content and grants access to a Special Stage. Origins also sports new cutscenes in the style of Sonic Mania's animated cinematics.\n\n\nSonic Origins launches on June 23 – Sonic’s 31st birthday – on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The Standard Edition runs for $39.99, but there are two versions and a few content packs you can read all about here. \nTo learn more about Sonic the Hedgehog's history, check out our June 2021 interview with Sonic Team's leader Takashi Iizuka about Sonic Origins as well as the franchise's 30-year history here.",

          "description": "Skydance New Media, the studio helmed by famed writer Amy Hennig, has announced it partnered with Lucasfilm Games to develop a new Star Wars title.\nThe upcoming game is described in a press release as a “richly cinematic action-adventure game” that will feature an original story. That’s about all there is in terms of details, as the project appears very early in development. \n“I’ve often described how seeing Star Wars in 1977 essentially rewired my 12-year-old brain, shaping my creative life and future indelibly,” said Hennig in the press release. “I’m elated to be working with Lucasfilm Games again to tell interactive stories in this galaxy that I love.”\nHennig, best known as the chief creative mind behind the Uncharted series, is no stranger to working on the Star Wars license. Her last foray into the universe was EA’s ill-fated Project Ragtag, the canceled Star Wars title by the now-defunct Visceral Games.  \nThis marks the second major project for Skydance New Media, which was formed in 2019. Last October, Hennig announced her team was developing an original story-focused action-adventure Marvel game as its first title. We still don’t know anything about that game either, but having now two major Disney properties under its belt are big gets for the young studio. \nNow that the Star Wars license is no longer exclusive to EA, this new project joins the pile of several upcoming games from a variety of studios. Quantic Dreams’ Star Wars Eclipse was announced last December, and Ubisoft’s mysterious open-world game hasn't made a peep since its announcement last year.",

Earlier this year, a scoreboard detailing ribbon progression, match stats, and more was finally implemented. And while there’s a list of features the community would like to see added to Dice’s frenetic shooter, VOIP (voice over internet protocol) has remained somewhere near the top. In today’s Battlefield 2042’s update, 4.0, limited voice chat options have been introduced.\nBut what does ”limited” mean? According to the official EA/Battlefield website, there are now “two voice chat channels to choose between: Party and Squad. Settings for VoIP can be adjusted via Options > Sound/Voice > Chat while in-game.” Sadly, you won’t be able to communicate with your whole team just yet, but this is definitely a solid start. Moreover, a Scoreboard UI refresh hit 2042 servers. Finally, a ton of weapon attachements, matchmaking/social, progression//unlocks, maps, and player character changes have been made for a more streamlined action experience. You can read through the extensive amount of fixes here.\nAre you still playing Battlefield 2042? What’s your experience been like over the past few months?",

          "description": "A new report from Bloomberg states that Sega is developing big-budget reboots of two of its most popular Dreamcast games: Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. \nAccording to the Bloomberg report, which cites “people familiar with its [Sega’s] plans,” Sega is developing these reboots looking to tap into its back catalog in search of a hit like Fortnite. These two reboots could be the first of Sega’s Super Game initiatives that it announced last November. \nThis begs the question: why is Sega looking to Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio to be a Fortnite? Fortnite is a battle royale with plenty of crossover opportunities thanks to its live events and multitudes of outfits, and it’s free, which certainly lends to its popularity. Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are decidedly not like Fortnite, but perhaps Sega has more drastic plans for these reboots. Bloomberg also reports that Sega’s European studio is working on a first-person Super Game, so maybe that is the title Sega hopes to become its own Fortnite-like hit. \nThe Crazy Taxi reboot has been in development for more than a year, and Sega plans to release it in the next two to three years. Jet Set Radio is also early in development, and the publication’s sources say both games could still be canceled. \nFor the uninitiated, Crazy Taxis is a zany quasi-racing title where players are tasked with transporting passengers across town in a high-speed taxi, all while tracks from The Offspring (and others) play. On the other hand, Jet Set Radio is a game about rollerblading and graffiti, with flashy visuals in an area not unlike the shopping districts of Tokyo and a soundtrack that rips.\nBoth Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are beloved by their fans, so here’s hoping these reboots come to fruition as games we can all play one day. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWould you be excited about a Crazy Taxi or Jet Set Radio reboot?
