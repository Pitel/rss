          "description": "Prime example.\nIt’s difficult to believe now, but there was once a time when the notion of a first-person Metroid game seemed unfathomable. Prior to the release of Metroid Prime back in 2002, the franchise had been confined to the 2D realm, with complex environments full of secrets and hidden equipment that bolstered your abilities and combat potential as you explored. The idea that Retro Studios, an entirely new entity at the time, could not only successfully reimagine the franchise in a 3D space but also implement a first-person perspective was frankly absurd. Yet the team accomplished it spectacularly, crafting what remains to this day one of the finest GameCube games of all time.\nNow, more than 20 years later, Metroid Prime has been remastered for the Nintendo Switch, and Retro Studios has proven why it’s consistently considered one of the most talented developers in the business (though the studio did have help from a number of other devs for this one). This is a stunning revamp from top to bottom, and although there are a few minor niggles here and there, we feel confident enough to say that Metroid Prime Remastered is a bonafide masterpiece and an absolutely essential addition to your Switch library.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt. At least they’re being honest.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.\nAll of those parts are present, and as a bonus it's incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.\nOf all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.\nRead more",

When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.\nRead more",

It's nice that witches have changed in our minds to \"unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]\", when they used to be \"unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil\".\nThere's still room for witches with some threat to 'em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It's a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. \"In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,\" solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. \"During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one's home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house.\"\nRead more",

I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.\nI thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it's actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain's Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.\nRead more",

Developer Poncle announced the new 1.3 Chaos Update is coming to Vampire Survivors on all systems tomorrow, February 9th. The Chaos Update brings a new challenge stage, two relics, and more features to the bullet-hell indie, but some fans are convinced the 1.3 update is actually an homage to Sonic The Hedgehog. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a 19th-century witch sim being made by Emberstorm Entertainment, where you play as a traveling witch whose chosen mode of transportation is the legendary chicken-legged Baba Yaga house, which is the coolest thing ever.\r\n\nDetails on Reka are still super light, and the Steam page mentions a release year of 2024, but I’ve been following Emberstorm’s Twitter intently, looking at all the cool gifs for Reka and the house looks incredible! For one, it’s huge. It towers above the forest trees and looks like it could easily stomp unwanted visitors to death. When the young witch approaches the towering beast, it bends is legs to sit down, almost burring itself in the earth for her access to the house on top.\nRead more",

Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. \r\n\n\r\nAs I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We originally thought the nail-biting roguelike would see a 1.0 release this month, but developer Red Hook haven't left us empty-handed. Darkest Dungeon 2 currently has a demo available on Steam and the Epic Games Store until the end of Steam Next Fest on February 13th. Red Hook say the demo will feature the four starting heroes as you take them around one full region and explore either the Sprawl (city) or the Foeter (farms.) \r\n\n \nRead more",

People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you're approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That's all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.\nRead more",

Promise.\nBut! After my first match, the following 30 hours vanished quicker than the Galaxy Caramels in a box of Celebrations. I became obsessed. I mastered AOE II's low AI difficulties and quickly used the Advanced Techniques tutorial to learn build orders. Before I knew it, I had a Google Doc filled with step-by-step plans for various playstyles, the perfect strategies for any scenario. But that Google Doc ended up ruining everything for me. If that recent Xbox release with the good gamepad controls has you tempted to revisit Age Of Empires II on PC, do not make a Google Doc. You’ve been warned.\nRead more",

The goal is to wall up areas to hold water, and doing a good job rewards you with ducks. I think we can all agree that ducks are a pretty great reward. They’re like chill geese that won’t drag your child away.\nIf Wetrix was easily overlooked, its 2000 sequel blended in with the carpeting.

Players simultaneously attempt to match cards in their deck with the top card in a central pool — constantly pulling from a side deck in a bid to be the first to deplete all cards in hand. It's simpler than yer boy is making it sound, but perhaps not so much when presented in Japanese by shouting anime characters\nDeal yourself a hand in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber edzvision.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_dVkoBuOrM&ab_channel=edzvision\nMagical Speed, which was generally presented in cocktail cabinet form, follows the rules of the tabletop classic but adds cutesy characters and a thin \"adventure\" storyline, as a hero makes their way through a fantasy kingdom, taking on a variety of opponents. As this Arcade Archives release represents the Japanese ROM, there is no English localization, although an English manual is included. While perhaps the nichest Arcade Archives release in some time, this obscure oddity is worth a look for traditional card game fans. Who knows, you might end up searching for cocktail cabinets on eBay.\nMagical Speed is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Obscure card title Magical Speed plays its hand to the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s shaping up to be – how do I put this politely? – a game.\nHoly Ocean is described as an open-world FPS where you explore an ocean of meat on a bicycle. Along the way, you discover islands that look like human body-parts while fighting creatures and bosses. It sounds like Rose, a side character from Golden Light and protagonist of the side-story, Golden Light of Rose, will play a central role. The world is said to be “handmade” and “fully destructible.”\n[embed]https://youtu.be/YuYipiUeXjk[/embed]\nMr. Pink has been noodling around with a few concepts lately. He’s shown off a bit of Holy Ocean previously under the name “Goldendola.” Aside from that, Mech Punk is another unique one available on Steam Early Access. He’s also demonstrated a concept for a dog-walking RPG. Sounds like a good way to stretch yourself thin, but Mech Punk gets updated so often, I don’t know how he has time to sleep. I guess a person needs to keep themselves occupied after fleeing Russia.\nGolden Light was one of my favorite games released in 2022. The dark-weird, meatpunk style of Mr. Pink is an aesthetic I can get behind, so I’ve been keeping an eye on what’s being worked on.\nHoly Ocean is available to be wishlisted on Steam.

          "description": "I just called...\nGood morning, friends, and welcome to this week's edition of Whatcha Been Playing? It will be something of a shorter affair this time around, as I'm still technically off work — an endeavor that I have only been somewhat successful in maintaining. But, even when I'm not supposed to be here, I'm still gonna rock up for WBP? Not only is each and everyone one of you more than worth the time and effort, but, hey, I got a streak to maintain. So thanks for showing out this Saturday, and here's to a fine week for you all.\nto say...\nPlaying games for review. I guess that still counts as work, right? But time, tide, and embargoes wait for no man, and thus I've been bouncing between two games in lieu of upcoming reviews. The first is 110 Industries' silly slasher Wanted: Dead, which you can read all about next week, while the second is Inti Creates rat-a-tat-tat anime actioner Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, which is still a little ways away. I have much to say about both of these titles. Still, I'm afraid you'll have to hang on for the obligatory designated timestamp to pass before I can spill the beans on these particularly unique releases.\nI love you...\nAnywhoooo, I only have a mere two days left on my holiday — a holiday that has whizzed by at ungrateful speed — and thus I better get to trying to enjoy them. I will, of course, be sure to dive into all of your comments, so join the point and tell the community Whatcha Been Playing? There's sure been a lot of news and excitement so far this year, and hopefully, you've found something to get your gaming brain in gear for 2023. Tell us all about it, and share your thoughts. The World wants to hear it. And if it doesn't, we'll just force 'em to listen anyway. We Shall Not Be Denied.\nHave a wonderful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.\nThe post Whatcha been playing this week, Destructoid? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "2 Player Productions delves into the PsychOdyssey of Psychonauts 2\nThe collaboration that created Double Fine Adventure is back with a new documentary. Today, 2 Player Productions and Double Fine Productions premiered Double Fine PsychOdyssey, a detailed documentary following the development of Psychonauts 2.\nUp on both YouTube and the Internet Archive, Double Fine PsychOdyssey is 32 episodes long, with some pretty hefty runtimes. Alongside following the development of Psychonauts 2, there's also a mini-movie in the middle following Amnesia Fortnight, the studio's special brainstorming and prototyping event it holds every so often.\nMuch like Double Fine Adventure did with the development of Broken Age, Double Fine PsychOdyssey looks to be a pretty deep and also human look into the creation of a game. You can see a little bit of it in the trailer here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlI72bsNRc\nMaking the game\nIt's good to see transparency in how games are made, and how the people who make them go through the process. You'd be hard-pressed to find as interesting a subject as Double Fine, too.\nThe development of Psychonauts 2 took a while, and a lot happened for Double Fine over the course of it. Getting a look into how those events panned out, as well as how the team tackled making a sequel to the original Psychonauts, certainly sounds like it would be an interesting watch.\nMost of the Double Fine PsychOdyssey episodes are pretty long, so settle in for a watch. But hey, with the weekend ahead, it seems like a great time to settle in and watch a game get made. Find all of the episodes in the playlist here.\nThe post A new Double Fine documentary following Psychonauts 2 is out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

The press release tells me that this date is significant because it’s Ash Wednesday, but as a Canadian, that just tells me that February 21st is Pancake Tuesday.\nI probably lost a fair few of you at the word “Mobile,” but it’s necessary to highlight this game for a very important reason: Yangyang Mobile is the developer that brought us Perfect Gold, a game that came out in 2021 that I still haven’t shut up about.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/pcLijhOfBbI[/embed]\nHowever, while Perfect Gold was a beautiful yuri love story, Saint Maker has its sights set on horrifying you rather than warming your heart. It tells the story of Holly Beltran, who is attending a recollection at Saint Idelora’s convent when she starts witnessing strange hauntings. Saint Maker revolves around religious horror with a psychological twist. While there are interactive choices to be made, Yangyang Mobile has pegged the game at around 60,000 words and estimates it will take 4-6 hours to complete. Great information!\nWhile I would have been perfectly content if Yangyang Mobile wanted to keep feeding me yuri romance, I’m down for a little variety. This isn't their first foray into the horror genre, as they previously released The Letter in 2017.\nSaint Maker will be available on PC and Switch on February 22nd.

Now, Team Fortress 2 has had many summer updates, and the last few have been largely focused on items. But according to Valve, this one's a bit different.\n\"The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates. But this year, we're planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update — with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!\"\n\nSo yes, a full-on update is on the way for Team Fortress 2. Submissions for the Steam Workshop portion are open up to May 1, for this summer-situated (but not necessarily summer-themed) update.\nBack to the fort\nTeam Fortress 2 is arguably a herald of a genre that would become the team-based hero shooter, adding individual skills and characters to a team-focused FPS contest. The result was a classic that garnered many, many fans over the years.\nStill, the game languished over time, and last year fans rallied for a #SaveTF2 campaign, calling for Valve to address the botting issues that had run rampant through Team Fortress 2. Valve did respond, and started to take steps towards fixing the issues.\nNow, Team Fortress 2 fans may actually have a new update to look forward to. I'm interested to see how large of an update this will be, but it's at least a pulse of life that might draw some lapsed fans back into the realm of Team Fortress 2.\nThe post Valve is working on a ‘full-on update-sized update’ for Team Fortress 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it wasn't shown in the English-language Direct, Koei Tecmo America has launched a site saying that the remake will arrive this summer. We reached out and a Koei Tecmo representative confirmed that this summer is the worldwide release window.\nHere's the trailer from yesterday's Direct:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAfHby0zw74\nThe original Atelier Marie was the first in the now long-running Atelier series.

It follows Marie's quest to create something outstanding, to stand out in her class.\nBack to the origin\nWith the Atelier series seeming to pick up steam in the west with each new entry, it's neat to see Koei Tecmo return to its roots. While Atelier Marie has seen many ports over the years, this starting slice of the series hasn't seen an official North American release yet.\nFor fans of the workshop-driven RPG series, this could be a good chance to see how it all started, but with a fresh update and look that adheres closer to recent entries like Ryza and Sophie.\nMeanwhile, Atelier Ryza 3 was originally slated to arrive this month. But the team recently announced it's taking a one-month delay and pushing the third entry in Ryza's adventure back to March 24.\nThe post Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg arrives this summer appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'm always down for more rhythm games, but I'm especially fond of titles that recontextualize the music found in other games. I think nearly every video game would benefit from a supplemental mechanical examination of its soundtrack.\nBut obviously, some franchises are more suited to rhythm gaming than others. If I were to make a list of the greatest video game series soundtracks of all time, it would probably include Metroid and Halo, but those scores aren't exactly full of toe-tappers.

Send in the name of the object of your derision via a Google Survey I’ll link below before February 13th. All of the names will be collected and dropped into and upcoming preview update. Then, on Valentine’s Day, the Beetos that spawn will be renamed with monikers from the list of ex-lovers.

Return to Castlevania makes the assumption that you’ve been there in the first place and takes The Prisoner to the world of Castlevania. There, you’ll team up with Richter Belmont and Alucard to take down Death and Dracula.\nConsidering that Dead Cells owes part of its “RogueVania” design to the seminal Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the crossover seems like a great fit. Not only that, but Konami and GuruGuru recently lifted a portion of Dead Cells design for GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon. First comes love, then comes marriage.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/ZSZ0qY6FRgw[/embed]\nThe trailer shows off the inspiration. Music, locations, bosses, and weapons have all been lifted from the surrogate franchise and transplanted into Dead Cells. The lo-fi visuals really fit well with the Castlevania flavor. The appearance of Alucard and Richter is a welcome treat for fans like myself, and the boss battle against Dracula really takes me into Castlevania’s weird image of Romania.\nI played a bit of Dead Cells as a point of reference for when I was playing GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon. Since I’m such a huge Castlevania fan, the Return to Castlevania DLC might be just what I need to dive further into it.\nDead Cells is available on mobile, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

Sometimes, the Japanese Nintendo Direct will have previews of games that eventually release worldwide. During yesterday's show, there were a couple of games in it that didn't show up in the western versions, including a new entry in the My Summer Vacation series.\nGoogle-translated as Natsu-mon 20th Century Summer Vacation, the game puts players in the shoes of a ten-year-old boy as he celebrates a month of summer in a quiet seaside town. Like with other My Summer Vacation games, the boy will be able to catch fish and bugs to track in his journal. He'll also be able to take a train to another town, help out with a circus troupe, and visit a night market. Unlike past games in the franchise, this one won't rely on pre-rendered screens.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW4Fsbty6Ls\nIt is an absolute toss-up as to whether or not Natsu-mon 20th Century Summer Vacation will make it out of Japan. Last year, curious westerns were thrown a bone with the worldwide release of Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey-. While the Shin-chan character designs might have been a turn-off for those who don't care for the series, the gameplay was a delightfully laid-back experience.

          "description": "2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. \nThe series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it. \n\n\nFor more on Psychonauts 2, you can read our review of the game here. Be sure to also check out editor Blake Hester's 2021 feature about the entire history of Double Fine Productions.",

I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response.

In 2017, a spin-off starring Layton's daughter called Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy was released for 3DS and was ported to Switch in 2019.",

There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. \n“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nForspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.",

After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.\nIn that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix.

Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.\nDarkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.\nHeroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. \nYou can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Her other credits include Netflix's Jupiter's Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked \"all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,\" thanking them for \"acknowledging and validating the power of game music.\" \n\n\nVariety also reports that prior to this year's Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show's score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012's Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. \nEconomou's Grammy was awarded during the main show's pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game's name last night is any indication. \ncan’t stop laughing at this guy announcing the Grammy win for Assassin's Creed Valhalla pic.twitter.com/vz9bTVZFTX\nFebruary 5, 2023\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our impressions of its Dawn of Ragnarok expansion. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat video game score should win at next year's Grammys show?

The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

          "description": "Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
