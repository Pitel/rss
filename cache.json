But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\".

It's an \"aggressively random\" response to what the developers call the \"lock-and-key\" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which \"frogs can jump off of other frogs\" and \"delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted\", well, I encourage you to get involved.\r\n \nRead more",

You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass.

The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale \"showdowns\" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

It's an easy two-star recipe you can make in the game for a decent amount of Star Coins.\n\n\nWhere to find Mint Sorbet ingredients in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nTo make Mint Sorbet in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need two ingredients: \n\n\n\nMint\n\n\nSlush Ice\n\n\n\nScreenshots by Destructoid\n\n\nThe herb Mint can be found growing within the Frosted Heights biome. Look at the ground and try to find the herb risen from the ground. It has green leaves and a brown stem. It's easy to find multiple of this resource in the Frosted Heights. \n\n\nSlush Ice is much harder to get as you need to complete Remy's quest The Unknown Flavor, which unlocks after reaching Level 10 friendship with the rat. After finishing this task, you can buy Slush Ice from Remy's Kitchen for 150 Star Coins. \n\n\nWhere to make Mint Sorbet\n\n\nTo make a dish of Mint Sorbet, you'll need to approach a cooking station at your home, Chez Remy, or at another stove, perhaps in Mickey's house. Throw the Mint and the Slush Ice into the pot and use one coal to start the cooking process. After a few seconds, you'll get your hands on the Mint Sorbet. Now you've made a two-star recipe that can help towards some Dreamlight goals. \n\n\nYou can sell the Mint Sorbet for 260 Star Coins or get 695 Energy for consuming the meal.

          "description": "Once Human has a rather large world, and it can be tiring to keep crossing it on foot (or on wheels), so the fast travel teleportation system is a must. However, you may encounter times when you get the message “Start Point Locked.” This is what it means and how to fix it.\n\n\nYou simply need to understand how the fast travel system works in Once Human. You can unlock points to teleport to by activating teleportation towers out in the world. You are also able to teleport to your home base. What is important to remember here is that you can’t just teleport to any available point from anywhere you’re standing. You can only do that at your home base.\n\n\nIf you are simply standing out in the middle of nowhere, you can fast-travel to your home base, but you’re not going to be able to teleport to a teleportation tower. That’s when you’ll see “Start Point Locked.” It is the worst wording possible for the problem. It’s not “Start Point Unsuitable,” which gives you more of an idea that this is a situational issue; it’s “Start Point Locked,” which suggests it's a temporary problem solved by manual intervention. It could even be \"Cannot teleport from present location,\" but here we are.\n\n\nTo fix the “Starting Point Locked” issue, you just need to go to a teleportation tower and use that to teleport to the point where you need to go. You can also go to your home base and teleport from there. The important thing is that you can’t teleport from anywhere. So check your feet before you try to move your seat.\n\nThe post How to fix Once Human start point locked appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, I reckon people will still be modding Skyrim. You just can't stop the unbridled tenacity of gamers.\n\n\nHere's one more for all you hip cats to add to your TES5 loadout.

Check them out in the video above, although it's pretty clear the player is more than capable of dispatching them. Look at all that blood!\n\n\nNin-ja or Nin-nein?\n\n\nThe reason why the Forsworn have been replaced with ninjas is, according to Q10isarobot, because they \"fight kinda like ninjas and hang out in clans so I think it fits well in the game.\" Makes sense, though they do admit they're not a lore expert when it comes to Skyrim.\n\n\nThis also looks like a good mod for anyone who doesn't want to interrupt their current save file. The creator says it just replaces the mesh, so it's \"safe to install or uninstall,\" and also doesn't require an ESP file for expanding scripting.\n\n\nRight. Okay.

It was developed by Rare with very little input from Technos, but they sort of tried to find a mid-point between the two series.

          "description": "Bandai Namco revealed today that the previous PlayStation Vita (yes, that Sony Handheld device) exclusive Action RPG Freedom Wars is celebrating its 10-year anniversary with Freedom Wars Remastered. The HD remaster will feature new and improved features from the Vita version including 4k resolution, 60 FPS, game balance and difficulty options, and updates to the weapon crafting and upgrading systems. Freedom Wars Remastered will be released in just a few months on January 10, 2025, on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.\n\n\n\n\nThe premise of Freedom Wars is simple. In the harsh dystopic world, the game takes place in, your character has been sentenced to a 1,000,000-year prison sentence simply for being born.  To work off your sentence, you must head out into the apocalyptic battlefield and take on colossal creatures called Abductors, killing them to lower your sentence and dismantling their body parts to craft and upgrade better equipment.\n\n\nI put quite a few hours into the original release of Freedom Wars back on the Vita. In fact, it may have been one of my most played games on the platform, as it was one of the better ones. I'd even argue it was ahead of its time back in 2015, in what was essentially a sci-fi Monster Hunter meets Attack on Titan meets Sword Art Online.\n\n\nThere's even online co-op gameplay, and it's fun to team up with friends to take down some Abductors. I'm excited to see the updates to crafting and upgrading, as it could really streamline progression if done right. We'll know soon as enough as Freedom Wars Remastered launches on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam on January 10, 2025. I certainly didn't see this coming, but I'm so glad that it is.\n\nThe post Vita Action RPG Freedom Wars is getting a remastered version for 10th Anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, once you attempt to change it, you may receive a notification to get rid of the station first. \n\n\nIf you are unsure what to do, we'll show you how to remove stations in The Elder Scrolls: Castles.\n\n\nHow do you remove stations in The Elder Scrolls: Castles?\n\n\nYou can remove a station in The Elder Scrolls: Castles by pressing and holding it, triggering a red icon in the bottom-left corner. Then, drag it to the crate icon to get it out of the castle.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFortunately, you won't lose out on the materials, as the station will now be transferred to your inventory. Open the build menu, and you should see an available card for the station.\n\n\nIf you simply want to move the station, you can perform the same interaction of pressing and holding it. This can be useful when you're reorganizing your castle layout or when you want to optimize the placement of your main areas. Just make sure to have enough room available, given that some builds require more space than others.\n\n\nYou can also remove the room itself when in build mode's Room section. Press the left-most symbol with a square symbol, then tap on the area you want to remove. Like the stations, you'll gain the materials again, allowing you to use them elsewhere. The flooring and stairs work the same way, so don't stress about any unused resources.\n\n\nKeep these steps in mind for the future since you'll likely be making more room for the advanced stations. This includes bigger domains like the War Table, Shine of Mara, and Workshop.\n\nThe post How to remove stations in The Elder Scrolls: Castles appeared first on Destructoid.",

WayForward's Clock Tower: Rewind revival is now set to launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC in the Americas and Europe on October 29, 2024.\n\n\nOutside of folks who have played the ROM or watched Shinya Arino brave its horrors on Game Center CX, most westerners likely first encountered the series on PlayStation. WayForward's update takes the Super Famicom classic and breathes new life into its horrifying hallways. The original gameplay is still intact along with the graphics and sound, but now there are some quality-of-life improvements in the mix along with added features. \n\n\nThat fresh content can be found in Rewind mode. There's a new animated intro, as well as functions like save states, rewind (hey, it's in the title!), a music player, art gallery, and vocal songs by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Emi Evans. There's also the aforementioned Clock Tower Commercial Sampler demo for a nice piece of video game history. You can get an idea of how it's shaping up in a recent gameplay video:\n\n\n\n\nIt's very appropriate that Japan gets this one on October 31, but two days earlier ain't bad. Either way, it's the perfect time of the year to spend running like mad from Scissorman. \n\n\nBeyond the Clock Tower update, WayForward set a release window for River City Girls 2's Double Dragon DLC.

          "description": "LEGO Fortnite's Lost Isles is all about finding dinosaurs, exploring the jungle, and fighting against pirates. However, if you search long enough, you might spot a little banana character next to a small village square marker.\n\n\nWhile it may not look like much now, this place known as NaN'er Hamlet or NaNa Village is where most of this area's fun comes from. Here's how to find NaNa Village in LEGO Fortnite.\n\n\nNaNa Village location in LEGO Fortnite\n\n\nThe exact spawn location of NaNa Village, known in-game as NaN'er Hamlet, differs with every world seed. Although the Lost Isles' land masses don't change, the spawn spots for Klombos, various NPCs, and NaNa village do. Although using a set seed will guarantee you find it in the same location every time, looking for it on a random world means you'll have to run around Lost Isle until you spot it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFortunately, there's some good and bad news. The good news is that the actual appearance of the NaN'er Hamlet never changes. The bad news is that it's a small village square statue with one character, Bananthony, next to it. Considering Lost Isles' size, you might have to search for a while. \n\n\nBananthony and the NaNa Village marker can spawn in the jungle, on a beach's coastline, or in random plains biomes around Lost Isle. Although plenty of random buildings will spawn around the area, NaN'er Hamlet is the only place that specifically spawns a village square and Bananthony. Watch for his colorful appearance, the village square structure, and its peculiar dirt patch to help you spot it. Otherwise, you'll need plenty of luck or a custom world seed to make the search easier.\n\n\nOnce you find NaN'er Hamlet, you can speak to Bananthony and interact with the village square marker to begin upgrading this little settlement, much like you would with any other village or the Rebel Outpost from the Star Wars event.\n\nThe post Where to find the NaNa Village in LEGO Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",
