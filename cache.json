          "description": "Gripping.\nIt feels like 3D platformers have come back in a big way these last few years, and some of the most memorable entries have been the most unconventional. Demon Turf utilized a fascinating hand-drawn 2D art style. Tinykin had you leaping and exploring bedrooms and kitchens while commanding a small army of not-Pikmin. Snake Pass tasked you with slithering around as a snake in a platformer without jumping. Super Adventure Hand fits this canon of offbeat 3D platformers like a glove, and though it isn’t an exceptional entry in the genre, it’s so bizarre that we can’t help but suggest you give it a try.\nSuper Adventure Hand begins with the titular appendage going for a woodland stroll before being accosted by the nefarious feet, who knock the hand unconscious and steal the arm it was attached to. You thus set out on a quest across various hand-themed worlds, collecting mugs along the way that (somehow?) aid you in your goal of reclaiming your arm. From the feet.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It may not match the high-speed hijinks of kart racers starring Mario, Crash Bandicoot, or Sonic the Hedgehog, nor does it hit the same destructive highs of Burnout or the high-fidelity, simulative thrill found in other platforms' exclusive driving games, Forza and Gran Turismo. Instead, you just go fast and feel good doing it. In other words, Horizon Chase 2 is arcade-y fun, and good at pretty much exactly what its title implies, though not much more, and it hits some bumps in the road on Switch.\nLike Aquiris' predecessor, Horizon Chase Turbo, Horizon Chase 2 is a throwback to a bygone arcade era; the only thing that matters is that horizon and the finish line that lies somewhere beyond. There's no gimmick or catch. Everything around you becomes a blur as you hit dizzying speeds as you race through low-fidelity courses offering cute renditions of places like Morocco, Japan, the Continental U.S., and Brazil.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When I was a computer science student, I developed a messaging app called HYPE with a few of my (more-talented) peers. It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was \"They stole our idea!\"\nOf course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. \nAnd so it falls to me to tell you that if you don't have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren't, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. \nThis critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply. \nRead more",

My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.\nIf I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.\nRead more",

In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with \"what happens when you survive the un-survivable,\" as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.\n\"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room,\" says Stokalski. \"And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. \nRegardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.

          "description": "During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. \nI was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.\nRead more",

Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. \r\n\n\r\nI've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: \"Totally Fucked\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  \nAs with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.\nRead more",

Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?\r\n\n\r\nThing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake!

          "description": "On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate \"Metascore\" as a kind of \"magic\". The FAQ cheekily invites you to \"peek behind the curtain\", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the \"weighting\" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.\nYou could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've read several comments here and elsewhere that Bethesda's Starfield is \"a mile-wide but deep as a puddle\", or variations on that theme. Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever.\nOr at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles \"an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible\". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, \"What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island.\" To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.\nInstead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.\nBut this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.\nRead more",

It’s an inopportune time for not only those affected, but also for Twitch, which will be hosting its semi-annual TwitchCon at the end of the month.\n\n\nAccording to GamesIndustry.biz, an unnamed source said these layoffs were mostly affecting “the customer experience organization,” and were a result of the company shifting towards an outsourcing business model to fulfill these roles.\n\n\n\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount,\" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, in response to the first round of layoffs in March. Jassy took over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021.\n\n\nThese layoffs come as the next in a long line of industry shakeups, with layoffs at Epic Games, studios associated with Embracer Group such as Beamdog, Crystal Dynamics, and Gearbox Publishing, Team17, Naughty Dog, and Bioware, to name just a few. \n\nThe post Twitch reportedly hit with more layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Mario Bros. Wonder is set to debut on the Switch on October 20, and it's looking incredibly colorful and sleek. But if you're looking for something a little…older, this fan-made commercial should do the trick.\n\n\nStraight from the mind of the YouTube channel Luiz do Comercial, this video is a blast from the past. Aimed at recreating the somber yet powerful aesthetic of 1988, the clip reimagines the modern Super Mario Wonder as a classic NES game. In case you're wondering, yes, they do the \"Now You're Playing with Power\" slogan at the end.\n\n\nIn a fascinating turn, the creator notes that the inspiration came from an unlikely place: a retro remake concept of Mario Wonder by Nimaginendo Games. It also draws upon elements of Mario 2, including the in-game visuals. As Luiz notes: \"This was a very audacious project, because in addition to the 3D and 2D, I had to do all the pixel art for the supposed NES game!\"\n\n\n\n\nThese bits of nostalgia really work on me\n\n\nGiven that I was around for the height of the NES' success in America, these types of fan-made projects speak to me in a big way. This one, in particular, is really spot on, from the hazy '80s/'90s viewing experience to the booming horror-like voiceover effect.\n\n\nIt brings me back to a time when we were constantly advertised to by a faceless void-like entity; before the attitude-ridden '90s came along and changed things considerably. By then, people were on-screen screaming in our faces. Game marketing is a fascinating microcosm of weirdness!\n\n\n[Thanks Rob!]\n\nThe post This fan-made retro-fied Mario Wonder commercial is lovely appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Patch 3 for Baldur's Gate 3 brought many good changes with it. From the expected bug fixes to methods for altering the protagonist's appearance, there's plenty to like. \n\n\nOne less popular addition was giving the Sphynx His Majesty a regretful coat of fur. Until the patch, this rude and pompous cat had an illustrious mane of nothing, adding to his charm, and thankfully the latest hotfix restores this. \n\n\nAmong the first changes noted on the hotfix's page was Larian Studio's wise decision to shave His Majesty. If anything, this hotfix primarily reverses controversial changes made in Patch 3 that fans haven't taken to. \n\n\nA cat who is not His Majesty also saw changes. Another Sphynx named Steelclaw had her eye color adjusted to not be His Majesty's clone.\n\n\nAnother reversal made was with how inventory management occurred. Patch 3 introduced a shared inventory system where party members shared items they deemed important with the player upon dismissal. It proved to be a bit of a headache for players, so Larian reverted the change.\n\n\nNot every change made is a reversal back to the Patch 2 settings. Alongside those are the general bug fixes that help generally improve the game's stability. \n\n\nAmong these are fixing several multiplayer-related crashes, namely when listening to dialogue after a roll and when reassigning characters in splitscreen. Other bugs fixed include preventing invalid saves from being created and Twitch drops not being claimable on PS5. \n\n\nIf there is anything to take away from this hotfix, it's that Larian Studios knows when to back down from a disliked change. His Majesty is as majestic as he is thanks to his lack of fur, and taking that away means taking his character away. May he remain forever rude and furless. \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 hotfix sees His Majesty returned to original, furless glory appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one is a tad bigger than a mere annoyance though, as Pokemon Scarlet & Violet version 2.0.1 (which arrived for the Teal Mask DLC) apparently added in a hardware crash.\n\n\nSo here's how it happens:\n\n\n\nGet to the final battle of the game\n\n\nHave Miraidon or Koraidon (the box cover legendaries) in your Pokedex\n\n\nSelect Pokemon party slots 4-6\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the above video from Twitter user Mattyoukhana_, the bug triggers as soon as you highlight the fourth or sixth party slot. You can move around slots 1-3 all you want, and even swing around the top to the bottom-most entry of your chosen box Pokemon. But once you hit the slot above it, boom, crash.\n\n\nAs the community points out in the ensuing discussion, you can sidestep the bug by not hovering over the aforementioned slots, or by just not having a full party. For those of you who steamroll battles with just one 'Mon, you probably won't even notice it.\n\n\nFolks are flabbergasted as to how this can happen, as this was evidently added to the base campaign, and didn't happen in the new DLC zone. But it wouldn't be a Pokemon game without some puzzling bugs. Ideally, this bug will be spread far and wide, and Game Freak will be able to patch it out at some point. I refrained from typing \"swiftly patch out,\" because this is Game Freak we're talking about.

These maps include: Afghan, Derail, Estate, Favela, Karachi, Highrise, Invasion, Quarry, Rundown, Rust, Scrapyard, Skidrow, Sub Base, Terminal, Underpass, and Wasteland. \n\n\nAccording to the official reveal of Modern Warfare III, all of these maps will be available at launch, though it's unclear if that means they'll all be available in the beta. \n\n\nIt should be noted that, while the multiplayer beta launches this Friday, that’s only for PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 players who have the game pre-ordered. The open beta will begin on October 8, and has been confirmed to arrive on other platforms, but word has been scarce on the timing of that release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III arrives on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC on November 10, 2023.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Call of Duty: NEXT event, as well as the Call of Duty Endowment Bowl IV will both take place on Thursday, October 5 starting at 9:00 a.m. PST/11:00 a.m. EST.

The developer FuturLab revealed a new trailer for the virtual reality spray-fest today. \n\n\nYou'll be able to explore the town of Muckingham like never before with a 360-degree view of the washing action. If you pre-order this experience, you'll get the Cat-Proof gloves as an in-game item.\n\n\n\n\nPower washing in VR sounds like a relaxing task\n\n\nThroughout the town of Muckingham, you'll be able to clean a skate park, play golf with your spray gun, and wash cars in a garage. You can even clean up the mayor's house. How fancy. \n\n\nThe co-op VR experience may be a bit odd, however. The PowerWash Simulator VR release date trailer shows each team member as a floating head with two hands. It might be strange for those who want to see the bodies of each person in your squad. \n\n\nWhat makes VR so entertaining, on the other hand, is the physical interactivity behind your movements in-game.

In fact, if the recent Steam survey is to be believed, it shows team green's products appear to be preferred when it comes to gaming.\n\n\nIf you head over to the Steam hardware survey page, you can see that the Nvidia RTX 3060 has now taken the top spot across all video cards. Not only is it top, but it jumped up from 4.87% to 6.27% since August and has knocked the GTX 1650 down one place.\n\n\nImage via Nvidia Newsroom.\n\n\nIn fact, Nvidia GPUs are pretty much dominating again, according to these results. The first 11 in the \"All Video Cards\" category are from Nvidia, with the first AMD Radeon card appearing 12th. Intel doesn't get a look in until position 15.\n\n\nWhat's the deal?\n\n\nThere could be a number of factors as to why the RTX 3060 is now the preferred graphics card against the still popular (though much older) GTX 1650. A report from PC Gamer says it's likely down to the price of the 3060 dropping significantly, especially in a post-pandemic and a time in which cryptomining doesn't seem to be as fierce.\n\n\nWe're also starting to see some newer (or rather current) generation GPUs cropping up now, though things like the RTX 4090 have fallen slightly. Considering Steam barely registered any current-gen hardware, maybe this is a sign that people are starting to upgrade.\n\n\nOf course, this survey is not necessarily the definitive way to find out what PC users have in their rigs. Of course, it's going to provide a pretty substantial figure, but not everyone will be using Steam. I know.

A further tweet from Masahiro Ito says that this took 20 years to find, and that they'd \"totally forgot [about] the bloody cords.\" There may even be some details that have still not been found.\n\n\nIt kind of really hammers home how much detail goes into each Silent Hill installment. It remains to be seen whether the upcoming releases will put as much care into their worlds as people like Ito did in the classic games. Then again, he is working with Bloober Team on the remake, so we'll see.\n\n\nWith it coming up to Halloween, fans across the globe are going to be keeping their ear to the ground on any developments regarding the triumphant return of Konami's legendary horror series.\n\nThe post Silent Hill 3 art director pleased tiny detail has finally been spotted after 20 years appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the announcement, the team said the closure is primarily due to a lack of resources for its next game.\n\n\n“We’re not writing off the possibility of working on some small stuff together in the future but for now we’re all going our separate ways,” the post said.\n\n\n\n\nIn the replies, one user asked about crowdfunding, to which the account responded that “we’ve discussed it before but it’s never quite made sense for our situation, unfortunately.” \n\n\nAs for the rather crude means of conveying this message, the studio said no one on the team wanted to make “a professional-looking closure announcement with the logo on it and everything.”\n\n\nBoomerang X launched on July 21, 2021 for PC via both Steam and the Epic Game Store, as well as the Nintendo Switch. It currently has an “overwhelmingly positive” review score on Steam.

Get ready for regular doses of the remake, starting with the key to the RPG's cast. The protagonist is in the spotlight first, and you can sample Aleks Le's voice acting in the video below. \n\n\n\n\nPersona 3's protagonist was previously voiced by Akira Ishida (Kaworu in Evangelion) in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal (Peter Parker in Insomniac's Spider-Man games) in English. New VA Aleks Le has pulled in some big roles over the years, including Zenitsu in the Demon Slayer anime and Luke in Street Fighter 6. He leads a full refresh of the English voice cast behind the original.\n\n\nIt's Tartarus time\n\n\nWe still have a few months to go until the launch of Persona 3 Reload, so look for a bunch of these to follow shortly after. Atlus said it will be unveiling new character trailers every week on the Atlus West YouTube channel. Persona 3 is a fan-favorite that could definitely do with a touch-up, so it should be fun to see how everything develops as we get closer to release.\n\n\nWe'll find out how the changes shake out when Persona 3 Reload launches on February 2, 2024. In addition to Game Pass, the remake will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC.

          "description": "Epic Games has been in the news a lot lately, and not for the best of reasons. At the end of last month, the Fortnite developer let go of around 16% of its workforce, which impacted a whopping roughly 830 employees. Around that time, Hato Moa, the developer of the bird-based dating sim Hatoful Boyfriend called the company out via Twitter for failing to pay owed royalties. \n\n\nAccording to Moa, when Epic acquired Mediatonic in 2021, the royalties ceased. But, in a surprisingly hopeful turn of events, Epic has reached out to Moa publicly with confirmation that the company is “looking into” said missing royalties.\n\n\n\n\n“btw I’ve got no royalty payment for Hatoful Boyfriend from Epic since they acquired Mediatonic back in spring 2021. I don’t think the sales have been zero for two years?” said Moa in a thread on Twitter. “The obligations were transferred to Epic, but they’ve never sent any replies to me. Do you have any ideas to make contact with the right person?”\n\n\n\n\nIt took a little less than 18 hours, but Epic Publishing finally responded in a reply to Moa’s thread, saying it was “looking into this” and to expect a direct line of communication to be established. As of writing, that looks to be the end of this story. If any further updates are made on behalf of Moa or Epic Games, we’ll be certain to update this page accordingly. \n\nThe post Epic is ‘looking into’ missing royalties for Hatoful Boyfriend creator appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Retro-Bit has announced that the next in their line of retro reissues is Cybernator under the name that the Gods of Nomenclature intended: Assault Suit Valken.\n\n\nNot only is Assault Suit Valken adopting the name of its original Japanese release, Retro-Bit is also going to the effort of retranslating it and restoring the content that was censored in the Western release. Back in March, Rainmaker Productions partnered with M2 to make a similar re-release happen on Switch as Assault Suit Valken: Declassified. However, this release won’t be using the same script. Also, as stated in the press release, they weren’t able to maintain the protagonist name entry function, so, as Retro-Bit puts it, “everyone gets to be Jake!”\n\n\nImage via Retro-Bit\n\n\nThe new release will come in two flavors: the Deluxe Edition, which comes with an embossed slipcase and some extra swag for $79.99, and the Collector’s Cartridge, which just includes the game, a hardcover box, and an instruction manual for $59.99. Both will be limited production runs based on the number of preorders they rack up. Retro-Bit recently sent me a care box of some of their releases, and I can tell you that their reissues are pretty deluxe.\n\n\nI’ve written about Assault Suit Valken more times and in more depth than I thought I ever would. It is a pretty excellent title, and one of the absolute best side-scrolling mech games to ever have been produced. Its North American release as Cybernator cut back a few features, such as character profiles, and censored the ending. These weren’t drastic changes by the standards at the time, but a lot of fans swear by the original version.\n\n\nPre-orders for the Assault Suit Valken reissue will be open from October 3rd to November 5th, 2023 on Castlemania Games and Limited Run Games. The finished produce is expected to ship Q1 of 2024.\n\nThe post Retro-Bit is reissuing Cybernator on SNES as Assault Suit Valken appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sources have told Kotaku that developer Naughty Dog has laid off at least 25 contractor positions. Naughty Dog is responsible for Uncharted and The Last of Us series.\n\n\nAccording to Kotaku, the layoffs have only been sent internally and were sent off last week. The employees were notified that their contracts are set to terminate at the end of October, but no severance has been offered. It’s estimated that about 25 roles are being terminated, most of which are in the quality assurance department. However, it’s reported that some in the art and production department are also affected.\n\n\nFurthermore, sources say that the multiplayer spin-off for The Last of Us is currently seeing some troubles. Bloomberg had previously reported that Sony was diverting money away from the project, but now it’s being reported that the spin-off is currently “on ice.” Not outright canceled, but on the back burner.\n\n\n25 might seem like a small number against the studio’s estimated 400 employees (roughly 6% of their headcount), but this is part of a growing wave of layoffs across the industry. Personally, I’m having trouble keeping track. Recently, Epic Games terminated around 830 jobs, Embracer has been cutting positions with some regularity, Team17 reportedly plans to drop a significant number of roles. Bioware, Firaxis, and on and on.

WB has announced that the Batman: Arkham Trilogy pack has been shifted out of its original October 13 window (which was right around the corner!) and is now set for December.\n\n\nHere's the full statement from the game's official Twitter account:\n\n\n\n\"Batman: Arkham Trilogy for Nintendo Switch will now launch on December 1, 2023. More time is needed to bring players the best possible experience on Nintendo Switch. We apologize to fans who are excited to play this version of the trilogy. Thank you for your patience.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, this trilogy includes Batman: Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, forgoing the prequel story of Arkham Origins. Sadly, only one game is actually on the cart (Arkham Asylum), and the rest will be digital downloads. Yep, you'll need an online connection to actually get the other two games if you buy the pack physically.\n\n\nNormally platform proliferation and more physical releases are a great thing, but as usual, WB is going about it in a really strange and potentially buggy way. We'll have to wait a few more months to see the state of the Arkham trilogy on Switch. Hopefully, at the very least, Arkham Asylum (the crown jewel and the only game on the cart) is stable!\n\nThe post Predictably, Batman: Arkham Trilogy is delayed on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Set to release on October 6, it will continue the mystery-solving adventures of the gruff-voiced yellow rodent. \n\n\n\n\nIn the lead-up to Detective Pikachu Returns, Nintendo has released a story trailer recapping the events of the first. This is great for newcomers who want to jump in without playing the first game. It's also useful for return players, as Detective Pikachu was released in 2018, so you may need to brush up on your knowledge.  \n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nDetective Pikachu's story so far \n\n\nAs the trailer reminds us, the franchise features a Pikachu who fancies himself a great detective. In the first game, he crosses paths with a boy named Tim Goodman. Together, they search for Detective Harry, who happens to be Tim's dad.\n\n\nWhile hunting for Harry, they uncover crimes being committed by Pokemon influenced by a strange chemical called R. Pikachu and Tim manage to get to the bottom of things, though they never do locate Harry. They haven't stopped searching, and it appears the hunt continues in Detective Pikachu Returns. \n\n\nThe upcoming game has the opportunity to try plenty of new things now that the franchise has leapt from the 3DS to the Switch.

          "description": "After the Wii’s release, we went through a period of denial. We were promised that it was motion controls – not the next generation of graphical splendor – that would carry video games into the future. But while Wii Sports was fun, we wanted to see what motion controls could do outside a set of family-friendly minigame compilations. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess didn’t make very good use of the controls, but it was really a port of a GameCube title. So, we just needed to wait a bit longer, and the vision Nintendo promised us would eventually arrive.\n\n\nSometime before, we just gave up and realized that motion controls just kind of suck in general, Escape from Bug Island hit the shelves.

          "description": "Sergiy Galyonkin has announced via Twitter today that he has resigned from his role as Director of Publishing Strategy at Epic Games. He had been with the company for over eight years.\n\n\nIn his post, Sergiy Galyonkin thanks Epic for the aid they’ve donated in support of Ukraine during Russia’s ongoing invasion. He outlines his role in establishing Epic’s direction (which he refers to as Epic 4.0), but opines that he doesn’t feel he is a fit for their new course (Epic 5.0).\n\n\n“Now, Epic Games is on its way to transforming from a game developer, engine creator, and publisher into a platform - Epic 5.0. I am not a good fit for this new version of Epic; it requires people of a different kind.”\n\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Sergey Galyonkin was the creator of the Steam Spy service in 2015, which tracks sales through the Steam platform. He then used his experience with tracking the platform to help Epic create the Epic Games Store.\n\n\nI’m not going to speculate on the deeper meaning of Galyonkin’s departure, as I don’t want to put words in his mouth. I do have to wonder about the timing of this, as just last week Epic Games cut 16% of its workforce as a way of refocusing. It just feels bad, and I would be shocked if the two things weren’t related.\n\n\nAt the very least, Galyonkin goes on to say, “I plan to remain in the gaming industry. I also hope to be more vocal now that I don’t have to worry about the PR department knocking on my DMs.” Considering the valuable insight he shared before joining Epic, I’m personally looking forward to seeing what he dishes out now.\n\nThe post Epic’s Director of Publishing Strategy, Sergiy Galyonkin, is leaving the company appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Aside from some legendary monsters and surprisingly strong event battles, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet loves pitting players against starter Pokemon from previous generations in Tera Raid battles. And this weekend, it seems like we'll return to that standard with a slight twist. As the next 7-Star Tera Raid event, all Pokemon Scarlet & Violet trainers will face off against Hisuian Decidueye.\n\n\nAccording to the official Pokemon account on Twitter, the Hisuian Decidueye Tera Raid will utilize the Grass Tera Type. By default it's a Grass/Fighting-Type hybrid, though its movepool has a lot of potential coverage. So while several Pokemon fare well against Grass-Types, you may need to wait until we know its attacks to form an optimal counter. Like past 7-Star raids, this one will feature the Mightiest Mark that gives it the \"Unrivaled\" title if you catch it, which is a nice perk for hardcore collectors.\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen Decidueye in a Tera Raid. In fact, the last time we saw this ‘mon in Scarlet & Violet was last March. However, this one is specifically the Hisuian variant from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. \n\n\nThis raid will be available in two date ranges: October 5 at 9:00 a.m. JST / 8:00 p.m. EST to October 9 at 8:59 a.m. JST / 7:59 p.m. EST, and then again on October 12 at 9:00 a.m. JST / 8:00 p.m. EST to October 15 at 8:59 a.m. JST / 7:59 p.m. EST. Whether you challenge Hisuian Decidueye this weekend or next weekend, best of luck!\n\nThe post The next Pokemon Scarlet & Violet 7-Star Tera Raid event features Hisuian Decidueye appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if you think I’m not going to stab it at least once, then clearly we have different gaming priorities. What ensued was a dramatic tussle of climbing on the monster, taking shots when I could, all while my army of Pawns fought by my side and shouted canned, unnecessary phrases.\n\n\nAfter depleting one of its four health bars, the griffin flew high into the sky, putting an abrupt end to our battle.

What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players \"will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.\" \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the \"Little Man\" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.\nThe Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween. \nAre you interested in checking out The Forest Cathedral? Let us know in the comments below!",

Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. \nThe trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. \nIn the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it.

Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.\nIn addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.\nFor more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.\n[Source: Eurogamer, VG247]\nWhat do you think about this year's massive amount of layoffs?",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision.\" \nSega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that \"there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time.\" \nSega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022.

Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. \nThere's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. \nCheck out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
