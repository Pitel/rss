Publisher Crunching Koalas and developer Dexai Arts have today released the first-person bouncer simulator Techno Banter on the Switch eShop and it looks... strange.\nThis is a game all about deciding which party guests get into a club and which are told to take a hike. It's a similar concept to what we've seen in the likes of Papers, Please and Lil' Guardsman, but Techno Banter mixes things up with, you guessed it, banter. You'll have to use your wit to hit any unruly potential guests with clever comebacks, keeping the party vibing and keeping the line in check.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Put Cupid on hold, because Date Everything is now expected to launch in June.\nIn a statement from Sassy Chap Games' Lead Designer Ray Chase, the dev explained that while the game is complete, there's still a whole bunch of testing that needs to be done.

Combining a heavy atmosphere with tough, Soulslike combat in a dark fantasy world, it stood out as a notably quality addition to a genre that feels like it gets at least one new entry every week. The sequel, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the mist, is a strong iteration on its predecessor's formula. It's everything a Metroidvania should be and, even if it’s not exactly revolutionary, it executes its vision well.\nEnder Magnolia is set a number of years after Ender Lilies, placing you in the role of Lilac, a young girl who awakens from a long slumber in a strange and decaying world. What’s left of society is occupied by two different races: humans and the creepy machines called Homunculi. Some Homunculi could easily pass as human while others have much more monstrous or animalistic traits, and all are susceptible to corruption from a mysterious mist called fumes. Luckily, Lilac happens to be an Attuner—someone who can directly purify corrupted Homunculi—so you set out on a journey to uncover her lost memories and do what you can to set the world straight.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become \"a more agile, focused studio\", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.\r\n\n\r\nAll of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're \"taking the opportunity to reimagine\" how BioWare operate between projects, and \"have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.\" Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.\nRead more",

The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.\nIt isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.\nRead more",

When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.\nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game \"will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story...\" Witchy hackers? I'm in.\nRead more",

I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.\nMy Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end.

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them?

Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own \"hangout game\". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine. \nRead more",

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control.

My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them?

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.\n  \nRead more",

Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.\nIts technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.\nRead more",

The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. \nRead more",

There were two options: the basic game and the Deluxe version, which promised extra items and outfits with “no need to wait.”\n\n\nSome people purchased the basic game with a view to upgrade to the Deluxe version later if they liked the experience, because it was labeled as a DLC.

          "description": "The makers of Forza have just announced via their official blog that Microsoft will be releasing yet another of the Xbox big hitters on the PS5. This time it's Forza Horizon 5, one of the best \"chillout\" racing games of all time.\n\n\nThe port of Forza Horizon 5 is being developed not just by Turn 10 Studios, the people responsible for all the games in the series so far, but by Panic Button in partnership with Playground games and Turn 10. \n\n\n\n\nIf you're just hearing about Panic Button for the first time, rest assured, as they're behind fantastic Switch ports of Id titles such as Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal.\n\n\nMicrosoft stated that all content from the Xbox version of the game will be present in the game. That includes all existing car packs available in the store, and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions. \n\n\nAnd that's not all, as the Forza team is working on a new free content update for all platforms, which will be called Horizon Realms. The new update will allow players to explore a collection of some of the community's favorite Evolving Words, and also a few surprises. The best addition, however, will likely be the chance to cross-play with everyone on Xbox, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n\n\n\"We are excited to see the Forza Horizon 5 community grow with new players on PS5, and we can't wait to see the creativity and skill these new creators, builders, and racers will bring to our vibrant community.\"\n\n\nPhil Spencer seemingly was not bluffing when he said the exclusivity model doesn't work for the Xbox, so we're pretty excited to see what other once tightly-guarded Xbox exclusives will be entering the multi-platform zone.\n\n\nYou can wishlist Forza Horizon 5 right now on the PlayStation Store, and wait for it to release sometime during Spring.\n\nThe post Another blow to Xbox exclusivity as Forza Horizon 5 is coming to the PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "This time last year, the finale of Bombservice's Momodora series of indie Metroidvanias had just hit PC, and as revealed during today's PLAYISM Game Show Mini, Moonlit Farewell is making the leap to consoles on February 6, 2025.\n\n\nWhile there's no shortage of options for Metroidvanias, there's something truly special about the Momodora series. You'll soon be able to explore this excellent swan song on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. Here's a Switch trailer from the announcement for another look at what Moonlit Farewell has to offer.\n\n\n\n\nFor my money, Momodora: Moonlit Farewell ticks all the right boxes. It's not too long but still clocks in with a beefier adventure than its predecessors. The visuals are outstanding, the bosses are all fun to fight, and the new Sigil system offers up a mix of interesting buffs and tempting risk-reward debuffs. \n\n\nAs for new stuff, it sounds like the console version will just include content from the major updates, like the Boss Rush mode. The press release also mentions a newly added post-credits boss battle, which was also part of the PC version's March 2024 update. \n\n\nIt's been 15 years since Guilherme \"rdein\" Martins first kicked the series off with the original Momodora. If you include the spiritual sequel. Minoria. there are six games in total, each worth the little time they ask of players. It'll be nice to have more options soon to traverse the final entry's expertly-woven map.\n\nThe post The excellent Momodora: Moonlit Farewell makes console debut on February 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pokemon TCG Pocket has recurring events to make things more interesting, from Mass Outbreaks that increase the odds of finding certain Pokemon card types to Space-Time Smackdown, among others. However, whenever event-exclusive packs come out, Genetic Apex mysteriously disappears. Don't worry, though; you can still open them right now.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAre Genetic Apex packs gone in Pokemon TCG Pocket?\n\n\nDuring Pokemon TCG Pocket events like Space-Time Smackdown, Genetic Apex packs are pushed away from the home screen and instead appear in a separate menu. On your booster pack screen, tap \"Select other booster packs\" to see every available option, including any current event-exclusive packs, Genetic Apex, and more.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe most likely reason Genetic Apex packs disappear from the home screen is that Pokemon TCG Pocket can advertise ongoing event packs with higher odds of special cards. For example, Space-Time Smackdown features rare cards like Dialga ex, Palkia ex, and Lucario that you can't currently get anywhere else, allowing you to expand your deck beyond usual means.\n\n\nYou can change your booster pack without penalty if you want to return to a more familiar pack. Similarly, if you recently swapped to Genetic Apex but want to try some event packs, you can return to the booster pack list and check them out.\n\n\nBeyond this, the process is the same. Once you pick Genetic Apex as your current booster pack, you'll find your usual Pikachu, Charizard, and Mewtwo as options. However, closing your Pokemon TCG Pocket app and returning later will show you the event's booster pack screen again, so you'll need to set it back to Genetic Apex each time. If the event ends before you return, you won't have to worry about this until another one starts.\n\nThe post Is Genetic Apex gone in Pokemon TCG Pocket? appeared first on Destructoid.",

To play with the item, you'll have to complete the challenge before it expires from Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at the easiest way to solve the challenge, and if the SBC is worth completing at all.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC tasks\n\n\nThe Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC has only one task, and here are its conditions.\n\n\nTask - Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players from: Brazil\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Team of the Week\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 85\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's a set of solutions you can use to unlock Marta's special card in Ultimate Team. It's a really simple challenge, and you should be having the required fodder in your club. \n\n\nTask - Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC\n\n\n\nAny 9 85-rated items\n\n\nAny 85-rated TOTW item\n\n\nCasemiro 84\n\n\n\nFor 50,000 coins worth of fodder, you'll be able to get a TOTY Honorable Mentions item, so the pricing is on point. However, the item could have been a lot better than what it is. The card can play in four different positions, but the stats are pretty mediocre. She also has only a single playstyle+, which reduces her potential in competitive modes.\n\n\nA SBC with a higher completion cost offering a better card will have been far better than what we have received, and that's my biggest issue with this current Honorable Mentions challenge. If you're a beginner, completing the SBC will be well worth your time. Sadly, most players are likely going to have better cards in their squads at this point in time.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Marta TOTY Honorable Mentions SBC solutions appeared first on Destructoid.",

Specifically, Nvidia is now pushing out official support for its Transformer-based DLSS4 upscaler, which comes with a massive suite of visual and performance improvements by default.\n\n\nThere are two main reasons you'd want to update to driver 572.16, and they're both vast boons from a utility point of view. Firstly, you're getting ready access to Transformer-based upscaling via DLSS4, which provides a huge uplift in the supported games' visual quality. The second reason is related to DLSS4, though it is a tad more technical: you get to update old games' crummy DLSS versions to the latest build.

          "description": "You’re getting stood up, as Sassy Chap Games has announced that they won’t be making the Valentine’s Day launch date for Date Everything as they had planned. Instead, Date Everything will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on June 25.\n\n\nThis is actually the second time the game has been delayed, as it was originally supposed to arrive on October 24, 2024 before getting moved to February 14, 2025. The Valentine’s Day launch would be very appropriate, but according to the release from Designer Ray Chase, “I was too confident that we could properly test ALL the wild amount of content that exists in this massive game, and unfortunately, we ran out of time on our current release date.” Fair enough.\n\n\n\n\nDate Everything is, of course, the dating sim that allows you to date everything. You wander a house and interact with anthropomorphized versions of, well, everything. From the couch to the icebox. More importantly, you can romance them, because no one understands your problems quite like your bed. I have to wonder if the genre pioneers who worked on games like Tokimeki Memorial thought that this is where things would end up.\n\n\nThe delay is unfortunate, but you don’t want bugs getting involved in your passions. Visual novels can get pretty messy, especially when they branch as much as Date Everything promises to. Even with a lot of planning, every variable you add to the mix has the chance of throwing a wrench into the mix. So, I guess what I’m saying is: I’m sorry your date stood you up, chum. I'm sorry everything stood you up.\n\n\nDate Everything is now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on June 25.\n\nThe post It’s going to be a lonely Valentine’s Day as Date Everything gets pushed back to June appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "More good news in the world of tardy translations, Ratalaika Games and Shinyuden are localizing Technos Japan’s 1991 dice-centric Famicom RPG, Sugoro Quest: Dice Heroes. It’s coming February 7 to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\nIt’s interesting news coming in the wake of Super Technos World: River City & Arcade Classics, as it will feature the Super Famicom’s Sugoro Quest++: DICENICS, but won’t be providing a translation. I’m not sure if this news makes that more disappointing or less. At least now we’re getting some Sugoro Quest and not none.\n\n\nSugoro Quest is something of a cross between a board game and a JRPG. The game world is a series of segmented paths that you roll to traverse. Fights also have you pit your dice against those thrown by enemies. Whoever gets the highest number gets to attack. Somewhat like an actual tabletop RPG. Sort of. Some of them. Maybe.\n\n\nWas it any good? I’m not sure, personally. I’ve heard good things and have wanted to try it myself, if only because I’m a fan of Technos’ Famicom output. I was a bit bummed that Sugoro Quest++ isn’t being translated in the Super Technos World collection, but I also understand that translating old games isn’t as easy as it sounds, which is why you should appreciate each and every fan effort.\n\n\nAt the same time, new official translations are becoming more common, and it’s great to see. Not only are we getting games like the Shockman series from Ratalaika and Sinyuden, but there are official cartridge releases from folks like Retro-Bit, collections from Arc Systems Works (Sugoro Quest++ aside), and even Nintendo got in on it with their limited-time re-release of the first Fire Emblem game. Great stuff.\n\n\nSugoro Quest: Dice Heroes is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on February 7, 2025 (thanks to Gematsu for spotting it).\n\nThe post Technos Japan’s Famicom RPG, Sugoro Quest, is finally getting official translation next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

It seems as though developers who worked on Dragon Age: The Vailguard are being moved over to the new project.\n\n\n\n\nThis information follows an announcement from August 2023 that said the company would be \"changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards.\"\n\n\nCarefully chosen language\n\n\nMcCay goes on to say that BioWare is \"taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine\" how the team works. As such, the upcoming Mass Effect game doesn't require support from \"the full studio.\"\n\n\nDo note that at no point does the blog post say that BioWare is actually initiating layoffs or terminating roles at the company. However, the language employed does seem to skirt around this. In fact, a report from IGN, some people at the company have been relocated to other roles.\n\n\nThis also seems to include those who worked on the recent Dragon Age game. The report claims that \"team members are also seeing their roles terminated\" while also being offered new jobs internally. Given this, it does sound like BioWare is indeed restructuring in a way that will affect those who are already working at the studio.\n\n\nAs for the new Mass Effect, we don't have much information to go off at this stage. At the time it was announced a few years ago, it was in the early stages of development, but McCay's post suggests the project is about to become the focus of BioWare.\n\nThe post Mass Effect 5 won’t have ‘support from the full studio,’ as BioWare restructures appeared first on Destructoid.",

But even before its anime success, the manga already built a loyal fanbase. And now, after nine years of serialization, the manga officially comes to an end.\n\n\nKomi Can't Communicate, penned by Tomohito Oda, debuted on Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine in May 2016. The manga ended with Chapter 499, which is available in English on VIZ Media.

Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti.

          "description": "Kvalitní herecké výkony a režie, ale v ostatních ohledech (např. scénář, kamera...) nic zajímavého. Hlavní hrdinka se trápí, trápí, a trápí... až je konec. Trápení je v průběhu filmu trochu permutováno, ale jde pouze o střípky, které (záměrně?) nevytvářejí žádný dramatický celek, natož zápletku. (Ilča 50 %)",

          "description": "Z dosavadních Eggersových filmů je tento nejméně autorský, nejméně konzistentní a nejvíce působí jako kdyby do jeho vzniku někdo kecal ohledně jeho komerčního potenciálu. Výsledek je tudíž poněkud schizofrenní, chvíli artový, chvíli komerční, a nepříjemně rozvleklý. (Ilča 70 %)",
