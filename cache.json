          "description": "'Rhythm-Violence' game is now 5 years old.\nWhen the Nintendo Switch launched in March 2017, I — like many others — devoured The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I was hooked, and it was only when Mario Kart 8 Deluxe launched a month later that I was wrenched away from the land of Hyrule. But while Mario Kart 8 remains as incredible as it was on the Wii U — more so, in fact — I bounced off it pretty quickly; a case of ‘been there, done that’, perhaps. I’d already completed the non-Deluxe version and felt like I was just going through the motions. Nevertheless, I played it more or less to completion; after all, I dropped £50 on the digital version, giving me a certain obligation to at least polish off the single-player component.\nSo with that done, I found myself in a bit of a rut; I’d rinsed Breath of the Wild and I now faced a daunting two or three months without anything to keep me occupied until the eventual release of Splatoon 2. Then a game popped up on the eShop in May 2017; a smaller, unassuming title that nevertheless gained much-deserved recognition and acclaim in the months leading up to its release. That game was Thumper.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In truth it doesn't hold up as well as its outstanding sequel, but it's an iconic game among retro enthusiasts and some of us that had our young minds blown back in the day.\nAlways open to monetising nostalgia, SEGA has teamed up with Numskull Designs for a few bits of merchandise, available now in Europe from the official online SEGA store. As you can see in the image at the top there's a t-shirt, hat and mug - presumably because some consumers that happen to be older gentlemen like this scribe need t-shirts for getting the groceries, a hat to cover the expanding bald spot, and a mug for drinking tea and coffee.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Pleasingly this includes the Insect Glaive, which in this writer's humble opinion is the most awesome of Monster Hunter weapons, though it certainly got debuffed a bit in Rise.

If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. \nThere’s already a starship's load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like \"Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,\" and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we've heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

I can't think of many other games which have you photographing scenes of daily life and struggle amidst a Neon Genesis Evangelion-grade cataclysmic kaiju event.

          "description": "“In a way you could say that we’ve been failing at teaching Eve for 19 years,” says Bergur Finnbogason, the creative director of Eve Online. It’s not the whole story when it comes to new players in the infamous space MMO, but it is the dominant one. \nAmong the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.\nRead more",

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.\nRead more",

          "description": "AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. \r\n\n\r\nThe lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake's audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game's art, they've announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”\r\n\n\r\nBut I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.\nThe times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the \"It's me, Blorko!\" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it.

The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.\r\n\n\r\nThe game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time.

She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's \"weird and creepy\", and has recently been looking for something new to play. \"I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,\" she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. \nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share.

          "description": "A gorgeous, Ghibli-style sim\nI'm always chasing the high of my first playthrough of Stardew Valley. It's among my favorite games of all time, and something comforting I reach for during tough times, so having other titles to add to that arsenal is always a plus. We could always use more Stardew-likes. That's not a saying yet, but it needs to be. It would make looking for new games a whole lot easier. For now, though, I have seen one new game on the horizon that will satisfy my need for a cozy life sim: Spirittea.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi4GmC4v6sI\nThe logline for Spirittea is Stardew Valley meets Spirited Away, which alone is enough to make me buy this game.\nIn this upcoming PC game, you'll play as a character who arrives in a beautiful rural town, where you meet NPCs to befriend and can partake in lots of hobbies like bug catching or karaoke — but then, of course, you accidentally drink from a cup of tea that allows you to see the spirit world! With the help of a friendly cat, you're also tasked with helping to run the local bathhouse, helping soothe its ghostly patrons rather than them haunting others. Good thing I have some time to prepare before Spirittea comes out, because if I had access to this game right now, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't see the sun for a good while there.\nSpirittea is coming to us from developer Cheesemaster Games, and is published by No More Robots, who are best known for publishing titles like Hypno Space Outlaw and Descenders. Like ConcernedApe (aka Eric Barone), the beloved developer behind Stardew Valley, Cheesemaster is actually just one guy, Dan Beckerton. Like Barone, Beckerton is extremely passionate about his project, and has spent a great deal of time working on it.\nI personally can't wait to check out all of the amazing work that he's put in, so I'll be looking forward to Spirittea's release, whenever that will be.\nThe post Spirittea is a delicious mix of Stardew Valley and Spirited Away appeared first on Destructoid.",

Already available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, the \"Academy Juvenile RPG\" will be available to purchase via Steam and the Epic Games Store from June 23.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFT5p6LdcwA\nFor those less inclined, The Caligula Effect 2 is the follow-up to the 2016 PS Vita original, and details the exploits of a party of fresh-faced teens known as \"The Go-Home Club.\" These kids are trapped within the unnervingly idyllic walls of \"Redo\" an alternate universe where all of your regrets are undone, your mistakes rectified, and your high school years played out in perpetuity, sans any end-of-day bell.\nExplore the \"perfect world\" of Redo, befriend your fellow denizens, learn of their true selves and pasts, and you'll soon begin to understand why it's the flaws, mistakes, and errors of judgment that, ultimately, make us who we truly are.\nOn PlayStation and Switch, The Caligula Effect 2 launched to mixed reviews, (airing mostly on the positive side). While many critics and players enjoyed the sequel's premise, combat, world, and cast of characters, some found that the sequel fell into the typical JRPG pitfalls of featuring too much narrative padding and an emphasis on The Grind in regards to its dungeon crawling.\nThe Caligula Effect 2 launches June 23 on PC (via Steam and EGS).

Japanese outfit Inti Creates has revealed some new tidbits regarding the action-packed sequel, ahead of its anticipated launch on July 28.\nFirst and foremost, it is to be noted that this second mainline sequel will see the Azure Striker Gunvolt series receive a fully scripted English voiceover for the first time in series history. Popular voice actors Sean Chiplock, Kelly Baskin, and Ryan Colt Levy will step into the metallic shoes of Gunvolt, Kirin, and Black Badge respectively, while singer Diana Garnet will portray overseer Lumen, aka \"The Muse.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heDpzWIqo54\nInti Creates also offered a first look at the sequel's unique \"Story Mode+\" option, which will see the entire gameplay out in real-time, seamlessly posting plot details and dialogue directly into the action, without the need for pausing, cutscenes, or any other interruptions. This mode will surely be popular among budding speedrunners, while delivering a non-stop take on the sci-fi action for all other players.\nFinally, Limited Run Games revealed that it has opened pre-orders on physical editions of Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 for Nintendo Switch. PhysEd fans can bag themselves a standard boxed copy of the title for $39.99 USD, or splash out on the Collector's Edition, which includes an official art book, double CD soundtrack, and a cute \"Dogvolt\" keychain for $79.99. Both editions are available to pre-order now from the Limited Run Games store.\nOh, and speaking of soundtracks, be sure to check out the music video below, featuring the Japanese voice of Lumen, Megu Sakuragawa, performing one of the sequel's many compositions \"Traces.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSeSZYcVo8E&t\nThe post Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 will debut an English voice cast appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The first premium membership skin is underwhelming at best\nThe Pokemon Unite membership program is now live, and sadly, it wasn't really tweaked from its original leaked incarnation.\nNow live worldwide, the Pokemon Unite membership program (called the \"Unite Club\") costs $9.99 per month, which is a rather large disconnect compared to what other subscriptions offer. Here's what you get:\nA \"first time membership benefit\" of a trainer outfit\n40 gems a day (more on that later)\nOne premium skin a month (more on that in a moment)\nAdditional unite licenses each week (read: a few more \"free rotation\" characters, which is useless if you own them all)\nTrial Holowear (skins) each week\nSpecial portrait frames and speech bubbles\n10% off new fashion items\nDon't all cheer at once!\nNaturally, these sorts of programs (like a similar one for Fortnite) come with a marquee monthly skin. And really, this is one of the most front-facing disappointing aspects of the Pokemon Unite membership. Like many Unite skins, this Greedent Holowear outfit can barely be considered a tweak from the original model.\nAlso, note this proviso: \"you will receive 40 Aeos gems daily as a login bonus.\" Digging into the FAQ, it's important to note that even the membership program is a method of getting you to log in every day: \"If you log in and forget to claim the bonus or if the bonus resets without you logging in, you will not be able to receive Aeos gems for the missed day.\" The Fortnite membership service by comparison provides the equivalent of $10 worth of V-Bucks no questions asked, on a monthly basis (that isn't drip-fed).\nOne more caveat to keep in mind: \"Club membership benefits can only be received on the platform used to join.\"\nYou can find a full FAQ on the membership here, if you are planning on getting it.\nThe post Pokemon Unite launches its low value $10-per-month membership appeared first on Destructoid.",

Interested psychopaths can dive into the weird and violent world of futuristic game show Death Jamboree, battling it out with a variety of post-apocalyptic contestants, all under the watchful and highly excitable eyes of hosts Queen B and Bryan Zemeckis. Check out Deathverse's wild world in the gameplay trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx58XTnmjOs\nSet in 2026, as the planet rises from the aftermath of global conflict, Deathverse: Let it Die sees a populace seeking to quench its bloodlust through Death Jamboree's consistent delivery of extreme violence. The show's contestants — each sporting unique looks, skills, and abilities — utilize sci-fi weaponry, ethereal powers, and sometimes just good, old-fashioned right hooks in order to mash the opposition and take their place among the pantheon of Death Jamboree champions.\nIf you fancy your chances against a roster of retro-future warriors in the kill-or-be-killed world of Death Jamboree, then all you need do is pre-load the Deathverse: Let it Die module on either PS4 or PS5 ahead of the server's launch, and you'll be good to go. The chaos kicks off on May 28 at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST until 19:00 PT / 22:00 ET / 03:00 BST. Of course, as the beta is designed specifically to stress test the servers, it may be host to various bugs and outages. A further test will be held on June 5.\nDeathverse: Let it Die is scheduled to launch on PlayStation later in 2022.\nThe post Manic survival title Deathverse: Let it Die gets an open beta next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The competitive team sports game will go live next week on May 25 as a free-to-play title.\nThe action kicks off on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, as well as Xbox Series X|S and PS5 via backward compatibility. Roller Champions will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna, though it'll be at a later date.\nThe roller derby action sports game Roller Champions was first announced by Ubisoft a few years ago. Ever since, it's been rolling through a few technical tests and delays, popping up every now and then before disappearing into the night. Now, at least, the high-octane roller bash is finally debuting.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUAWz0jH1A4\nThe general flow of Roller Champions is two teams of roller skaters competing to reach five points. They pick up these points by racing laps around the arena with the ball in their possession, cashing them in when they dunk it in the goal. There's wallriding, tackling, and general action-sports moves to cause chaos along the way.\n\nPush it to the brink\nIt looks like Roller Champions will also have the features of most modern F2P games. Play online matches in quick play alone or with pals. There are maps to unlock and time-limited modes, as well as cosmetics to customize your avatar's appearance. And of course, seasons with special cosmetics linked to them. The kickoff season starts the day Roller Champions launches.\nThe nice part is that Roller Champions isn't just free-to-play, but also cross-play and cross-progression, so it's easy enough to hop and check it out on any platform. There's also some social hangout areas, with practice rinks and minigames. It's a bit of a sudden surprise, but Ubisoft's Roller Champions looks to finally put some wheels down in the arena next week.\nThe post Ubisoft’s Roller Champions rolls out next week on May 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game's director Yoji Fujito notes that people shouldn't be worried about that happening \"anytime soon,\" and that \"higher-ups\" are informing Fujito and his team to \"continue on\" with the game.\nIt's good news for fans to get short-term confirmation, but it also seems like the game isn't even on the chopping block at this time. So just how long will it go on? Well, only Square Enix management can say. But even if it ended next week, 20 years is quite the run!\nAt the moment, the two MMOs seem like an important part of Square Enix's portfolio. While Final Fantasy XIV is obviously more successful, the publisher sees value in their internal IP, and generally treats the Final Fantasy series with reverence (barring some port job quality control), and plays the long game.

(Translation via VGC and @aitaikimochi on Twitter.)\nThe comment doesn't seem to have any more specifics, in terms of what this means related to Final Fantasy VII. Hopes would be high that this signals some news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, but there could also be other projects in the works.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge73iBqc7o8\nChange your fate\nThe first installment of Final Fantasy VII Remake landed in 2020, after a long wait for its eventual drop. And the interstitial update Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade landed a year later, adding some extra Yuffie content to the fold.\nWherever Part 2 of Final Fantasy VII Remake is, chances are good it's still in the works. Some confirmation of what's coming though, and especially how the team plans to tackle the story after Cloud and the gang leave Midgar, would be interesting to see.\nIt sounds like a decent chunk of Final Fantasy XVI news is on the way. Producer Naoki Yoshida recently said a new trailer is on the way for the next big numbered installment in Final Fantasy.\nWith Summer Game Fest just around the corner, chances of some Final Fantasy news showing up seem high.

This is a game where I once had to create a giant checklist to keep track of all of the demos, cross-media projects, DLC, and crossovers. Well, as of this week Square Enix reports that Final Fantasy XV sales have hit a new milestone of 10 million units worldwide.\nSquare Enix \"thanks fans for their continued support\" for the game. And continued support it has gotten, from a certain point of view! Even as recently as the past few years, there's been crossovers with other games, including a recurring Final Fantasy XIV event. In a sense, this game refused to die, and earned that 10 million through sheer force of will. I'm not just talking about the cross-media projects either. Two years after launch it came to PC, where it was met with a flourishing modding community. Then it arrived on Stadia a year later.\nFinal Fantasy XV is polarizing still, I get it. It has what I can only describe as \"Final Fantasy VIII energy,\" which was also polarizing at the time, and a mixed legacy that endures to this day. Playing through it in a bubble before all the controversy, DLC, and post-launch content delays, I found it to be exceedingly relaxing, among other things. In the eternal \"Final Fantasy rankings\" debate that's been going on since I can remember (Final Fantasy VI kind of sealed that top spot at release though, and for some, even still): it'll probably end up somewhere in the middle.\nThe post Final Fantasy XV hits 10 million in worldwide sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the clip, we see Berserker going, umm, berserk, the spritely Striker dodging trouble in the woods, and the noble Dragon Knight having a bit of a lie-down. The scenes have full voice acting and sport some very nice, comic-book style artwork. In addition, the new trailer also includes a look at a gallery mode, as well as an in-game glossary — no doubt to help newcomers get up to speed in the world of Dungeon Fighter Online.\nDNF Duel, first revealed back in the winter of 2020, has spent the past year turning heads with its dramatic and action-packed trailers, rad character designs, and promises of enthralling battles powered by silky-smooth rollback connections. Recent betas, (poorly timed to coincide with other popular betas and game releases), did not exactly set the FGC alight, but many players found enjoyment in DNF Duel's specific brand of fantasy carnage.

          "description": "Home updates to version 2.0 soon\n[Update: Pokemon Home Legends support (and BDSP) is just around the corner, as the official Pokemon account has informed users of a Home maintenance period later today at 5:00PM PT. It's expected that sometime in the early morning of May 18, US time, the 2.0 update will be completed.]\n[Update #2: It's complete! You can now update to Home 2.0.]\nPokemon Home Legends support is on the way, along with the addition of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP), a new blog has announced.\nThe Pokemon Company is calling this \"Home 2.0,\" and in short, all roads will lead to Home now; including the prior supported Pokemon Sword/Shield, Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu, Pokemon Go, and the Pokemon Bank, on top of the aforementioned new additions.\nHere's a quick rundown of how boxes will be filed:\n\"Until now, the only Pokedex in Pokemon Home was the National Pokedex. But starting from version 2.0.0, the Pokedex from each game will be added.​ Pokemon in your Boxes in Pokemon Home will be registered in their respective game's Pokedex after version 2.0.0 of Pokemon Home is installed.​ Pokemon that aren't in a Box when the ver. 2.0.0 update is installed, such as those that have been traded away, will not be registered.\"\n\nInterestingly, when Pokemon are transferred to or from Pokemon Legends, they will be found in \"strange balls\" due to the lore differences and time jump considerations. Those are pretty much the only provisos you need to be aware of.\nAnd here's the list of promo items you'll get:\nBy depositing a BDSP Pokemon into Home Switch: Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup with Hidden Abilities as Mystery Gifts in Home mobile\nBy depositing a Pokemon from Legends into Home Switch: Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawott with maximum effort levels as Mystery Gifts in Home mobile\nA final date has not been announced, but many expect it to arrive this month, which would be inline with similar announcement timelines.\nThe post Pokemon Home support for Legends and BDSP is here (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "They'll (literally) tear your heart out\nToday, Behaviour Interactive hosted a sixth anniversary stream for its asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight. And amidst the doom and gloom, there was one surprising reveal: a Dead by Daylight dating sim called Hooked on You. Yes, a dating sim for dating the Killers of Dead by Daylight.\nIt might seem unreal but it is, somehow, a real actual dating sim arriving this summer. Last year, Behaviour Interactive asked players in a survey what kind of spinoff they'd like to see from Dead by Daylight, and the answer was a dating sim. So Psyop, the developer behind the Colonel Sanders dating sim, is stepping in to make a killer dating sim.\nAccording to the official site, Hooked on You whisks the player away to Murderer's Island. There, they'll have the chance to get to know four drop-dead Killers and flirt with them, uncovering some dark twists along the way. The Trapper, Huntress, Wraith, and Spirit make up the four romanceable Killers in this tropical paradise. Well, paradise for now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzsuUDPYF3I\nIsland in the sun\nPicking the right dialogue options will let you get to know the Killers, as well as gradually unlock more about them. Psyop and Behaviour are boasting multiple endings for each Killer. And nicely enough, they range from true love to platonic friendship and even bitter loathing. Love to have a little bit of realism in my dating sim.\nNo date's been set yet for Hooked on You, and right now it's only confirmed as coming to Steam. But an overall Very Positive ranking on Steam as of this writing for the KFC dating sim seems to indicate that Psyop knows what it's doing in the realm of virtual courtship. We'll see if Hooked on You's love is a killer later on this summer.\nThe post Hooked on You will let you date four of Dead by Daylight’s killers this summer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I would too, if I had a PS5\nWhen the PS5 was first announced, some fans were shocked to find that the console was going to be white, which was Sony's first time deviating from a black color scheme for the PlayStation since the gray original console released back in 1994. Thankfully, if you're not a fan of a brighter look, Sony has also released different console covers and controllers in a variety of colors. First they released Midnight Black and Cosmic Red colors for the console covers back in January of this year (you know, those being the classic gamer colors), but now there are some new variations on the horizon.\nIntroducing the Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, and Nova Pink console covers. Ooh, aah. The covers are available for both the disc-based and digital-only versions of the PS5, and are available now for pre-order for $54.99 each. While the official release date for the covers is June 17, the matching controllers are also now up for sale, going for a staggering $74.99. I guess it costs to look that good.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1526578609753833475\nPersonally, I love the fun-colored consoles — if this thing is going to sit in plain view, something Sony seemed to want us to do based on the \"artistic\" design of the PS5, I at least like the option of being able to customize what it looks like. I had the limited edition Uncharted 4 PS4 for a while and loved it, so I'm waiting for the day I can get my hands on another console with a fun design, given they make PS5s like that... or that I can get a PS5 at all. At this point, I've waited so long to buy one legitimately, I have no idea when I'll have an opportunity to purchase a PS5.\nOh well, in the mean time it's fun to look at the pretty colors, right?\nThe post Deck out your PS5 with new console covers coming in June appeared first on Destructoid.",

The quartet of qutesy adventures will be available to purchase on PS4 and Nintendo Switch from June 3, available in both digital and physical formats.\nDeveloped by indie outfit Bliss Brain, the Wonder Boy Collection features four titles pulled from the legendary adventures of Ryuichi Nishizawa's fantasy explorer. First on the agenda is 1986's Wonder Boy, which tasks players with guiding our caveman hero through the slippiest, skiddiest platform adventure ever designed. The second title is 1987's Wonder Boy in Monster Land, a classic arcade actioner that introduced typical RPG elements, as well as a fantasy-themed sword-and-sorcery universe.\nhttps://youtu.be/36dXydzrNvc\nNext up is the 1991 arcade Wonder Boy in Monster World, in which the adventurous Shion is guided by four friendly spirits on a quest to defeat the troublesome BioMeka and their army of magical monsters. The fourth title in Wonder Boy Collection is 1994's Monster World IV, which sees new protagonist Asha set out to rescue the four friendly spirits captured by a roving party of evil sorcerers. This entry remained confined to the Sega Mega Drive platform until its latter-day re-release on Nintendo Wii, followed by a full remake in 2020.\nWhile a pretty fun package of titles, it can't be denied that — for licensing and other reasons — so much is missing here. Wonder Boy Collection does not feature the best game in the series, 1989's Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap, nor does it feature the legendary home ports of the first three titles, the Dotemu remakes, nor 2018's pseudo-sequel Monster Boy and The Cursed Kingdom. As such, it's difficult for ININ Games to warrant that \"Collection\" moniker.\nWonder Boy Collection launches on PS4 and Nintendo Switch June 3.\nThe post Wonder Boy Collection brings retro adventure action on June 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, remember it or not, Netflix is finally ready to start talking about it again, and will premiere new footage during June's Geeked Week 2022 event.\nCyberpunk: Edgerunners is a 10-episode series from Studio Trigger, the anime veterans behind popular shows Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Star Wars: Visions. While we have heard very little from the tie-in TV show since Cyberpunk 2077 had its less-than-sparkling release, the original plot outline saw a young punk with nothing to lose divert his life into that of a cybersecurity mercenary, or \"Edgerunner.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRvDL9FChFM\nSince then, we have heard little and seen nothing in regard to the new anime, so Geeked Week will provide the perfect opportunity for Netflix and Trigger to show off the sci-fi adventure, especially now that the furor behind Cyberpunk 2077's launch has, for the most part, died down entirely. In addition to Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, fans will get to see new trailers, cast interviews, and reveals pertaining to other video game adaptations such as the live-action Resident Evil series and the second season of the unfortunately disappointing The Cuphead Show.\nIf you want to be there for all of the hot gossip on the above shows, not to mention the many other releases Netflix has lined up for its 2022-2023 season — including Stranger Things, The Sandman, Spiderhead, Umbrella Academy, and The Sea Beast — then be sure to tune into Geeked Week 2022, which will run from Monday, June 6 to Friday, June 10.\nThe post Netflix to showcase Cyberpunk 2077 and Resident Evil at Geeked Week 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary. \n  \n\n\n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStreets of Rage 4\nPlayStation 4, Xbox One, Swi…",

          "description": "Developer Spiders has announced GreedFall 2: The Dying World, a sequel to its 2019 role-playing game GreedFall.\nThe game takes place three years after the events of GreedFall. Players control a native of Teer Fradee, the first game’s island setting, who is captured and taken to the continent of Gacane. This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.\n\n\nLike the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. \nThe studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. \nThe first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more. We’re curious to see how the sequel builds upon its solid foundation. You can read our GreedFall review here.",

His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.\n“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry.

          "description": "Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. \nThis news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: \nNew Game Announcement!\npic.twitter.com/TIHbrUqmOK\nMay 18, 2022\nAs you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. \nElsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. \nIn the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this new Marvel game is?

Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.\nAlong with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.\nIf you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures.

          "description": "Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. \nThe long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: \n“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” \nTo soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. \nNacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.\" You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. \nTest Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. \n2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.",

          "description": "Ubisoft’s roller derby-inspired Roller Champions finally has a release date, and its inaugural season is only a week away.\nOn May 25, the free-to-play multiplayer title goes live. The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. \n\n\nAs players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. \nRoller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. \nRoller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, \"Onto the Icy Blue.\"\n“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” \n\n\nWe won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. \nAfter watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that Square Enix has news to share in regards to the Final Fantasy VII franchise next month. \nNomura said this in a Japanese live stream about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. \nThe last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. \nAll of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer. Check out Game Informer’s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game after that. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhich Final Fantasy game in development are you most excited to hear about again?

          "description": "Disney has unveiled the first trailer for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the upcoming Marvel series that premieres on Disney+ this August.\nJennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a lawyer juggling an increasingly chaotic life, including working for a newly launched superhuman law division. Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). \n\n\nYou can also check out the official poster below:\nShe-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. \nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June. \nWhat do you think of this first look at She-Hulk?

I won’t tell anyone that either emotion is invalid, but I do take exception to the sentiment that established franchises should stay in their lane and aren’t allowed to stretch their wings to other genres. After all, several of the best games and even series were spawned when their creators flexed an IP’s versatility.

This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.\nIf you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. \n\n\n“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”\nHooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.",

According to Nintendo Life, many projects are in the works, from those already announced to undisclosed titles. Ultimately, the report revealed over 30 games are in the works, including, but not limited to, new ports and remasters. \nThe full report, which can be read here, categorizes the upcoming games and provides clear definitions for each:\nImmersive Core: Titles that have the deepest gameplay and the most hours of content. Examples include our key sports franchises (like PGA 2K and NBA 2K) as well as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption (to name a few). \nIndependent: Externally developed Private Division releases. \nMobile: Any title released on a mobile platform.\nMid-core: Titles that are either an arcade title (like WWE Battlegrounds) or games that have many hours of gameplay, but not to the same extent as an immersive core title. \nNew iterations of prior releases: This includes ports and remastered titles. Sequels would not fall into this category.\nMoreover, a pipeline table in the document states Take-Two is developing 24 immersive core games, including The Quarry for June 10, Marvel's Midnight Suns later this year, Kerbal Space Program 2 (PC) in early 2023, and NBA2K23, PGA Tour 2K23, and WWE 2K23 next year. Ten independent games, 20 mobile games like the GTA Trilogy in 2023, 7 mid-core games, including the long-awaited Tales from the Borderlands sequel, and eight new iterations of prior releases are also on the way. Fans of Take-Two's many development studios undoubtedly have a lot to look forward to. \nIt's hard to guess the future for some of these categories, but what ports and remasters are you anticipating?

It’s easy to get lost in its tranquil cycle of collecting stamps via fetch quests and combat. However, Rising doesn’t have much substance. The whole experience is bland and commits various RPG transgressions, which is disappointing.

          "description": "Kerbal Space Program 2 will remain grounded a while longer. Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.\nCreative director Nate Simpson explained on the project's forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: \n“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” \n\n\nLike its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. \nKerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.\nUnfortunately, Kerbal isn't the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.",

But the news for Warner Bros.' brawler doesn't stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.\nLooney Toons' Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo's Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week's alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won't make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.\nA later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you're not able to get into the closed alpha, you'll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. \nIf you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game's website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.",

If you're a PC player, good thing the modding community is particularly generous with its wacky experiments.

The new feature is kind of like spirit summoning. As PC Gamer aptly points out, it's akin to Skyrim's follower mechanic, meaning that your party members will likely stay with you even after defeating the big bads of a specific point of interest. Moreover, the various characters were rebalanced to fit Elden Ring's exploratory loop and include, Melina, Sellen, Millicent, Ranni, Blaidd, Malenia (and her Rot form!), Radagon, Morgott, Godfrey, and Maliketh among many others.

We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing 2017's Pyre. \nPyre was released on June 25, 2017. After Supergiant struggled to create Transistor, the team adopted a looser \"anything goes\" approach for Pyre. The game blends together disparate elements reflecting the team's interests such as a high-fantasy setting, a large cast of engaging characters, a ritual in the form of a basketball/soccer-like competition, and Oregon Trail-inspired exploration. Tune in to find out how Supergiant concocted the game's centerpiece \"sports\" game, its approach to crafting a larger branching narrative (including an ever-changing end credit song), and which members of the Nightwings we chose to liberate and the ones we abandoned in the Downside.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with video game consultant and former Game Informer editor Suriel Vazquez (@SurielVazquez) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Pyre!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

It was one of my prized possessions, even though the details were lacking. This version of Luke looked more like an elf from the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer claymation film than actor Mark Hamill. His lightsaber was also oddly yellow instead of blue – a detail I always thought was odd.\nThe point being, action figures have come a LONG way since then. Hot Toys' latest Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness action figure looks so realistic it could be in a wax museum. Benedict Cumberbatch's facial detailing is spot on, and the 30 points of articulation allow for many of his spell-casting poses to be recreated. To make sure these spell motions look just like in the movie, Hot Toys includes over a dozen interchangeable hands with fingers pointing every which way. You'll also find five mystic powers to go along with some of the hands to truly sell the effects of the spell.  \nThe figure is 31 centimeters in height and comes with a variety of accessories, like the Book of Vishanti, two sling rings, an amulet, handcuffs, mystic vipers, and so much more.\nHot Toys hasn't given us a price yet, but it's expected to ship in either the third or fourth quarter of 2023.

After a week away on Madrigal with Kwan and Soren, the focus shifts back to Reach and what the UNSC is doing about finding The Covenant and Halo. While the militaristic arm of humanity panics over other planets getting glassed by their alien foes, John and Makee are spending time getting to know each other after their shared vision of the show's namesake.\nWhile the universe's greatest Spartan and the Covenant spy fraternize in the park (and other places), Dr. Halsey continues to meddle in order to advance humanity in her image, threatening the people she's trying to save in the process. Will the good doctor's interference and the union between the main characters result in unity between the two warring factions or make the upcoming battle that much harder? You'll just have to listen to this week's show to find out.\nWhat do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

Hugh Neutron, the duck-loving meme king and father of Jimmy Neutron, arrives this summer. Lastly, Rocko of Rocko’s Modern Life fame is slated for the fall. \nThe announcement trailer below largely focuses on Jenny, who can pummel opponents with rocket-powered fists, zap them with lasers, slice them up with buzzsaws, and utilize other gadgets. Unfortunately, we don’t get any gameplay footage of Hugh or Rocko, but those videos will likely arrive as we approach each character’s launch dates.\nEach fighter is labeled as premium DLC, meaning they come at a price. You can grab Jenny, her Tremorton Joyride stage, and her alternate costume for $4.99. A Universe Pack containing all three characters, along with the new stages and costumes tied to them, goes for $11.99. \n\n\nNickelodeon All-Star Brawl didn’t blow us away (here’s our review), but it's a respectable platform fighter and it’s cool to see developer Ludosity continue to bolster the roster with fan-favorite characters. One has to wonder if these will be the only new faces to grace the game in 2022 given how spaced out they are, and what characters will be added in 2023, if any. \nAre you still playing Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl?
