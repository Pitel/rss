          "description": "We have Castlevania at home.\nIf nothing else, you’ve got to give the Skautfold franchise credit for being unafraid to mix things up. After Skautfold: Shrouded in Sanity introduced the series as a retro-style survival horror, its sequels went on to span the Metroidvania, shooter, and RPG genres. Skautfold: Usurper, the latest release in the series to come to Switch, was the first Metroidvania and boasts key art that's very reminiscent of Aria of Sorrow. Unfortunately, the game isn’t very good. There are some redeeming elements here, but this isn't something that we can enthusiastically recommend.\nThe plot takes place in an alternate 19th-century London, picking up shortly after an alien structure called the Citadel crashed down into the city and began releasing a nefarious ‘Fog’ that drove people insane and turned them into Lovecraftian monsters. You play as Saragat, a dead knight brought back to life by a necromancer named Waltham, who has taken control of Saragat’s body to destroy the keeper of the Citadel and seize its power for himself. Yet, despite the cool premise, the story feels quite poorly written. Dialogue is overall stiff and oddly paced, and it’s difficult to follow the relationships between characters and the vague histories they each present.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I'm a drummer. \"Olivia, don't do that,\" my mum scolds me. \"Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child.\" Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.\r\n\nWell, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various \"effects\" of a non-culinary nature.\nRead more",

Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process.

We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.\r\n\n\r\nMy poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But seeing as how they last about an hour and cost approximately the same as it would for Wales to secede from the United Kingdom, I can only afford to pay an immersive experience what it deserves every so often (the rest of the time I'm honourbound by my fatherland to donate to causes supported by Michael Sheen). I'm therefore pleased that there seems to be an uptick in escape room video games. Plese do more of those, developers.\nRead more",

I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's \"filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before\". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to \"really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling\", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.\nRead more",

It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.\nDark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?\nRead more",

And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.\n“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one.

Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.\nThe tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.\nRead more",

What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.\nRead more",

          "description": "Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.\nRead more",

So there.\nAnd yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun.

It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. \nIt's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.\nWhat I'm saying is: it's still worth it.\nRead more",

Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.\nThat's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel.

Now this is a premium option, with a normal price point of £999, but today with the 48HR20 code it's a slightly more palatable £799 at the Samsung UK store. \nRead more",

More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?\nHaving seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen.

But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games.

Developers Tango Gameworks are adding two new modes to their rhythm slasher in next month's Arcade Challenge update: one where the beat gets faster the longer you survive, and another you could tentatively call roguelike-like where you start off stripped of your abilities.\nThe update trailer also also shows off some new special attacks, starring distinguished robot CNMN and Smidge the tutorial fridge. It's out July 5th, and there's definitely enough to make me want to pop back in. \n\n \nRead more",

Nintendo has just announced that Sonic will return in Sonic Superstars this Fall.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0il5KpfzvCU\nSuperstars is an entirely new game made in the vein of the classic 2D Sonic games. It'll feature modern graphics and we don't just get to play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. We'll get to play them all at the same time in local four-player co-op mode.\nIf you think Fall is too far away, then fret not. Sonic will also return in Sonic Origins Plus this very Friday.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoyoWlOJILc\nOrigins Plus is a collection that features four classic Sonic games in HD, as well as 12 Sonic games from the Game Gear. It also boasts some new features like new challenges, modes, a playable Amy, and even her super form.\nhttps://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1671213321880748032?s=20\nBut as with all things Sonic, the backlash is never too far away. Twitter users are already claiming that the game has been leaked, and fans aren't happy with the quality of the sound of the Game Gear remasters. Twitter user Kirisame states that he has analyzed the audio files and complains that the stereo changes actually make the game sound worse.\nhttps://twitter.com/kirisamemofo/status/1670235195050536961?s=20\nTo learn more about it all and more, stay tuned to Sonic's Twitch or Youtube channels this Friday, June 23, at 8 am PST or 11 am EST.\nThe post Sonic Central stream teasing “upcoming projects” airs on June 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the job is far from over, Season 4 marks another big step forward and we remain committed to this journey with the Halo community.\"\nOf course, 343 Industries was one of the Microsoft subsidiaries that was hit by layoffs at the start of the year, which forces the dedicated Halo team to prioritize its manpower and talent on the core elements of the sci-fi shooter. The studio has recently spoken of its aim to improve many areas of Halo Infinite's gameplay, with incoming additions such as a new career ranking system and the return of Infection Mode, both of which launched this week as part of Season 4's content.\nHalo Infinite is available now on Xbox and PC platforms.\nThe post Narrative cutscenes to be axed from future Halo Infinite seasons appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Parental Advisory Explicit Content\nTwitch is adopting a new range of labels and tags with which it hopes creators can better classify mature content on their respective channels — The new tags, which are live on the platform right now, are the latest step in the company's efforts to improve community safety on the popular streaming service.\nInitially, the site had a catch-all \"Mature Content\" label, but the new tags hope to be a little more specific as to what audience members can expect when visiting one of the site's millions of channels.\nThe new labels are:\nMature-Rated Games\nSexual Themes\nDrugs, Intoxication, or Excessive Tobacco Use\nViolent and Graphic Depictions\nSignificant Profanity or Vulgarity\nGambling\nWhile the Mature labels warn Twitch viewers of a channel's content, they are not a replacement nor a \"Get Out of Jail Free Card\" for anyone breaking the site's Community Guidelines, which remain unaltered at the time of writing. Streamers may receive warnings for failing to accurately label their content, with potential blocks for repeat offenders. That said, Twitch also notes that a streamer will not be auto-suspended for mislabelling their channel. You can check out the full details on the new labeling system on Twitch.\nTwitch continues to implement and experiment with rules, guidelines, and features in order to combat explicit content on the website. Of course, given the mammoth nature of the streaming platform, moderation has been a momentous issue for the Twitch team, which has led to false positives, user confusion, and the controversial application, (and sometimes retraction) of security and marketing measures.\nThe post New Twitch labels hope to better classify mature content appeared first on Destructoid.",

I don't think there was a lack of big reveals; we got a new 2D Mario, an absolutely gorgeous remake of a classic Mario RPG, and the first two Pikmin games are hitting the Switch later today.\nStill, for those with high hopes—especially given that this Direct is happening within the Not-E3 window—or those who don't care too much about Mario, I could see this falling a bit flat for them.

They will be targeting it on November 3, 2023 on Switch.\nAs the name implies, you’re going to have to get off the couch. Personally, this is not something I would be excited for, but WarioWare certainly has a way of making me willing to embarrass myself.\nhttps://youtu.be/z4kkqicAeG0\nIt honestly looks great. The trailer shows off the poses you’re supposed to take. True to the series, they’ve been very careful to make you look ridiculous. There’s a person doing a mad squat and another just wiggling. You can also see a whole bunch of cameos from Mario titles and Pikmin. There also appears to be some modernized versions of older Microgames.\nThere’s also going to be local co-op, and there will also be 4-player modes. For 4-players, there's a board game style party mode. I really hope they call the mode \"Super Wario Party.\" I can't be the only one who thought of that.\nI am definitely on board with this. I actually skipped the WarioWare: Get it Together due to a lack of funds, but I really need to get around to it.

Wonder, a brand new 2D platform adventure starring the iconic plumber and his friends. The new title will launch on Nintendo Switch on October 20, 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JStAYvbeSHc\nThe trailer featured what, at first, appeared to be some classic 2D Super Mario action, but soon gave way to an elastic and playable world, featuring growing pipes, talking flowers, lanky Goombas, a night-time mode, and various other strange phenomena. The trailer also showcased the \"Wonder Flowers\" — powerups that can change our hero in all manner of ways, from making him taller, to increasing his jump height, and even turning him into an elephant!\nOther characters are playable, including Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, and Toad, and while the gameplay seems authentic to the 2D Super Mario style, Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks to play with the world and its characters in ways never before experienced, all daubed in a vibrant, \"cartoon\" visual style.

A prime example of this is Penny's Big Breakaway, a new 3D platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAgpRYM2M8\nWhile the game itself doesn't have too many similarities to the typical Blue Blur video game, it does promise a speedrun-centric slant with its Time Attack mode. More importantly, we got lots of yo-yo based attacks, which the titular Penny can modify with various snack-based power-ups. We can already find mentions of unlockable bonus items and secret stages, so it looks like this one will lean heavy on replay value.\nFortunately, this title won't be a Nintendo Switch exclusive.

As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a \"Star Ocean The Second Story R\" was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.\nOriginally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.\nThe \"R\" in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series. Thus, a continuation along these lines is very likely, and very good news for Star Ocean fans.\nOf course, we will be sure to keep you updated should Square Enix be forthcoming with any news.\nSquare Enix support website features a logo for a Star Ocean 2 remake [RPGSite]\nThe post Star Ocean 2 remake seemingly leaked on Square Enix site (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Monsters will also include Dragon Quest series favorites alongside completely new creatures for this entry.\nAdditionally, the world will change with the passing of the seasons. While we don't know how expansive this will be in the final game, we have confirmation that certain areas of the world will open depending on the season.\nDragon Quest Monsters is a fantastic spinoff series for a fantastic series, so any new entry is hella welcome in my book. Additionally, it looks like previous Dragon Quest heroes may make a cameo appearance here as well. While last year's Dragon Quest Treasures was nice, I'm excited to see Monsters returning to its roots like this.\nWe'll learn more when Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince arrives on December 1, exclusively for Nintendo Switch\nThe post Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince coming December 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

(That's a big mood.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDmS6Nk0P50\nThe goal is to plumb the depths of the abyss, recovering resources and bringing them back to the surface. Then, back up top, you can do a bunch of base-building and home upkeep. This looks to include forging, farming, animal caretaking, and more.\nIt seems vaguely Rune Factory-ish, with a roguelite twist, and that's a good pitch in my opinion. We'll see how the whole venture comes together later this year, when Silent Hope hits on October 3.\nThe post Silent Hope dives into the action-RPG depths in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

But Super Mario RPG is indeed getting a full fledged remake, cementing 2023 as one of the most wild years in recent gaming history.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r5PJx7rlds\nThe footage we saw during the June 21 Nintendo Direct showed us many familiar locations faithfully recreated in 3D. While the graphical revamp takes center stage, the gameplay does appear to have some extra flourishes. For example, battles show chain bonuses and a mysterious percentage meter on the left side of the screen. What do they mean? I don't know! And I'm dying to find out!\nWhile potential new details about this upcoming remake remain scarce, just seeing Geno and Mallow in full 3D is enough for my hype. Super Mario RPG is one of the best SNES games of all time, and now is a great time for both old and new fans to experience this classic once again.\nThe Super Mario RPG remake will land this year on November 17 for the Nintendo Switch.

It was a hurried announcement directly after the reveal that Princess Peach was getting her own game, and both are due out in 2024.\nHere's all Nintendo had to say about it after the stream:\n\"A visually enhanced version of Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon, originally released on Nintendo 3DS, is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. Can Luigi summon the courage to save Evershade Valley? Explore haunted mansions full of spooky specters and bone-chilling challenges next year. More information will be available in the future.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7t5jnpkCkI\nClassic \"more info in the future!\" For reference, the announcement starts at 42:30, and Nintendo declined to provide a separate trailer for Dark Moon Switch.\nAlthough the 3DS had a pretty firm install base in 2013, getting this series out to a new audience is a great thing. Luigi's Mansion is kind of an unsung franchise for Nintendo, and it does well enough to continue on: I'll take anything I can get!

They may have slowed their production in terms of overall SKUs released each year, but they exist nonetheless. Nintendo is also periodically restocking figures that have a lot of interest a few times a year (typically for first-party lines), and this time, Zelda is stepping up to the plate.\nThe announcement comes via a tweet from Nintendo of America this week, which revealed that \"previously available amiibo figures from The Legend of Zelda series have returned.\" Although the tweet just mentions the Skyward Sword Link and Bokoblin figures in particular, there is a wider restock of the Zelda line going on due to the recent release of Tears of the Kingdom (which has extensive amiibo functionality with Zelda figures and beyond). If you want them, act fast! Check out your local retailer (or any number of online storefronts like Amazon, Best Buy, or Target) and grab them at MSRP while you can. Typically the window for restocks on rarer figures is a mere few days, so hunt away if you need them.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1671284309972463616\nHere's a quick reminder of all of the new figures announced for 2023:\nSuper Smash Bros.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.\nBooster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.\n\n\nWave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer.

The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. \n\n\nThis enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks.

During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.\nWhile the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider.

From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.\n\n\nThe main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.\nYou'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.\nFinally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.\nIf you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.",

          "description": "Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.\n\n\nTitled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.\nThe first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.\nWhile the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.\nNo specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.",

          "description": "Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.\nYou can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.\nAs you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.\nThe recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.\nFor more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here.

What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry.

Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.\nJust to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.\nJune 18, 2023\nHere, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be \"deeply involved\" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will \"introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe,\" according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.\nIn addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:\nGiven the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

          "description": "The next game coming to Nintendo Switch Online is Fire Emblem. \nMore specifically, Nintendo has announced that the Game Boy Advance version of Fire Emblem, otherwise known as Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, is coming to its subscription service for all Expansion Pack subscribers next week on June 23. This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. \n\n\nA prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. \nFire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week. While waiting for Fire Emblem to hit the library on June 23, read Game Informer's review of Fire Emblem Engage. \nAre you going to check out Fire Emblem next week?

Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. \n\n\nThe first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. \nThis update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. \nHi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.\nDeveloper Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. \n\n\nWe awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, \"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline.

Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. \n\n\nDead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. \nFor more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania.

Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.\nThe collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.\n\n\nThe Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.\nApollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

Knowing Ubisoft’s pedigree, I imagined what Frontiers of Pandora might look like: something between Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry. After a special behind-closed-doors presentation during Ubisoft’s summer gaming event, I can say I was spot on. \nMost interesting to me, instead of controlling an Avatar, which is meant to resemble Pandora’s native Na’vi,…",

The reveal shows smuggler Kay Vess sneaking and shooting her way through a galaxy far far away. There's a lot going on in this trailer, so let's break it down.\nThe demonstration starts with Kay trying to make her way out of a deadly situation. While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind. It's exciting to see a companion like that as more than just a cute, (hopefu…",

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.\nYou can also check out a new trailer for the game below.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.",

The game lets players control Ezio (AC II), Connor (AC III), and Kassandra (AC: Odyssey) in first-person through an original story that lets players parkour, hide in the shadows, and assassinate targets in the more immersive avenue that VR provides. Check out the CG trailer below. \n\n\nWe next saw footage of gameplay from Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade, the free-to-play mobile title set in ancient China that was announced last September. The brief montage showed off shots of the detailed open world and the signature assassin’s gameplay. Jade is the first title that lets the player build their own protagonist from scratch, and you can register now to join the game’s first playable beta.",

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
