They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as \"completely abrupt and impersonal\". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.\n Read more",

          "description": "Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO \"fake\", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.\nThis follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.\nRead more",

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.\nWe’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment.

          "description": "True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall.

Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around \"eight to 12 hours a day\", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as \"Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon\". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.\nRead more",

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.\nThe developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.\nYou may or may not find all that \"soothing\" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look \"a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman\", which I would translate to \"my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here\".

For those who care about her combat ability, though, is Mizuki worth the Primogems?\n\n\nIs Mizuki good in Genshin Impact?\n\n\nMizuki’s power level is fairly mediocre. She’s not terrible, but she’s not very strong by 5-star standards. In fact, she’s about on par with the 4-star character Sucrose. Sucrose even has the advantage of greater team flexibility since she can use Normal Attacks. You can think of Mizuki as an alternative to Sayu in terms of gameplay. She uses her Burst to heal, and stays on-field to deal Swirl damage with her Skill. To summarize, I don’t recommend pulling for Mizuki unless you really like her as a character.

That said, if you need more specific or subjective information from experienced Project Trigger players, then check out the Discord server. It’s where you can ask about community opinions on everything and get a better and more informed picture of the game.\n\n\nIt’s also where you can find the latest codes and tier lists. Also, it’s excellent for tracking announcements and updates. I often browse around sneak peeks and patch notes for the latest buffs, nerfs, and new content being added. The game is always growing so giveaways and special events are always mentioned in the Discord first as well.\n\n\nAnd that’s how to access the official Project Trigger Trello and Discord.

She also has only 4* Weak Foot and 4* Skills, making her slightly limited in front of the goal.\n\n\nPark has decent roles, and 90 Pace and 92 Dribbling is decent.

Using a Forecast Tower is among your weekly objectives, but you won't find any quest markers for them. Instead, you'll have to wait until a few storm circles pass.\n\n\nWhere to find Forecast Towers in Fortnite\n\n\nForecast Towers spawn around your Fortnite map just before the third storm circle is announced. They'll appear as satellite dish icons on your map, giving you their exact locations. You'll usually find two or three during each match.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, these locations change per round. While the buildings will stay in the same spots, only certain ones will activate during your match. In other words, even if you camp a forecast tower, it may not necessarily turn on, forcing you to find a new one.\n\n\nHow to use Forecast Towers in Fortnite\n\n\nOnce you approach an active forecast tower, you'll find a large tower and a small building with a terminal inside. However, you won't be able to unlock the terminal without obtaining an access key. It's time to fight some enemies.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMore specifically, you'll have to defeat enemies guarding the forecast tower. They'll either spawn right outside the tower or patrol nearby, as shown by a face map icon. They don't have much health, but they can still deal some solid damage if you fight them for a while.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe guards you encounter will depend on the current Fortnite season. While some seasons had Latverian henchmen, others, like Chapter 6: Season 1, have demon grunts and lieutenants. Upon defeating a guard, they'll drop a Forecast Tower Access Card, which you can use on the terminal to use the forecast tower and finish Fortnite's story and weekly quests.\n\nThe post How to find and use Forecast Towers in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Píšu několikrát \"pravděpodobně\", protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).\n(Tato recenze je bez spoilerů, pokud za spoilery nepokládáte to, co je vidět na plakátech a v trailerech.)\nTakže: Drama je rozehráno atentátem na nového…",

Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
