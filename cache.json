Spilling colour, nostalgia, and a little bit of childlike glee onto the pages of a notebook, this is a heartwarming tale of two friends at the end of a school day and a humorous take on a heroic adventure.\nThe story is set out by Kenta, a ten-year-old aspiring game developer with unmatched ingenuity. The construction of Cardboardia, alongside a cast of unforgettable characters, resides on the desk in a classroom, and each element of the game adopts a lovingly handmade appearance. Comprised of puppets, cardboard cutouts, and some pretty incredible origami, Kenta is keen to share the tale of Wright with the player from the moment you boot up the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Despite earning somewhat lukewarm commerical success when compared to the likes of Super Mario and Animal Crossing, Metroid has more than earned its place in the hearts of Nintendo gamers worldwide; heck, you only need to look at some of the reactions to Nintendo's announcement of Metroid Prime 4 to appreciate just how impactful the franchise has become.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For those not residing in that modest nub of the Venn diagram, let’s see if you’ve moved there by the end of the page.\nSo let’s start with the “making sense” bit. “Kureshin” is the Japanese shortened name for Crayon Shin-chan, a manga series and anime sitcom about a two-kids-and-a-dog Japanese family, focused on Shinnossuke (Shin-chan), their impish five-year-old. It’s been running since 1990 and uses a distinctively wonky art style, a long way from the wet-eyed haircuts grimacing against strobing parallax some exported anime brings to mind. Shin-chan spends his time infuriating his parents, causing arguments, leaping into wild make-believe, repenting and making up, in a neat loop of boisterous hyperactivity and happy sentimentality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

          "description": "When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?\nAfter spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.\nWhere am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.\nThis, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.\nRead more",

Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. \nIt tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.\nRead more",

All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. \nToday Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don't think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill.

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.\nRead more",

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series.

          "description": "Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as \"The Laughing Deer Show\". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

          "description": "Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you're a manager with a budget and you've got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you're not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you're in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.\nThe job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you're able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that's uniquely yours.\nRead more",

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.\nRead more",

The ad, which quickly became widespread on social media, points to the two newcomers being DC anti-hero Black Adam and Stripe, the malevolent antagonist of Joe Dante's 1984 horror-comedy, Gremlins.\nhttps://twitter.com/IronWolfNet_/status/1559045986156089344?s=20&t=s8OORNqs-xQfHhE6_en-Ag\nDebuting way back in 1945, and under the license of Fawcett Comics, Black Adam was an arch enemy of Shazam! (then still \"Captain Marvel\"). Originally an ancient Egyptian predecessor of Shazam, DC Comics has readapted Black Adam time and again as a frequent villain, sometime anti-hero, and othertime straight hero. Perhaps one of the single most alliance-jumping characters in comic book history, Black Adam will soon make his big-screen debut in a new movie, portrayed by Dwayne Johnson.\nStripe is the closest Gremlins has to an antagonist, given the character's nature as the self-appointed alpha of the mischievous monsters. A clone of good guy Mogwai Gizmo, birthed after the latter was splashed with water, Stripe leads his brethren on a Christmas rampage through the town of Kingston Falls, afforded a disgusting new form after tricking owner Billy Peltzer into feeding him after midnight.\nYou're already singing the theme tune, aren't you?\nMultiVersus open beta is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can check out the official season one patch notes, complete with their respective nerfs and buffs, on the official website.\nThe post Leaked ad appears to reveal two new MultiVersus characters appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'd get my Jason X on.\nGoing out and about is a little risky at the moment, especially for my aged goth-ass flesh, so I will likely be spending much of the weekend cooped up indoors, staying cool with Tango ice lollies (other brands are available) and doing my very best to get on top of a truly horrendous bout of Bad Brains, (not the D.C. band). The weekend is here, and I'm very happy to see you again. I hope that …",

In my younger days, I had rented it and written it off for a reason I think is perfectly valid: all the environments look the same. Watching him play through it didn’t prove otherwise. Hybrid Heaven is metallic corridors from eyebrows to toe-hairs. But something about the way he was enjoying it was infectious.\nAfter he completed it, he told me that “he probably wouldn’t have tolerated it without save states.” That is not glowing praise, but the experience was enough to keep Hybrid Heaven rolling around in my head for years until I finally found it for a reasonable price. By now, the game has been built up in my mind that I almost had to play through the entire thing. Good or bad.\n\n…",

Games like World of Demons and Star Trek: Legends are enjoyable gacha games in part because you don’t have menus popping up constantly goading you into dropping cash in them.

With the exception of some UI upgrades or a musical score, the vast majority of IF is just simple text on a screen that the player clicks through. It exists in the space between my two favorite things: literature and video games. Technically interactive fiction got its start in the late 1970s with text adventures like Zork, but now the world of text-based games has taken on a whole new life.\nI’ve always dabbled in the world of IF, but when I came across this thread on Twitter, it reminded me that the community surrounding this genre is mo…",

          "description": "Hopefully it lives up to the series' potential\nAvatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most beloved TV series of all time (and for good reason), and it's about damn time it got another video game adaptation. This week Square Enix and Navigator Games announced that they're collaborating on an Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game for Android and iOS, which is launching in Canada, South Africa, and Sweden this month ahead of a wider release.\nThe game, titled Avatar: Generations, will be a free-to-play RPG that will include squad-based battles and in-game adventure sequences (whatever that means), according to GameSpot. Players will be able to explore an open world, as well as relive iconic story moments from the show as well. We can also expect to see all of our favorite characters like Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa, and Momo. Future updates will give players access to Avatar Kyoshi, Korra, Roku, and explore all four of the nations.\n\nSquare Enix and Navigator put up an official website for the Avatar: Generations, although it's basically empty as of now, so it's worth coming back to in a bit when they release more information. There's also no hint as to when the full release of Generations might be, but considering it's a mobile launch, odds are it won't take as long as the typical game releases we're used to.\nI'm honestly shocked that the games industry hasn't given ATLA more love up until this point, considering how big and enthusiastic the fanbase is. I'm sure most of us would prefer a full AAA treatment over an Avatar mobile game, but it's a good place to start.\nThere have certainly been some good mobile games based on bigger franchises in the past few years — Fallout Shelter being chief among them. Hopefully if Generations does well, some of the bigger studios will catch on to the potential that this franchise has to make some really kickass games.\nThe post An Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game is launching this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Open-world magic RPG Hogwarts Legacy has hit a new delay, and is now aiming for a February 10, 2023 launch.\nIt's the latest 2022 game to get hit with a delay into next year, and it comes with an addendum too. While the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions of Hogwarts Legacy are set for February 10, 2023, the Nintendo Switch version has no date. News about the Switch's date will be revealed soon, the Hogwarts team says.\nhttps://twitter.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1558121248814759939\nIt's the latest delay for Avalanche Software's game, which had already been pushed out of 2021 and into this year. We did get a gameplay deep dive earlier this year, where we saw a bit of what wizards and witches can get up to in the wizarding world. But it looks like players will be waiting a bit longer to get their owl.\nBack to school\nThe delay isn't totally out of the ordinary, as several major 2022 games have been moving out and into later dates. Earlier this week, Firaxis and 2K confirmed that Marvel's Midnight Suns has been delayed out of its October date, only specifying that it will launch sometime before the end of March '23.\nEven Metal Slug Tactics is taking a little extra time. Only a few, like God of War Ragnarok, are standing firm in this coming holiday window.\nA little extra time will hopefully at least be good for the team, in helping them deliver the experience they want to. I'm admittedly not too keen on Hogwarts Legacy, especially as it's based on a series whose author seems determined to keep chipping away at any goodwill the books garnered. WB Games did note in 2020 that Rowling isn't directly involved in the game. But hey.

I dig the mix of survival elements and home design, and having to build a nice little home in a world that actively wants you gone. Space for Sale seems ripe for co-op hijinx and plenty of goofs in trying to make some homes on a dangerous planet.\nNo firm date has been set yet, but Space for Sale is coming soon to PC.

          "description": "It's the hard-knock life for us\nPartway through today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, which is low-key giving me old silly Konami E3 vibes, we got an updated look at Gothic 1 Remake. The 2001 role-playing game is coming back on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and whether you're in or not will likely depend on your connection to the original back in the day — or maybe a fascination with of-their-time games returning with glossed-up remasters or remakes.\nHere's a cinematic trailer to (re)introduce the mining colony and the Minecrawlers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf4Wd29mRqw\nPlayers will \"manage the fate of a lifetime convicted prisoner who must survive in a world of wild animals, creatures, and convicts of dangerous reputation.\"\nGame developer Alkimia Interactive promises a \"modernized combat system\" for Gothic 1 Remake, though it hopes to retain an overall \"faithful\" vibe. That's a tricky balancing act for any revival, especially one with a cult following. 20 years can be an eternity in gaming.\nIn December 2019, THQ Nordic released a Gothic Playable Teaser on Steam, which generated no shortage of fan feedback to take into consideration. As a first introduction, it arguably missed the mark. But as a public test, I think it served its purpose.\nDespite this latest promotional push, Gothic 1 Remake doesn't have a release date. It's still tagged with a vague \"coming soon\" on Steam, and will also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S — when it's ready. The slow but steady burn continues.\nTHQ Nordic sure has an interesting collection of games these days.\nThe post Gothic 1 Remake has a trailer, but no word on a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Head back to Derceto Manor\nA horror series is getting a new lease on life under THQ Nordic. Alone in the Dark, a \"reimagination\" of the '90s cult-classic survival horror game, is in development.\nThe game was revealed today as part of the THQ Nordic showcase, showing off the setting, gameplay, and more. Pieces Interactive is heading up development, as part of THQ Nordic under the Embracer Group umbrella.\nAlone in the Dark will return to the Derceto Manor, with an original story that will still feature some characters and themes from the '90s trilogy.\nPlayers can once again play as either Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood. Levels and cutscenes will change, depending on which character you're controlling at that moment in time.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acch6-3QEWs\nPieces Interactive will try to capture a gothic American South look, mixed in with noir, the Roaring '20s, and Lovecraftian horror. Mikael Hedberg, the writer behind Soma and Amnesia, is on board to pen the story for Alone in the Dark.\nYou are not alone (in the dark)\nDetails about the new game leaked out early today, ahead of the official reveal. While some of the wind was taken out of the sails there, it does seem like people are eager to see what Alone in the Dark will do with this second wind.\n\nRemakes and reimaginings have gone pretty well for the survival horror genre as well. At least, they have for Resident Evil, which has been seeing steady remakes of many of its numbered games, with Resident Evil 4 due up next.\nAlone in the Dark, meanwhile, has toiled in the shadows for a while. It hasn't seen a new entry since 2015's Alone in the Dark: Illumination, which was not very well-received. Even the entry before it didn't go quite so well.\nA return to the roots of the series might be what Alone in the Dark needs. We'll see if Pieces and THQ can deliver it.\nThe post Alone in the Dark is coming back for more scares appeared first on Destructoid.",

As per usual, the bonus works for any game mode.\nAs a reminder, QuakeCon is not live in person this year — instead, it's happening digitally. Bethesda has planned \"new streaming programming, online meetups, giveaways, charity opportunities, the virtual BYOC, and more.\" It also promises that it's \"committed\" to an in-person event in 2023.\nDouble SCORE (season pass XP) is also live now until August 16 at 12PM PT\nIn a slightly more complicated situation, Fallout 76 encountered some issues earlier this week in terms of maintenance. Bethesda notes that it \"ran quite a bit longer than we had originally anticipated,\" and as a result, they're doing the classic \"you get a bonus, and you get a bonus\" thing to make up for it.\nSo, everyone can earn double SCORE, which essentially amounts to season pass leveling XP.

Well, justlookingfordragon did!\nAmazingly, the entire exercise is framed as a self-imposed mission, as many Breath of the Wild activities often are. In this case, they opted to take photos of the Yiga clan imposters they find out on their travels, then track them down based on those photos. As they point out, \"none of the Yiga impersonate 'important' characters: most are just wandering people with a couple lines of random dialogue.\" This actually kind of fits with the theme of just blinding in by taking an ordinary person's identity.\n\nZelda: Breath of the Wild Yiga clan mystery solved\nIt turns out justlookingfordragons also seemingly figured out better ways to spot the Yiga imposters. They actually only double as Hylians or Hylian-adjacent races (which might be something you already noticed, but is nice to get confirmation on after all this research), and never take the identity of a child or an older resident (or any other race).\nThey even provided a helpful map (above) for spotting stationary Breath of the Wild Yiga clan members — and you can save and load using a campfire to reset them. If you're remotely interested in how the Yiga clan operates, the breakdown is worth the full read.

Kobayashi started out as a key coder for the groundbreaking survival horror title Resident Evil, with the following years seeing him rise through Capcom's ranks as a planner, associate producer, and eventually executive producer on titles such as Dino Crisis, killer7, Devil May Cry, and the Sengoku Basara franchise.\nKobayashi's move to NetEase Games can be seen as another step in the studio's desire to become a bigger play both within the games industry and on the global stage. NetEase already works as a China-based partner to Activision Blizzard, and recently announced the opening of its first U.S.-based studio, Jackalope Games. NetEase Games has been searching for notable staff members over the past year, which included courting Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.

There, they find a rampaging Heatran and the commanders of Team Galactic, who are determined to find their missing leader by opening a gate between dimensions.\"\n\nI kind of love the idea of mining a previous region/generation for more story, just like the Pokemon Legends game did before.

It's the first code that highlights Ash's team, and more codes will come later for Dragonite (August 26), Gengar (September 2), Sirfetch'd (September 9), and Lucario (September 16). It's a neat little promo that also hits a little close to the anime, which is cool. The code is \"GANJ0UAG0882,\" and you'll enter it via the mystery gift system.\nWith that in mind, I hope Nintendo and Game Freak step things up with Scarlet and Violet.

And even educationally show off some gameplay!\nThe best part is that in true Splatoon fashion, you really don't need to understand another language to pick up on these commercials. The fun is universal, as each character below is shown being attacked by ink in real life, and fights back with some weapon at their immediate disposal. That includes an umbrella (Brella), bow and arrow (Tri-Stringer), bucket (Slosher), and a brush (Octobrush).\nThey really nail the vibe of Splatoon, and have made me more excited for the next entry than a lot of the official announcements so far. There's something special about hearing the Splatoon soundtrack, listening to that ink noise, and seeing the actual ink color that hits that nostalgia center. I mean Splatoon is \"only\" seven years old, but that's nearly a decade folks! Pretty soon that'll enter \"retro\" territory, depending on where you draw the line.\nEither way, I'm just happy that Splatoon survived, and wasn't a casualty of the Wii U's fantastic fireball of a death.\nSplatoon 3 Brella commercial:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKsWdGeBDYI\nSplatoon 3 Tri-Stringer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1F2N6ihdEk\nSplatoon 3 Slosher:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNBudJb79PY\nSplatoon 3 Octobrush:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYurKPptDm4\nThe post Once again Japan gets the coolest commercials, this time for Splatoon 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. \nWētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” \n“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” \nWētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” \n“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. \nThis new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). \nWhile waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this ends up being?

The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. \nMore specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:\nThis sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change.

Alongside today’s patch notes, though, came a small leak from Player First Games and MultiVersus itself. Twitter user _FireMonkey booted up MultiVersus and saw a Season 1 startup loading screen a bit too early, as reported by Eurogamer. That’s because this startup screen featured two characters not yet revealed for the roster: Stripe, the antagonist from Gremlins, and Black Adam. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \nSlightly Higher Quality image: https://t.co/2QOFC35Wjh pic.twitter.com/idwQgX95Go\nAugust 15, 2022\nAs you can see in the screenshot above, it seems Black Adam and Stripe will be joining the roster sometime in Season 1.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. \nDevil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look.

Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.\nCheck it out for yourself below: \nWelcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD\nAugust 11, 2022\nAs you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18. \nFor more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, check out the game’s first extended gameplay reveal from earlier this summer, and then read our preview of the game after checking it out in June.

Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot 'em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.\nThe tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.\nMarco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu\n@AngryangryD pic.twitter.com/JRKqpnvUQp\nAugust 11, 2022\nMetal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.\nWe’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.",

          "description": "Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). \nNightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. \nSo far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.",

A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.\nNo More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.\nSoccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.\nLet us know what you think of this surprising game announcement in the comments section below!",

Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version. \n[Source: Faz on YouTube via Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of the game running at 60 FPS?

          "description": "Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” \nArc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen.

The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. \nThe new level is called \"Bean Hill Zone\" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a \"Bean Hill Zone\" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.\nThose aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.\nThis isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.\nFall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic.

That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it.

The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period.

This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. \nWhile waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer. \nAre you excited about Splatoon 3? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. \nThis news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. \nIf you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. \nIt’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise. \nAre you excited about a new Fatal Fury game?

She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. \nFor example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion.

          "description": "When Nintendo first introduced the Switch Online classic games catalog featuring NES games, I bemoaned the announcement of what I saw as an inferior content delivery system. Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.\nThen in 2020, something changed.

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",
