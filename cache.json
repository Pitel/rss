          "description": "The \"Holy Grail\" of glitches has been found.\nThere have been so many tricks and glitches discovered in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at this point, we have to wonder just what else there is left to discover. We've seen one that lets you go underwater, a glitch that lets you explore parts of the map that would otherwise be inaccessible, and even one that lets you swim in lava (because why wouldn't you, right?). The majority of glitches are fairly low impact, proving to be little more than fun, minor distractions as you work through the game. The latest one, however, is a big one and has the potential to completely change the way you experience Breath of the Wild.\nIt take a bit of work to accomplish and you'll need a solid collection of items to begin with, but pulling this trick off will effectively allow you to transfer inventory slots to new game saves along with duplicating slots. Do you want to easily carry over the Bow of Light to a new save file? Well, you can! Along with any other item you wish to keep for a new run-through of the game. You can even transfer the items over to a Master Mode run, making the whole prospect of tackling the tougher difficulty setting much more palatable.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

No, not the 900 little tree-guys that are the bane of everyone's existence, but the speedrunner Koroks, who logged a 24:10 time on June 18th, 2022.\nBeating Player5's previous world record by just five seconds, Koroks' run has a lot of the same tricks as the now-second place run. For starters, they both play in French, which is apparently the best language to zip through cutscenes and dialogue, and it looks like they both do everything in the same order: collecting the bomb, magnesis, stasis, and cryonis powers before grabbing the paraglider, heading to the castle, fighting the blights, then defeating Calamity Ganon and the Dark Beast.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"There's a kill screen comin' up!\".\nIf you're familiar with the classic Donkey Kong arcade game, then you'll have undoubtedly heard of the kill screen. For those not in the know, the game essentially features a level known as the 'kill screen', whereby the in-game timer will be so low that's it's impossible to complete the stage as a result of a programming bug, thereby \"killing\" Mario once the timer reaches zero and ending the game. The kill screen occurs at level 22 and reaching this point of the game is exceptionally difficult, even for the most skilled of players.\nImagine our surprise, then, to find out that two players have not only successfully reached the kill screen, but have done so by combining their skills and taking turns in navigating through the game's stages. To our knowledge, a two-player kill screen had not been achieved prior to this, so we reached out to Luke Brynycz - who accomplished the feat alongside David Lyne - to hear more about how they went about the completing the challenge.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "There are plenty of other games incoming!\nDespite the strong implication that a Nintendo Direct will finally take place on June 29th (along with official confirmation of a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct this week!), we were pretty convinced that Nintendo would announce and host a Direct during the week of \"not-E3\" when all the other major publishers were showing off their own goodies. As each showcase concluded, however, a niggling thought started to burrow its way into our minds: \"what if Nintendo just doesn't do one?\". It's a frightening prospect since Nintendo has been a pretty consistent presence during the week of E3, whether it's actually showcasing games at a live event, or simply hosting a Direct around the same time.\nThat's clearly not happening this year, and while yes, we know there still may be a Direct at the end of the month, it still hurts, y'know? But it's not all doom and gloom, as our lovely video team (and Kate!) can attest to. They spend a good half an hour going through some of the more overlooked gems hidden amongst the plethora of announcements this month, showcasing some upcoming Switch titles that you will definitely want to keep an eye on as you wait for the inevitable \"big Direct\" to drop.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Picture perfect or underdeveloped?\nAfter the monumental impact of games like Amnesia, Outlast, and Hideo Kojima’s doomed Silent Hills teaser P.T, horror fans have witnessed somewhat of a resurgence of the genre after franchises like Resident Evil and Dead Space started leaning toward more over-the-top action. While some fans have since taken umbrage with the focus on vulnerability and the distinct lack of any weaponry in many modern horror titles, there’s no denying their effectiveness at making you break out in a cold sweat and reach for a clean pair of underwear.\nMADiSON is a game that very much leans into that sense of vulnerability and helplessness. You play as Luca, a seemingly normal protagonist who awakens with his hands covered in blood. With little context provided at the start of the game, it’s your job to navigate a series of dark and dreary rooms in order to get to the root of your predicament. The house itself is very reminiscent of games like P.T and Layers of Fear, with odd statues and busts hiding in shadowy corners, CRT monitors flickering in the dark, and lamps that never quite seem powerful enough to light your way adequately.\n\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Mario Strikers: Battle League Football started strong last week at the top of the pile, but has now slipped into third, with both Horizon Forbidden West and LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga taking first and second place respectively. The latter also saw exceptionally strong performance for the Switch, making up 42% of total console sales for the week.\nKirby and the Forgotten Land once again slips out of the top ten, but remains at a comfortably strong position at number eleven. Time will tell whether the game gathers steam again, but with the recent release of three Kirby SP titles on the Nintendo Switch Online service, this may give it a slight boost.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Give yourself a rest!\nIt's always interesting to see just how some games would function if you just... do nothing. Indeed, one of the most famous examples is the Metal Man boss in Mega Man 2. If you simply leave the controller alone upon entering the boss room, your opponent will do nothing until you make the first move; step forward just an inch and Metal Man will instantly start flinging his blades toward you.\nIn a similar case, as pointed out by Twitter user Supper Mario Broth, the mine section within Super Mario RPG will actually play itself if you don't press any input upon commencing the sequence, completing the whole mini-game in a total of 3 minutes and 24 seconds. So that means you can pop the controller down, stick the kettle on, make yourself a nice cup of tea, and come back just in time for the mini-game to complete itself, no bother.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A fairytale of game preservation.\nForest of Illusion, Hard4Games, and Gaming Alexandria have uncovered a pretty huge find in the world of retro arcade ports. Once upon a time, Taito's 1985 arcade predecessor to Bubble Bobble — The Fairyland Story — was due to get a Famicom port back in 1986. This version of the game was only ever spotted in a few magazines back in the day, but the port never came to be.\nMany thought the port had been lost, but now, by a lucky purchase made by retro modder @FenrisRetro delivered the much sought-after cartridge for The Fairyland Story. The game came from the mind of Hiroshi Tsujino (who was also behind Arkanoid), and while it was never as popular as Taito's cute dinosaur puzzle game or The New Zealand Story, it still has the same level of charm as those titles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn't do it justice. Yes, it's a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.\nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that \"an objective review\" from external advisors \"determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence \"suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board.\"\nIn fact, another, separate review of data concludes that \"there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units\" in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, \"based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.\" You can read the SEC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in full here.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a \"farmadventure\", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. \nDevelopers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a \"survival game without survival\"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?\n\n\nAhem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.\nNow, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.\nRead more",

Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.\nRead more",

Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's Taito's very early, genre-blending shmup Space Seeker.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1981, and developed several years after the company's seminal Space Invaders, Space Seeker features several experimental features and modes of gameplay, with Taito attempting to create a true space action epic. Space Seeker consists of two distinct modes: a Star Wars-inspired rail shooter, in which the player guns down enemies from the gunner seat of their vessel; and a side-scrolling shmup, which utilizes varying scroll speed, a wide palette of color, and air and ground-based enemies.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1nkxCKX_ak\nWhile Space Seeker did not quite go on to enjoy the pioneering legacy of Taito's other arcade releases, it's still a very interesting title — viewed as an experimental effort. With its varied gameplay, technical achievements, and even little touches such as its interactive map screen, Space Seeker was trying to be something special, adding both gameplay variety and technical advancements in the space shooter genre. Today, it is obviously quite dated — and undeniably garish — but it still retains a rep as one of the shmup genre's strongest early efforts to rewrite the rulebook.\nSpace Seeker is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Taito’s creative 1981 shmup Space Seeker joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

At one point, I was playing endless amounts of Stardew Valley on an old Lenovo ThinkPad that I used in college, but it didn't really matter because that game could run on a toaster. I once tried to play BioShock Infinite on that same laptop... that one didn't go so well. I've upgraded a bit since then, but it's still a gamble whether or not a game I bought on my PC is going to run on my secondhand gaming laptop. Well now the Xbox App on PC has put out a new feature that could save our skins from downloading games we can't even play — that's right, it can tell you whether or not your computer will be able to run a game before you download it.\nThe way it works is really simple: you select the game you want to potentially download, and right under the install button, you get a message that says whether or not your PC can handle it.\nIn a blog post for the June updates for Xbox PC app, an example photo of the feature says of Sea of Thieves, \"Plays well on similar PCs.\" That's way simpler than having to look through your computer specs, compare them against the game's recommended hardware, and pray. This feature will be especially useful for Xbox Game Pass holders, who of course download games from the Xbox App quite often.\n\nXbox highlights other improvements that they made to the app in that same blog post, including updates to the backend so that everything \"will run smoother and with more reliability.\" They also claim to have made improvements to the app's navigation and search features, but most of that sounds like adding search categories like \"Game to play together\" and \"Side scrollers.\"\nThe post Xbox’s PC app can predict whether your computer can handle a game before you download appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a reminder, Pokemon TV can be accessed via a browser, as well as through a mobile or Switch app.\nYou may recall that the first episode, \"Chase the Beans,\" came out in 2020. This is referred to as \"Scraggy and Mimikyu\" for the official western release. If the calendar is the same as the Japanese rollout, we'll get the more emotional Pancham episode next.\n\nThey'll also come to YouTube in the west later this year\nExpect this Pokemon TV exclusivity to last a while. This is what The Pokemon Company had to say about Poketoons rolling out to platforms other than Pokemon TV :\n\"The series will appear on the official Pokémon YouTube Channel later this fall.\"\n\n\nOr, you can watch them now in Japanese on YouTube\nOr, if you're OK with Japanese-language episodes, you can just watch them all right now, unfettered, via YouTube.\nThe link to the entire playlist of all eight episodes is here. Note that the first episode, Chase and Beans, has no real spoken dialogue; so it's universal in any language.\nThe post Poketoons are finally coming west appeared first on Destructoid.",

Packaged with Ramlethal are Lucifero and her semi-sentient greatswords, an alternate set of arms, and an alternate face plate — so you can have grumpy or grump-and-shouting. Clear stands allow Ramlethal and her swords to defy gravity, giving the impression that they are floating in place. Nice touch.\n\nSo, if you want a teeny world-eater of your very own, then the Ramlethal Valentine Nendoroid is available to pre-order now over at the Good Smile Co. online store. Ramlethal retails for ¥9,500 (roughly $70 USD), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Ramlethal is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2023.

          "description": "The newest entry in the Final Fantasy VII remake project is dubbed Rebirth. The news revealed yesterday confirms that the next entry arrives next winter, and the story of Cloud and pals will continue on. But Rebirth also locks in a few interesting tidbits about Final Fantasy VII Remake itself, which seem to cement the direction being taken with remaking this classic adventure: truly re-making it.\n[This article contains spoilers for Final Fantasy VII Remake.]\nThere was a curiosity, I think, about what the naming convention of this new series would be after the first was simply called Final Fantasy VII Remake. Is the next one “Remake Part 2?” Final Fantasy VII Remake Continued? Or some other equally bizarre naming convention, the kind only Square could concoct?\nWell, the answer is much more …",

          "description": "Juniper is the latest addition\nEvery Xenoblade Chronicles 3 party member reveal has been fantastic, and that includes this new one that showcases Juniper.\nYou can watch her slide in with \"extreme\" energy and use her beam bow in the below video:\nhttps://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1536969465090707456\nAnd this US tweet gives us a bit more background on the character:\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1537532975222489098\nThe \"forest archer\" trope is a tried and true idea, but she really rounds out the cast so far, which has been predominantly melee-focused. An agile stealth-based character sounds like a fun way to mix up your party, and I think alongside of Zeon, I have two front-runners.\nThat \"final party cut\" dilemma is a huge part of JRPGs, and I haven't even played one iota of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and I'm really feeling it. Thankfully you can have a huge party in this game.\nThere's a lot of nuance to some of the systems in the third entry, and I can't wait to get my hands on it and dig in. Hopefully the story will deliver, especially in terms of the pacing. It's one of the biggest things a Xenoblade Chronicles game can struggle with for a lot of people, and there's potential to assuage that fear here.\nThe post The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 party is looking great with every reveal appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mighty Metroidvania returns\nIt's been a bit of a wait, but soon Switch fans will be able to get their furry mitts on of 2021's most undersung releases. Publisher Astrolabe Games announced that dystopian Metroidvania F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch will finally arrive on Nintendo Switch on July 12, priced at $29.99. (Pre-order customers will receive a 10% discount on the price.)\nI probably don't need to pour over this title once again to all y'all, especially those who have followed my coverage to date, but F.I.S.T. is a tough, creative, and surprisingly hi-tech adventure that sees a forgotten war hero forced to take up arms (literally) in order to save his friend from the sinister and oppressive regime that presides over the city and its downtrodden populace. Combining finely-detailed locations and animation, solid voice-acting, and a very deep combat system, F.I.S.T. was one of last year's slickest and most engaging adventures.\nhttps://twitter.com/FISTthegame/status/1537430040031334401?s=20&t=apmaU3Y5J0BOYN4M5wJuAA\nDespite its pulled-back camera and deceptive looks, TiGames' adventure is actually a pretty resource-heavy release, packed out with impressive special effects, fantastically \"live\" locations, and hectic, screen-filling boss battles. It will be interesting to see how it ports to the Nintendo Switch hardware and whether it leaves its humble processor sweating carrots. The publisher says that the Switch edition is aiming for 30 FPS at 1080p resolution docked, and 30FPS at 720p in handheld mode.\nF.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch launches on Nintendo Switch July 12. It is available right now on PlayStation and PC platforms. Microids will release a physical edition on PlayStation and Switch in 2023.\nThe post F.I.S.T.

ARMS is officially five years old as of June 16, 2022, and sadly, it's kind of been forgotten outside of a few references here and there. But you know what? I'm going to briefly talk about it and bring it back into the collective consciousness, even for one day.\nI remember the very first time I played ARMS: it was in a warehouse for a Nintendo press tour, right before it was set to release. I felt the same about it as I did at the time of my review, and how I feel now: it's fun, but it never really reaches its full potential. I would have loved to have played it more, but my local scene was pretty rough, as a lot of folks didn't take to it; or understandably want to take the plunge for $60 (note: this game is still $60 digitally).\nI'm a sucker for these types of arena fighters too! Anything where you can load up four players and go crazy, I'm there. I even played hours of The Bouncer multiplayer! At one point in time I'm pretty sure that was considered a felony.\nFive years on, arguably, the biggest impact the ARMS IP made was as a DLC fighter (Min Min) in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate two years ago. Other than that, outside of a few sticker/logo references, it's faded into a distant memory.\nBut you know what? The memory of ARMS might be faded, but it's not lost...yet. It's still on Switch: a platform that's still going strong and fully supported. And if you own it: maybe boot up one more battle, for old spring's sake.\nThe post ARMS is officially five years old this week, and sadly no one really talks about it appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sitting in the jukebox today are shoto master Ryu, crimestopper Chun-Li, and braggadocious military brat Luke. So crank up the volume, sonny, and let's check 'em out.\nLuke - \"Taking Aim\"\nhttps://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1535351095618248704?s=20&t=U…",

Both Celeste and TowerFall are on sale for five bucks on the Switch eShop.\nThe news comes via Extremely OK Games (the creators behind both titles), and the interesting part of the announcement is that in addition to North America, it's also on sale in Europe: including parts of Europe it's never been on sale before in the past.\nWhile TowerFall is easily better with local players behind it, Celeste is a must-buy in any context. Seriously, if you even remotely enjoy platformers, just get it for that price. It'll last you through the weekend and then some, and odds are you'll be thinking about it long after that. And even if you don't normally like platformers or struggle with them, it has some extra options to tweak to make things a little more manageable.\nYou can find Celeste here on Switch, and TowerFall on sale here. The Switch is a great platform for both! Portability suits Celeste as it has echoes of a Game Boy title, and TowerFall, with its party atmosphere, makes sense for a Nintendo console.\nhttps://twitter.com/exok_games/status/1536839850346696704\nThe post Celeste and TowerFall are currently five bucks on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The sale runs until June 23\nDragon's Dogma is on sale right now, in part to celebrate the announcement of the sequel late last night in an errant Capcom stream.\nSo the general gist of the sale is a roughly 84% off discount on every platform but Switch, where it's 66% off. Here's the breakdown, with links:\nPC/Steam - $4.79 - PC/GOG - $5.09 - Humble Bundle\nXbox (playable on Xbox One/Series X and S) - $4.49\nPSN (playable on PS4 and PS5) - $4.79\nSwitch - $9.99\nFor under five bucks, Dragon's Dogma is definitely worth it. It's one of the wildest games of the last 10 years or so, offering up an epic adventure with all sorts of wonkiness to boot. That price will help the latter elements go down smoother, and given that it's not for everyone, even if you abandon it eventually you won't have spent too much on it.\nIn that sense, the sequel is a massive opportunity to correct the technical sins of its father. It took a long time, but Dragon's Dogma (partially through the Arisen release) garnered a lot of goodwill within the gaming community, as it was an honest effort at a unique open world experience, with a bit of flair. If they can shore things up with an updated RE Engine foundation, it could take off even more.\nThe post Dragon’s Dogma is on sale for under $5 on PC/PS/Xbox: on Switch it’s $10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called \"A Life Sent On.\"\nShared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a \"somber flute-based melody,\" which is played by \"off-seers\" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.\nFor now, I've listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times now (even when writing this!) and it's giving me extremely good vibes for how the game will turn out. Aesthetically it seems to be nailing everything it needs to, as that's arguably been one of the stronger points of the series from the start: outdoing other similar games on the same hardware.\nHopefully we get even more quality of life upgrades and a killer story. There's a lot to improve upon in the second core game mechanically.\nListen to the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 track A Life Sent On\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1534828335804649474\n[Update: And another song just dropped!

It'll join the newer 2021 iteration on the same platform.\nOriginally released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64, the picture-taking simulator became an instant cult classic. In a sense, it's the perfect game to come to a subscription service, as the concept is kind of out there, to the point where a lot of folks would never go out of their way to seek it out, but if a lot of those same people gave it a shot, they'd really enjoy it.\nThe Nintendo 64 side of things has been particularly slow-going, as far as the expansion pack is concerned. So originally Nintendo launched the service back in October with nine games. Since then they've doled out an additional game per month, including Paper Mario, Banjo Kazooie, Majora's Mask, F-Zero X, Mario Golf, Kirby 64, and now Pokemon Snap 64. That's a grand total of 16 games. The Genesis side has fared a little better, as Nintendo generally drops three or more games at once on that expansion pack line, albeit at a less regular cadence.\nSwitch Online is kind of all over the place in terms of value. Hopefully it'll improve at some point as early as this year.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1537604982043725824\nThe post Pokemon Snap 64 is coming to Switch Online next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever. Plus, at the end of the day, in many cases, the original game is still there for me to play should I wish to do that. \n\n\nHowever, all this talk and speculation…",

That’s because Nintendo has revealed that a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 direct is happening this week. \nTune in on 6/22 at 7am PT for a livestreamed #XenobladeChronicles3 Direct presentation featuring roughly 20 minutes of information about the upcoming RPG adventure for #NintendoSwitch. pic.twitter.com/x3pRs0EYRA\nJune 20, 2022\nAs you can see, this direct is not going to be the one many people were expecting; you know, the one where Nintendo discusses its plans for the rest of 2022 regarding the Switch. Instead, we’re getting 20 minutes of Nintendo’s next big release, Xenoblade Chronicles 3. If you’re excited about Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, then Wednesday is going to be your favorite day this week. \nWhile waiting for the direct, check out the reveal trailer of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and then read about how its release date moved from September to July. \nAre you excited about Wednesday’s direct? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Evil West is the upcoming Wild West action game from developer Flying Wild Hog, the studio behind the fast-paced Shadow Warrior series, and it’s due out this September. It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. \nNow, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. \nFor more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West. \nAre you excited to check out Evil West this September? Let us know in the comments below!",

This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.\nReleasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.\nMurph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.\nBelow are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. \n\nIn a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: \n“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”\nIf you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.\nWhere on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. \nThe Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. \nFans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. \nAnother Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development. \n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

          "description": "At long last, the second chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake was revealed during today’s 25th anniversary stream. It’s called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it launches next winter, or towards the end of 2023, for PlayStation 5. \nA cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today's video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what will be a three-game series. \n\n\nBe sure to follow the links below to read about the other big announcements from today's presentation:\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion announcement\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake confirmed to be a three-game series\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches on Steam tomorrow",

          "description": "As part of Capcom's Dragon's Dogma 10th-anniversary celebrations, a sequel has finally been announced. Dragon's Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.\n\n\nThe announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that's passed since Dragon's Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game's director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name \"Dragon's Dogma II,\" which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.\nBefore the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon's Dogma. It's a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.\nThere's no date for Dragon's Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company's RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.\nWhat do you want to see from the newly-announced Dragon's Dogma sequel? Let us know in the comments!",

Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.\nShredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Events like Steam's Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.\nThe ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of \"show floor\" demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren't complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.\nXbox isn't ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.\nBatora: Lost Haven\nBroken Pieces\nSevered Steel\nTinykin\nSome of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can't wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.",

          "description": "Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. \nFollowing that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. \n\n\n“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'\"\nSmith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. \nOf course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. \n[Source: IGN via GamesRadar]\nAre you going to play Redfall solo or in co-op?

          "description": "Bethesda and Xbox gave Starfield the spotlight during its recent weekend showcase, revealing more than 15 minutes of new footage and information from director Todd Howard. \nThe studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.\nYes, dialogue in @StarfieldGame is first person and your character does not have a voice. pic.twitter.com/A8384m6rGN\nJune 13, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. \nI’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. \nStarfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.\nFor more, read Game Informer’s Starfield analysis after its recent gameplay showing, and then check out this story about Todd Howard confirming that Fallout 5 is the next game Bethesda Game Studios will develop after Elder Scrolls 6 (which is the next game the studio will release after Starfield). \nWhat are your thoughts on Bethesda RPG dialogue?

          "description": "In a video interview with IGN, Bethesda’s Todd Howard divulged additional details about Starfield. He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. \nSpeaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:\n\"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.\"\nFollowing up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield's main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. \nThe game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. \nStarfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: IGN]",

While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they're always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.\nThis version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it's floating above its stand. While I haven't seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.\n\nThis San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a \"2022 Summer Convention Exclusive\" sticker or the \"2022 San Diego Comic-Con\" sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn't guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention's grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.",

          "description": "Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show's end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.\n\n\nThe Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.\nThe other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it's nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don't expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.\nIf you can't wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it's available to purchase right now on Steam.",

To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.\nMeanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.  \n\n\nIn addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).\n\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. \n\n\nThe trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. \nGoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.\n[Source: IGN]",

          "description": "Dying Light 2 Stay Human's roadmap revealed five years of planned DLC. A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first \"Chapter,\" bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. \nSo, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. \nOf course, there's also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we're talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. \nLike its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden's already-harrowing journey.\nWill you be diving into the 1.4.0 update today?

          "description": "Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.\nExoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.\n\n\nThose mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.\nInterestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.\nCapcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.\nExoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.",

          "description": "Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. \nDirector Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. \n\n\nWe then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. \"We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original,\" Hirabayashi said during the presentation. \"Of course, there will also be thrilling battles.\"\nYou'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. \nI'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.",

          "description": "Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today's Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.\n\n\nIn this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.\nCapcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.\nLastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.\nIf you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.",
