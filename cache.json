          "description": "Your wish is granted.\nAbout five years ago, a no-name studio called Sabotage wowed audiences when it put out The Messenger, a creative and innovative action platformer that quickly set itself apart from the deluge of similar retro-flavored titles releasing in the indie space. Empowered by that game’s deserved success, the team then began work on its dream project, a retro JRPG called Sea of Stars inspired by the likes of Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana. Some doubted the small studio’s ability to deliver such a different experience from its debut release, but we’re happy to report that any such doubts can be resolutely put to rest. Sea of Stars ticks all the boxes and executes its vision near-flawlessly, presenting players with a fun, engaging, and thoroughly excellent new entry in the JRPG genre.\nSea of Stars opens in an ancient library, where a mysterious archivist tells you a story that takes place in the same world as The Messenger, thousands of years before the events of that game. An evil god called The Fleshmancer created a few monstrous Dwellers before disappearing, and each of these creatures could turn into a World Eater and cause the apocalypse if allowed to grow to maturity. To oppose this, a powerful order of warrior mages called Solstice Warriors was formed to exterminate the Dwellers, which are vulnerable to magic during an eclipse.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's \"HD-2D\" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is. \nRead more",

          "description": "But you know. In a good way. My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.\nI may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.\nRead more",

          "description": "I like Warframe, Digital Extremes’ shockingly enduring free-to-play action RPG, but I do find its sci-fantasy direction a bit much. The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. \nThe Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.\nRead more",

This message comes to you from that primeval epoch known as \"Last Wednesday\", when Digital Extremes treated RPS to a preview screening of the Warframe update announcements planned for this year's Tennocon - a special Tennocon indeed, coinciding as it does with the game's 10th anniversary and the studio's 30th. Alas, \"Last Wednesday\" was a regular Dark Age, and we dusty ancients were granted only a partial glimpse of the promised new areas, weapons, cosmetics and story content, Digital Extremes having reserved some of the key reveals for a happier period, \"Today\" - which, according to our most trusted seers, will be an era of understanding and transparency. Fickle are the winds of history! Still, even with the limited insight of our time, we grasped at some sense of the offering's magnitude. Read on, if you dare.\r\n\n \nRead more",

While its one-hit-kill combat was fast, flashy and infinitely more appealing than some of the other neon lambs being led to the cyberpunk slaughter in the back end of 2020, its precise platforming and marksman-grade enemies made it a hard game to love while you were actually playing it. But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here. Then there's the motorbike, which… phwoar. Let me tell you about the motorbike.\nRead more",

But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. \nOn its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing? \nRead more",

It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Sure, the dynamic mud of driving sim Spintires was impressive to look at, and it also gave us a game where driving two metres through a puddle could become a serious puzzle. So I'm certainly interested in today's announcement of Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, this time sending us off-roading to conduct science.

And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault.

It's one of those live-action affairs with CG up the wazoo, complete with an 'epic' cover of Elton John's Rocket Man that would bring a tear to the eye of Zack Snyder*, and only Zack Snyder. It does not show the game at all, nor does it capture the thrill of escaping our Earthly bonds to find a load of grey rocks just like we have at home. But you can watch the trailer below.\nRead more",

Bastion, Transistor, and Hades - all fit nicely into the action-RPG genre (as well as all being absolute bangers) but Pyre is something else entirely. Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).\nThe rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.\nRead more",

Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. \nIt's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.\nRead more",

After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.\nIndeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.\nRead more",

This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.\nDespite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.\nRead more",

          "description": "When listing off my favourite games, I'm shamefully likely to neglect to mention Firewatch. This is probably because Firewatch isn't a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.\nI think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.\nDon't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.\n Read more",

          "description": "Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. \r\n\n\r\n“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.\r\n\n\r\nThe update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.\r\n \nRead more",

The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) \"lore\", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.\nIt's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?\nRead more",

Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.\r\n\nNow it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There's a first trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "NetherRealm has shown off some spiffy-looking pictures of the classic Living Forest level as it will appear in Mortal Kombat 1. Oh, gosh. I really hate the naming scheme of these games. At least the level looks great.\nThe Living Forest first appeared in 1993’s Mortal Kombat II. It’s one of the game’s most memorable locations. Not only is it haunting and surreal, visibly demonstrating the dark hazards of Outworld, but you could also catch a glimpse of secret characters Smoke and Jade peaking from behind the haunted trees.\nSince then, it has been a staple of the series, reappearing every few games to eat a few more Kombatants. The last we saw it in its full glory was in Mortal Kombat (2011). It appears that in Mortal Kombat 1 we'll be seeing two sides of the famous flora. The first side is the normal Living Forest. During the daytime, it actually looks pretty peaceful. Full of life and foliage. No doubt, it's benefited from Liu Kang's vision of a more peaceful universe.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399606\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via NetherRealm[/caption]\nBut then there's the other side: the Corrupted Forest. There’s green fire for some reason. The trees are all skull-like. But I think the nicest touch is that the undergrowth has lost all its leaves, so you have these skeletal shrubs jutting out on all sides. NetherRealm's Twitter post seems to suggest this part of the woods has been twisted by dark magic that has interrupted the slumber of the haunted trees.\nI definitely dig the dichotomy of the slumbering Living Forest and the dangerous-looking Corrupted Forest. One looks like a nice place for a walk, and the other looks like it will wreak havoc on your shins.\nMortal Kombat 1 comes out September 19, 2023 to PC, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.\nThe post The Living Forest has gotten a facelift in Mortal Kombat 1 with two levels appeared first on Destructoid.",

This radiant version of the beefed-up Game Boy goes on sale on September 1st. There is no pre-order period, so you can expect it to ship by September 5th.\nThe Analogue Pocket is Analogue’s take on portable handhelds. It uses FPGA to create a hardware environment close to the Game Boy line of handhelds. There are also a number of adapters available that let you play games from other consoles, like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear. It also has various display modes to bring you closer to the original platforms without having to deal with all their warts.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399525\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Analogue[/caption]\nIt’s a pretty slick enthusiast-level device. I’m a bit envious since it’s sort of out of my price range. Also, I don’t really play handheld games that much, even though I’ve got a rather substantial library of titles. Still, if I had one, it would get used.\nThe glow-in-the-dark luxury edition is exactly that. The shell has been made of glow-in-the-dark plastic. It gets charged via available light sources and can apparently continuously glow for 8 hours, just like those plastic stars you have all over your bedroom ceiling. That’s all you get in terms of special features, which I feel is to be expected.\nThe Analogue Pocket Glow-in-the-Dark Limited edition will be available in “highly limited” numbers.

          "description": "Even though Starfield isn't out yet, there's been so much content and sneak previews for the game that some people are trying to piece it together ahead of schedule. For example, one person has decided to recreate an outpost styled after the upcoming sci-fi RPG in something other than Bethesda's in-house engine.\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, YouTuber Ghost Design recently uploaded footage from an Unreal Engine 5 project they've been working on. Spanning seven minutes, the footage shows what a typical Starfield outpost looks like when rendered in this software.\nhttps://youtu.be/Q67J3Aw_GEM\nUsing the free \"Mission to Minerva\" pack, Ghost Design has created what is essentially a facsimile of something that looks like it could be from Starfield itself. Only it's done in Unreal rather than Creation Engine.\nImagine the whole game in Unreal\nUE5 is currently one of (if not the) most powerful accessible game engines in the world. It's also one of the most popular, more so by the fact that any developer, big or small, can make use of it. Conversely, Bethesda's Creation Engine is proprietary, so only Bethesda games get made with it.\nWhile the use of Creation Engine for Starfield has likely drawn some criticism given how old it is, it's worth remembering that this is version 2.0. The studio has allegedly overhauled the software, bringing it more up-to-date, so games made it in should hopefully not have that Skyrim jank to them. From what we've all seen so far, it's fair to say that Starfield does look pretty. It's likely that official footage has been captured on PC using the most modern hardware around, so we'll see whether it looks as nice on a mid-range system or the Xbox Series S.\nStarfield will be releasing on September 6 for Series X|S and PC.\nThe post This is what Starfield could look like in Unreal Engine 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to the rules, entrants must be in by no later than 5PM Pacific Daylight Time on September 23, 2023. Nvidia will post winners here on October 31.\nThe prize itself\nAs you'll see in the image posted on Twitter, the RTX 4090 has an Alan Wake 2 custom backplate.

You're not winning this thing to not show it off, right?\nNvidia also recently announced DLSS 3.5 will be coming this fall. This is the next iteration of its Deep Learning Super Sampling graphical upscaling technology. Games such as Portal RTX and Cyberpunk 2077's DLC Phantom Liberty will support version 3.5, as will Alan Wake 2, which explains the current giveaway.\nThe game itself will launch on October 27, so this Nvidia promotion is nicely timed. Current previews show that the follow-up to 2010's Alan Wake is shaping up to be a good-looking horror game so far.

He appears as an ornament dangling from the ceiling of the car.\nI wanted to get that bit of trivia out of the way because it’s often all anybody knows about Rad Mobile. That is, if they even remember the name. I say that because I could never really remember it. Not until I became interested in pre-3D racing games.\nThis is mostly because Rad Mobile was only once ported to console and never in North America. That is, until it was chosen as one of the games for the Sega Astro City Mini.

However, there might be more to look forward to. The game's director, Davide Soliani, teased a return to glory for the French platforming mascot Wednesday. He also confirmed there will be a secret message if you finish the DLC with a 100% completion rate. The prospects of the first Rayman game since 2013 might come to fruition.\nAccording to fan community leader ItzalDrake from Rayman Together, Sparks of Hope director Davide Soliani sent a message to the character's fanbase just before the launch of the Phantom Show DLC:\n\"I hope that all the community and all Rayman players support us as much as possible because I'm on a mission: my mission is to be able to bring Rayman back to the glory he deserves.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RaymanTogether/status/1694386555723342118\nWhen was the last Rayman game released?\nThe limbless hero has been absent for a long time, which is strange as he was an important mascot for Ubisoft during the beginning of the studio's history. The last true game in the series was Rayman Legends, released back in 2013: a decade ago this month. If you want to go all the way back, the last 3D platforming adventure Rayman 3 came out in 2003. A fourth entry or even a follow-up to the 2D platforming subseries would be a dream for many fans of the series.\nSoliani did not outright confirm a new game in the series, but as previously mentioned, he has teased a secret hidden message for those who 100% complete the DLC. \"I hope for your support and I hope you like it!\" he concluded in his message to the fans.\nThe post Sparks of Hope director teases return to “glory” for Rayman and secret DLC message appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer Shiro Games and publisher Funcom announced plans to bring Version 1.0 to Steam in September 2023. There's also a release trailer to go along with the news. The new preview shows off more of the real-time warfare and the various means of political sabotage at your disposal.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZJPQ2dRt-8\nDune: Spice Wars originally launched in Early Access on April 26, 2022. The 4X real-time strategy game tasks players with battling for control over Arrakis. Multiple factions—including House Atreides and House Harkonnen—are available along with key characters from Frank Herbert's novel. \n[caption id=\"attachment_399159\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Shiro Games[/caption]\nTremors\nIn addition to controlling spice resources and pulling off acts of subterfuge to expand, you'll need to watch out for sandworms. Ignoring wormsign is a great way to lose your spice harvesters and troops. The number of games featuring any form of giant worm management or warning system in place is shockingly low. We'll take what we can get and consider it a bonus if a quality RTS happens to be attached. \nThe folks behind Dune: Spice Wars previously worked on Northgard, a strategy survival game based on Norse mythology. Northgard launched in 2018 and received its latest major update in April 2023. Like Northgard, players seem mostly positive on Spice Wars so far. Hopefully this sandworm will boast a similarly long post-launch tail. \nIf you're looking for more on how this one came together, the devs have been fairly active in showing off concept art and other details.\nThe post Dune: Spice Wars leaves Early Access this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

As the name implies, this will be a celebration of all things tactical. A recent promo video gives a brief hint at what's to come.\nhttps://youtu.be/xYp3ugqPxiA\nThe event will kick off Monday, August 28 at 10AM Pacific and will go on until September 4, so that's a week in which to get your strategy on (that's a saying, right?)\nWhat's to be expected?\nAs always, Steam isn't saying absolutely everything about Strategy Fest. Suffice it to say, you can find demos and discounted games on sale throughout the week. As for what's going to be on offer, it's hard to say, but the short video above outlines a few titles that are likely to be included, such as Dune: Spice Wars and The Riftbreaker. Essentially, if this is a genre you're into, you're bound to find something you like.\nConsidering that we recently had the Visual Novel Fest, and before that the Stealth Fest, Valve does a good job of making sure we all stay tuned into its gaming platform.

The studio has announced that the game has been delayed, pushing its Early Access console launch from August to October, in the week leading up to Halloween.\nhttps://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1694849069045194958?t=tRaDEz-xKbFYrOeZT2OxnQ&s=19\nAs the studio explains on Twitter, the delay is the result of a \"fire incident\" in its office building, along with \"unpredicted development issues.\" With the extra time gained by the delay, the studio hopes to perfect and fine-tune the ports.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399024\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Kinetic Games.[/caption]\nPhasmophobia lands just in time for Halloween\nThe delay isn't too long, and in the meantime, PC players can enjoy the recently released Ascension update which brings several changes, including a new leveling system with \"new rates of progression, new unlocks, and a prestige system,\" along with several minor bug fixes.\nPS5 owners will be happy to know that a PS VR2 version is also in the works, and crossplay will allow friends to play together regardless of what platform they're on. The game has already demonstrated that it is capable of providing a terrifying VR experience thanks to its VR support on PC.\nPhasmophobia's minor delay pushes it into an appropriately spooky time, which could end up being a positive for it. However, Phasmophobia will have to contend with several other headliners scheduled for October, including horror titles like Alan Wake 2 and Alone in the Dark.\nThe post Phasmophobia console launch delayed to October due to “fire incident” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced that the next game joining the Nintendo Switch Online (Expansion Pack) line-up. Excitebike 64 will be arriving on August 30.\nExcitebike 64 is generally remembered as being a better-than-expected motocross game. It was a rather strange title where, if you looked past the rather generic visuals and excess of dirt, you’d be rewarded with a lot of strangeness. This includes a soccer mini-game that the internet likes to call the original version of Rocket League and an endless desert.\nIt also got an unexpectedly awesome trailer:\nhttps://youtu.be/mVHhNyEQeio?feature=shared\nI rented Excitebike 64 back in the day and loved it. When I reunited with it years later, I couldn’t find that same spark. I pick it up every now and then, trying to remember why I loved it so much, and still can’t do it. There’s too much dirt. Too much bike. Not enough excite. Still, remember when Nintendo had its own line of sports games that didn’t involve Mario? I prefer Mario sports games over real ones, but I also love variety.\nThis is the fourth of five games Nintendo promised us for 2023. Many have been pointing out that somehow Mario Party 3 is currently the one left out. Considering the first two Mario Party games were released in 2022, it’s kind of strange that they aren’t in more of a hurry to complete the trilogy.\nIt would also be nice if they added more non-Nintendo titles. The Star Wars games, maybe? The Goemon games? Hybrid Heaven? It doesn’t really matter to me, personally, since I have an extensive N64 collection. However, there’s more to experience on the console than just Nintendo’s contributions.\nExcitebike 64 will be arriving on the Nintendo Switch Online N64 app on August 30.\nThe post Get ready for dirt bike soccer, Excitebike 64 gets added to Nintendo Switch Online on August 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Among all this Starfield talk, it's easy to forget that The Elder Scrolls 6 is even a thing (maybe). It's been five years since we were treated to a brief tease of the next installment in Bethesda's flagship series, and the face of the studio seems to regret being too hasty with things.\nIn a recent interview with GQ, Mr. Skyrim himself, Todd Howard, says he me have been a bit too quick to announce TES6, adding, \"I probably would've announced it more casually.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/OkFdqqyI8y4\nOf course, the interviewer asks whether Howard can divulge any further details about The Elder Scrolls 6. Naturally, the director isn't saying anything, though he does say that the upcoming RPG does have a codename. He also says that he and the team want the next TES game to \"fill that role of the ultimate fantasy-world simulator.\"\nSo when is it co-\nWhen's it coming out, I hear you ask? Again, nobody can really say. As a sidenote, Howard does make a comment about how he wants to keep making games, with no plans to retire any time soon. He even likens his career path to Nintendo's own Shigeru Miyamoto, who's now in his early 70s.\nIt's at this point that the GQ interviewer offers their own speculation, saying that The Elder Scrolls 6 may not be out until Todd Howard reaches 60. Given that his Wikipedia page has him down as being either 52 or 53, this means TES6 might still be a good seven or eight years off.\nObviously, that's just speculation. Although recent rumors suggest the long-awaited follow-up to Skyrim might be at least five years away. In any case, Bethesda definitely seemed to have done itself a disservice by announcing it so soon.\nThe post Todd Howard wishes he’d announced Elder Scrolls 6 ‘more casually’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. \n\n\nHere are the PC specifications for Starfield: \nMinimum: \nOS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti\nDirectX: Version 12\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nRecommended: \nOS: Windows 10/11 with updates\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nAs you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. \nStarfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. \nWhile waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. \nAre you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6?

After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance.

Join us today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. \nAshmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx\nAugust 25, 2023\n“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment,\" says Ashmore in the video. \"Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will.\"\nAlan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest.

The theme of this season is centered around heists, both of the sneaky and guns-blazing kind, and curiously, a vampire at the heart of it all. \nThat vampire is named Kado Thorne and he’s made the battle island his home in Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4. He’s draining the wealth and treasures around it to fund some new real estate (see: points of interest) around the island: Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate. \n\nEpic Games says these three locations are strongly defended bases with cameras, laser grids, and guards.

Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. \nThe game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: \n\n\n“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” \nThis sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” \n\nIf you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. \nThere’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. \nIn the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.\nAre you excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector?

First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vampire Survivors on Switch, Gunbrella, Mr. Run and Jump,  The Crew Motorfest, Ra Ra Boom, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Sea of Stars.",

The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.\nThe free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages.

It says the studio must “shift towards a more agile and a more focused studio” and is eliminating 50 roles as a result. \nAs for BioWare’s two known in-development games, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf and the next installment of Mass Effect, the studio says production on both are continuing.

However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” \nThe PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. \n\nPSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. \nPlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.",

They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. \nSimilar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals. \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.",

It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. \nCheck out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. \n“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” \n\nPearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. \nFor more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.\nAre you excited about Crimson Desert?

The combat looks reminiscent of From Software’s Sekiro and this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty from Team Ninja, but it’s clear it’s aiming for its own take on the fast-paced action combat. \nYou can check out the Black Myth: Wukong trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Black Myth: Wukong pits the player’s monkey warrior character – the Destined One – against various legends, foes, and creatures from throughout Chinese mythology, and it looks fun (and difficult). Game Science says Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on Journey to the West, one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature. “You shall set out as the Destined One to venture into the challenges and marvels ahead, to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past.” \nToday’s trailer did not reveal anything by way of a release date for the game, but it’s due out sometime in the summer of next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nWhat did you think of today’s Black Myth: Wukong trailer?

A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, \n“We've made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way.

The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. \nAtari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. \n\n\nThe 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:\nAdventure\nCombat\nDodge ‘Em\nHaunted House\nMaze Craze\nMissle Command\nRealsports Volleyball\nSurround\nVideo Pinball\nYar’s Revenge\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\nThe Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.",
