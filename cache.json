That’s right! It’s Voodoo Detective, the magical, mystical debut from Short Sleeve Studio, hot on the heels of fan-craze juggernaut Return to Monkey Island. Timing-wise, this Switch release is like arriving at a fancy dress party with a rubber glove on your head and yoghurt pot on your nose, only to meet Mel Gibson wearing the rooster suit from Chicken Run.\nHowever, having taken advantage of that particular monkey in the room for an intro paragraph, we can confess that Voodoo Detective is very much its own thing – not simply the comedy Caribbean voodoo graphic adventure a grandparent bought you by mistake. The setting is Zo Wanga Isle, an island increasingly overrun by tourists thanks to the growing commercial operations of a corrupt corporation, Island Ventures. Native Zowangians like Voodoo Detective (that’s his name – competing for silliness with his brother Donut Hole Billy) are squeezed by real estate development and profit-digging commerce, cashing in on the local climate and culture.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There are two types of karuta — Uta-Garuta, the former working with a much larger deck with the latter aimed more at children. Nintendo itself used to sell these kinds of cards as far back as 1890.

Raptor Lake will go on sale on October 20th, a few weeks after the just-launched AMD Ryzen 7000 series.\nThe showcase also included a few key details on the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition, the top-ranking graphics card in the long-delayed Arc Alchemist lineup of gaming GPUs. This will also launch next month, on October 12th, and cost $329. Honestly, part of me was wondering if we’ll ever see the day, but yes: there really will be an Intel graphics card on the market.

          "description": "It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.\nThis looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.\nAs well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.\n Read more",

          "description": "I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you'll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the 'git gud' kool-aid either. While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon. \nRead more",

Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.\r\n\n\r\nStill. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?\r\n\n \nRead more",

The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. \nAlongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans.

Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner.

          "description": "The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.\nLeague Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.\nRead more",

It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.\nIt’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.\nRead more",

CD Projekt have revealed in a tweet that the game has seen one million players every day this week so far, across all platforms. They say this figure includes players new to Night City, as well as those returning. I’ve never played it, so don’t look at me.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Have you ever played a game and thought, \"Are we actually the bad guys here?\" Usually, the whole \"we're fighting on the wrong side of history\" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. \nAround 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, \"Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.\" It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck. \nRead more",

More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.\r\n\nExcept, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected.

In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!\nWhen I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear.

Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. \r\n\n\r\nKey features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…\nRead more",

But rather going for a 512-bit FPU data path and the possibility of reduced clock frequencies and power/thermal concerns, they employed a 256-bit \"double pumping\" strategy. When getting the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in the lab, exploring the AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 performance was one of the areas I was most excited to evaluate. From the benchmarks about to be shown, AMD's initial AVX-512 implementation is promising and has me all the more excited for finding it on AMD EPYC \"Genoa\" processors.",

PlayStation Stars is rolling out for PlayStation users, starting today and spreading to more regions over the coming weeks.\nThe Stars launch kicks off in Asia first, where regions there will see the program go live on September 29. North and South America will get PlayStation Stars on October 5, while the program heads to Europe and Australia on October 13.\nIf you missed the initial announcement, PlayStation Stars is a loyalty program for owners of Sony's console. While it's free and doesn't require PlayStation Plus to enroll, Plus users will get some extra bonuses to their Stars.\nBy completing campaigns and activities, Stars users can earn rewards. Some might ask you to get a specific trophy, while another might be becoming the first player to platinum a game in their region. One of the first campaigns, dubbed \"Hit Play/1994,\" has members who correctly guess launch games based on song-based clues get a special collectible.\n\nRewards for Stars\nWhat can you use these rewards for? Well, one type of reward is loyalty points. These can be redeemed in a catalog that may include PSN wallet funds, digital collectibles, or certain PlayStation Store products. Plus members automatically accrue points for purchases on the Store, too.\nThose digital collectibles are the other reward, and don't worry. Sony VP Grace Chen told the Washington Post that these are not NFTs. As today's blog post reiterates, these cannot be sold or traded. They might be rare, but they aren't one-of-a-kind and they don't use any blockchain technology. These little collectibles will be visible on a display case within the PlayStation app, which can be viewed by other users.\nYou can get more info and make sure you're signed up when it goes live over at the PlayStation Stars page.\nThe post PlayStation lays out the launch plan for its Stars loyalty program appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II beta was a blast to play, of course, a few problems have stood out to players more than others. Specifically, players complained about imbalanced footsteps audio, as well as issues with enemy visibility.\nNo need to fret, though, because Infinity Ward has announced that they're already on the case to fix these bugs, and more, before Modern Warfare II's full launch. \"While sentiment around footstep audio was more positive i…",

And we, as humans, are afraid of so many things. Some things we’ve come up with on our own terrify us. Sometimes we’ve decided that things intended to cause joy instead cause fear. It’s great! You don’t even need something tangible, life itself is one long horrifying experience!\nThe Fridge is Red is a bit of a departure from the usual grotesque slasher horror I’ve been indulging in lately.

Emanating out of its European offices, the amusingly titled \"Bandai Namco Game Music Label\" will publish soundtracks of the studio's games in a physical and digital capacity.\n\"Since the first video games and all throughout the history of the industry, music has always been a core component of the gaming experience,\" said the studio in a press statement. \"Music made the games’ memories last longer and followed the players into their daily lives with amazing soundtracks to go back to and relive the stories they played.\"\n\"We strive to delight our fans with more than just games, so we decided to bring video game music to as many listeners as possible, with the release of two digital albums of game background music.\"\nThe first two releases from the label are the soundtrack to the smash-selling RPG Elden Ring, which launched digitally earlier this month, and Motoi Sakuraba's soundtrack to anime adventure title Tales of Arise, which launches today. Both records can be purchased via several music streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, and the iTunes Store, among others. The Bandai Namco Game Music Label intends to build upon this catalog of memorable and evocative scores.\nMost recently, French publisher Microids also announced the formation of its own record label.

A young girl, Rem, is plagued by a litany of daily troubles, all of which have suddenly chosen to manifest themselves into her dreams as unholy nightmares. Now trapped within a dungeon of her own plights and worries, Rem is forced to face each and every one of her fears, conjuring up an array of firepower and other abilities to take down the nasties.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-HMu7sdhas\nBe it violent neighborhood dogs, the mean girls from high school, trips to the surgeon, or even those horrid vegetables she has to eat at mealtimes, Rem must steel herself against her own brain spiders, conquering these demons once and for all if she is ever to escape this literal nightmare and return to the waking world. NeverAwake boasts around 80 looped levels of action, complete with an array of grotesque bosses, hand-drawn visuals, an arsenal of dynamic weaponry, and even multiple endings, all painted against relentless, blood-pumping shmup action.\nNeverAwake is available now on PC via Steam. You can also purchase the new title bundled with a digital artbook and the game's soundtrack. For console fans, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports of NeverAwake will launch in January 2023, with physical editions to follow on both platforms.\nThe post NeverAwake, a creepy-cute shmup, opens fire on PC today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, the publisher confirms that it's charting a course for Skull and Bones to launch on March 9, 2023.\nThe team attributes work being done polishing and balancing the experience ahead of its release. \"To give you the best possible experience we've decided to take a little more time to make sure we can deliver exactly that,\" the statement reads.\nKotaku, which broke the news just ahead of its official confirmation, reports that a recent Skull and Bones technical test ended on September 19. A source who was involved in the test told Kotaku that while the gameplay was \"more refined\" than previous ones, overall player progression still seemed \"shallow.\"\nUbisoft confirms it plans to host an open beta of Skull and Bones in the near future. No date's been set for that yet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYO9d3bjaLc\nA pirate's life for me\nSkull and Bones had finally locked in a firm date for this year, set for November 8.

Its studio, Ubisoft Singapore, was also the subject of reports about its internal culture, alongside broader issues reported at Ubisoft.\nWhile it's been floating around in the water for a while, the November release seemed optimistic. Skull and Bones was one of the games featured at the recent Ubisoft Forward. With a good chunk of gameplay and showcase spotlight, Skull and Bones seemed set to sail.\nUbisoft also rolled out a bunch of its plans for Assassin's Creed and more at that showcase. As for this year though, there is still Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.

Wiglett is a new Pokemon for the Paldea region.\nTeased today in a new video on the World Pokemon Ecological Society site, Wiglett joins the Paldean lineup. You can sit through the lecture online, which also shows some other regional Pokemon like Paldean Wooper, or just check out the video below via Serebii.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQoVAMGli0E\nNow, astute viewers may note that Wiglett shares some similarities with longtime Generation 1 mainstay Diglett. The burrowing Pokemon has a recognizable look, and Wiglett does indeed look a lot like Diglett. The video calls attention to this fact, too.\nAs it goes on to stress though, this Pokemon is clearly different. It's longer, for one. And it lives near water, in the sand.\n\"The form and movements indeed look like Diglett, but they are probably different Pokemon,\" the video states. So there you go.\nA new region to explore\nWe've seen a bunch of the new monsters in store for this new mainline Pokemon entry. There's the neon monkey Grafaiai, the absolute perfection of Lechonk, and the two new box art Legendary Pokemon. Those two even act as your rideable mounts for the new game, helping you travel across the land of Paldea.\nThe extra travel will help, as there's a lot to do in Scarlet and Violet. There are essentially three main storylines, with one following the usual Gym battles and others dealing with different situations in the region.\nAs for Wiglett, it's an interesting design, if a little unsettling. It looks like Diglett was rolled out like dough. Still, the little mole Pokemon was a fun one to have around in the original generation, and these goofy monsters seem fun too.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.\nThe post Wiglett is one of the new Pokemon arriving in Scarlet and Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, a new update released for all versions of the games includes a litany of tweaks and features.

The third title in the horror anthology, House of Ashes, is already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is thus unlikely to receive a similar tech upgrade.

While Haohmaru and Nakoruru are series veterans, this is only Darli's second gaming appearance, having made her debut in the ace 2019 Samurai Shodown release.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxTHBgpCMfo\nTeam Samurai will represent the fourth batch of DLC characters to join KoF XV's enormous roster since the title's initial launch earlier this year. The next season, which will kick off in 2023, has already promised to bring about the return of some KoF veterans. These include Kyo Kusanagi's well-meaning protege Shingo Yabuki, and the honorable taekwondo expert and criminal reformer Kim Kaphwan. Given Street Fighter 6's imminent launch and its wickedly redesigned Juri, it looks like it is going to be a fine year for windy, billowing taekwondo pants.\nThe King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms — Additionally, Samurai Shodown 2019 will receive a rollback netcode update next spring, which will hopefully bring about a resurgence of interest in the solid, if misunderstood, fighting title.\nThe post Team Samurai Shodown take a slash in King of Fighters XV October 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Smile.\nYesterday saw Player First Games' brawler MultiVersus receive a brand new update, bringing with it bug fixes, balance changes, the arrival of new fighter Rick Sanchez and, of course, a fresh new batch of character rumors, brought about by those crafty, crafty PC dataminers.\nMuch like with the previous update, tinkerers have been playing around with the source code of Version 1.03 of MultiVersus and have found secrets buried within. These secrets come in the form of a new \"Announcers Pack,\" that contains narration recorded by DC Comics' Clown Prince of Crime himself, Joker. This would, obviously, suggest that Gotham City's deadliest is getting set to join the MV roster somewhere down the line — This is an inevitability that will surely come as no surprise to anybody.\nYou can check out the unearthed dialogue in the tweet below, posted online by @LaisulMV.\nhttps://twitter.com/LaisulMV/status/1574811514489405440?s=20&t=ZGFG1IqOumrxd_N_YojfQA\nWhile this is unconfirmed at this time, the dialogue appears to have been recorded by Mark Hamill, who famously played Joker in the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, and is considered one of the very best portrayals of the psychopathic criminal in the canon. Splashing out on authentic voices and top-tier characters is partly responsible for MultiVersus success, giving the platform fighter a distinction above some of the other Smash Bros. clones on the market.\nPreviously, dataminers had uncovered voice lines for two more unannounced stars, The Wizard of OZ's Wicked Witch of the West, and The Ghost with The Most: Beetlejuice. To date, neither of these roster additions have been referenced in any official capacity, so these characters may be waiting in the wings for further seasons. At least sweetie-pie Harley will finally be getting a measure of revenge on ol' Mr. J.\nMultiVersus is currently in free-to-play open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post MultiVersus datamine uncovers further unannounced characters appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Today on Spot Dodge the crew discusses Nintendo’s downright unmatched game release cadence as a publisher.\nNintendo is one of the very few publishers that seem to work way ahead of schedule — the company has been known to “sit on” fully completed games until it can find an open slot to put them in its release schedule. Not only is that almost unheard of in today’s gaming economy, but most publishers are quick to release games before they’re done cooking.

          "description": "It was only a matter of time\nIn my opinion, Trombone Champ is one of the best things to happen to gaming all year. It's easy for anyone to pick up, it's well-designed, and it's laugh-out-loud goofy. I was skeptical when I heard someone say it's a Game of the Year contender, but it only took a few minutes into playing it to make me a believer. Now that the game's popularity has launched into the stratosphere, thanks to word of mouth on social media, we're starting to see the mods slowly roll in, which is exciting for someone who is very much a fan of mods.\nMods don't just include putting Trombone Champ in VR or adding custom song maps, however — it also means that players who modify their game to take custom controller inputs are back on the scene. In this case, it's my man Rudeism, a streamer known for his modified controller setups. At this point, I'm basically his full-fledged fan. This time, he hooked up a real trombone to play its virtual counterpart in the game.\nhttps://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1574760613683023879?s=20&t=rEXbyltnL1uM9nxDgm62pA\nAccording to his Twitter post, an \"ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting.\" I have no idea what any of that means, but he clearly got it working in Trombone Champ, so good on him. Rudeism also states in his post that he wishes he could play the trombone IRL, which has me wondering: did he full-on buy a trombone for this bit? Those things aren't exactly cheap, so that level of commitment is admirable, to say the least. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of an illustrious career for him as a concert trombonist.\nEither way, this real trombone Trombone Champ setup did exactly what it was supposed to — make me happy — and isn't that all we can ask for from our internet content these days? Now if anyone needs me, I'll be trying to top my high scores until someone mods K-pop songs into the game.\nThe post This guy played Trombone Champ with a trombone as a controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Drug arrest actor finally faces Judgment\nOnce Judgment hit the PC scene, it was inevitable that players would start to poke around with the title's source code, as the PC krew are wont to do — case in point, this new mod, which restores the voice and visual likeness of actor Pierre Taki, who was patched out of the RPG shortly after its initial release.\nThe controversy came about way back in the spring of 2019, when the (then) 51-year-old actor was arrested for cocaine use. While no illicit substances were found at Taki's home, the actor registered positive when tested for samples. Japan's drug laws are among some of the world's most stringent, and the event led Sega to immediately halt sales of Judgment in order to remove Taki from his role as the Tojo Clan's subsidiary captain, Kyohei Hamura. Judgment would eventually return to the market, with Hamura sporting a brand new face and a re-recorded voice.\nClearly, however, his likeness and vocal performance remained buried within the source code of the PlayStation edition, as modder Timo654 has successfully adapted a similar PlayStation mod to now work with the new PC/Steam launch. The Pierre Taki mod for Judgment can be accessed via the NexusMods website, and is compatible with the popular trainer Ryu Mod Manager, which is utilized for the modding of titles within the Ryu ga Gotoku series.\nAs for Taki himself, the Tokyo District Court handed down a sentence of 18 months in jail for cocaine use. The sentence has a three-year suspension period. The actor has continued to work in film and television since the arrest.\nJudgment PC mod restores ‘disgraced’ original Hamura actor [PCGamesN]\nThe post Judgment PC mod restores previously removed actor Pierre Taki appeared first on Destructoid.",

Having only just discovered his calling as Spider-Man, Morales is pushed to hit the ground running in order to save his community from annihilation.\nMuch like its beloved predecessor Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales was celebrated by both video game and comic-book fans for its authentic replication of the Spiderverse and its popular cast of characters. Critics praised the follow-up's slick and engaging gameplay, fluid combat, and improved range of side-missions and activities. This new port will represent the latest in an increasing catalog of PlayStation titles that are making the leap to the PC platform — a library that also includes games from popular Sony franchises including Uncharted, God of War, and Horizon Zero Dawn.\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales will launch on PC this fall.

But the caveat there is giving players all different ways that they can do that.\" They go on to comment that you could \"talk to your friends\" about beating a boss, and share that experience.\nThey also clarify that Wo Long is \"not an easy game,\" but they want to give players \"as much freedom and agency to play it as they want.\" Part of that freedom and agency is the morale system, which Yamagiwa explains: \"One thing that comes to mind is the morale system. You have a morale rank and as you keep increasing it you get stronger and you can use that to choose which enemies to fight, or raise it up so you can take on a harder enemy and maybe they’ll be a little bit easier now that you’re stronger.\" That system was actually present in the demo, and while it's confusing at first, it's another tool in the tool kit in terms of squaring up opponents. Think of it like a micro-leveling system, where you (or your enemies) can raise your power level.\nIn any case, the \"single difficulty setting\" conversation is bound to have a lot of different takes, but at least we know where Wo Long stands either way. Given Team Ninja's recent takes on action adventure romps, this isn't a surprise.\nThe post Wo Long will have one difficulty setting, says producer appeared first on Destructoid.",

More options are shown in the trailer, including a menu full of toggles like resolution render and FPS limits, as well TAA upsample and more.\nParticularly cool is the option to support ultrawide and multi-monitor PC setups for Gotham Knight. You know, so you can play the new Bat game on a Batcave-style computer layout.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REicHG5ZR3U\nBasically, there are a bunch of tools and toggles for making the Bat-family's fight for Gotham look really pretty.\nThe fight for Gotham\nGotham Knights is the new title from WB Games Montreal. Rather than following Batman like other Arkham-style games, though, this one sees the associated Bat-crew taking up his mantle after Bruce's untimely departure.\nBatgirl, Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood are all playable, and the story looks set to focus in on the mysterious Court of Owls. Still, today's trailer is a reminder that we won't just be seeing owl masks all the time; other villains like Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn will also be showing up to cause some chaos.\nThe added PC options are nice to see, especially as Gotham Knights is focusing on the current generation of console hardware.

          "description": "Wouldn't you love to escape?\nEmber Labs' beautiful and ethereal adventure title Kena: Bridge of Spirits is now available to purchase on the Steam platform, following on from its 2021 release on PlayStation and one-year exclusivity deal with Epic Games Store. This anniversary re-release also brings with it some fun new bonus items.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axkJPUVpjWU\nKena: Bridge of Spirits is something of a mood piece, following the zen-like adventure of the titular young spirit guide as she embarks upon a journey to guide the recently departed from the plains of reality to their eternal resting place in the spirit realm. While the title does feature world traversal, puzzle-solving, and combat elements, it must be noted that the adventure is more a trek to be enjoyed than a challenge to overcome. In any regard, Kena is a very attractive and charismatic venture, and deserving of the plaudits directed toward its visuals, audio, and satisfying mechanics.\nIn addition to the Steam launch, a new \"Anniversary Update\" is available to download for free on all platforms. The package adds a New Game+ feature, Spirit Guide trials, new Charmstones, and various accessories and outfits for our lovely protagonist. Deluxe Edition owners will get an exclusive bonus outfit. If you're yet to pick up Kena, and are intrigued by this release, then note that the Steam release is currently available to purchase at a discounted price for the first week of sale, so move fast!\nKena: Bridge of Spirits is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.\nThe post Kena: Bridge of Spirits brings charming mysticism and new features to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

This motion severely affects the current development plans for People Can Fly's \"Project Dagger\", a title that has been in production at the developer's New York studio for the past two years.\nThe news was revealed in People Can Fly's latest financial update, where it is stated that Take-Two, the publisher behind such behemoths as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, had essentially pulled out of the project entirely, leaving Project Dagger with a developer, but no publisher to handle its eventual marketing and release. Take-Two seemingly chose not to purchase the rights to the project, which will be retained by the studio.\nAddressing the turbulent situation, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski says that he \"assumes\" the two companies will part on good terms, and expresses the studio's desire to continue development on the title, with an eye to finding a new publisher, or perhaps even self-publishing. Project Dagger, which remains under wraps, had been described previously as a \"groundbreaking adventure game\", and is currently in the process of transitioning from Unreal 4 to the dazzling new tech of Unreal 5.\n\"We strongly believe in the Project Dagger's potential and are now committed to continue its development within our self-publishing pipeline,\" confirms Wojciechowski. \"The game is still in pre-production – our team is now focusing on closing combat and game loops and migrate from UE4 to UE5. I'm conscious that this decision will add investments on us, but self-publishing is part of our strategy.\"\n\"Of course, we are not ruling out working with a new publisher if this creates a compelling business opportunity.\"\nThe post Take-Two ends co-operation with People Can Fly two years into Project Dagger development appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. \nIt was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.\nKotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. \nHere's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: \nThe last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. \nAre you excited to play Skull and Bones next March?

          "description": "At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. \nThe teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. \n\n\nThe Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.\nTo help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1.

          "description": "In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.\nE3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. \nThe ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. \nJune 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   \nAs previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a \"world class event to serve the global gaming industry.\" The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.",

However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. \nThe publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. \nWhile waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you want out of a new Silent Hill game?

Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake.

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8.
