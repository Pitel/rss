Yep, it really has been seven years since we saw the Switch, and we're starting to feel very old now.\nGeoff Keighley, host of Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards, shared a tweet today reminiscing about the streamed event, which showcased the hybrid console's technical details, price, and launch date. It's kind of amazing, thinking back, that the Switch was properly shown off just under two months before it launched. That never happens.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We already know to expect some story-based DLC as it was a stretch goal for the game when it was on Kickstarter, but now we know it's officially in development.\nDeveloper Sabotage Studio shared a tweet earlier today, updating fans on the current plans for the studio. Back in November 2023, the team got together for \"Sabobo Summit\", an event where Sabotage seemingly gets together and shares ideas.

          "description": "Not starring Joe Musashi.\nShinorubi feels like a game that came about by providing prompts to an AI specialising in video game building (coming soon, no doubt), feeding it information on various historical works of a particular nature, and then publishing whatever it spat out. That might sound mean to the humans that created it, but it’s an apt descriptor nonetheless.\nShinorubi has the odd misfortune of getting worse depending on the size of your screen. On our 55” panel, the experience was somewhat shocking. Filling the full 16:9 aspect and played in a vertical format, the player ships are enormous, with a giant pink jewel on their nose to dictate the hit-box area. Each pilot has different shot types, underpinned by a straightforward shot, laser, and bomb setup, as well as a fever power-up mode that’s triggered by collecting stars. It appears Shinorubi runs at 30fps, but on a large flatscreen is so janky it's hard to say. Every ship in the game, with their various pros and cons, travel at extreme speeds to cover the play area, requiring inappropriate firing of the laser just to quell the weird skating of their movement. The larger the screen, the more prone you are to accidentally crash into bullets, not helped by laggy controls, and everything seems to stutter slightly. When you die in docked mode, it’s not because the game is overly difficult, but because you’re struggling to understand the action.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The original Fresh Prince returns.\nWay back in 1989, Jordan Mechner's original Prince of Persia represented one of the first and best examples of what's become known as the 'cinematic platformer'. It's a traditionally challenging genre, one that combines strong art, fun storylines, and fluidly animated protagonists to bring us adventures that test reflexes and puzzling abilities to their limits. You know the sort of thing, stuff like Flashback and Another World; y'know, the classics.\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown is the latest rebirth of sorts for the franchise — following on from The Sands of Time and 2008's Prince of Persia revamp — one that takes the established lore of past entries and ditches them in favour of a tangentially-related new lead character, and a bit of role-switching fun. Yes, this brand-new tale sees you play as Sargon, a member of The Immortals (crime-fighting hero types), and a man who meets all the criteria required of a bonafide action hero.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's only natural that so-called leaks and whispers will increase rapidly as we inch to an inevitable official announcement from Nintendo, whenever that will be. It can be tough to determine what's legitimate and what's not, and for every story we run here on NL concerning credible hardware rumours, there are five others we sidestep due to chronic eye-roll and big hmm.\nA recent report from a Taiwanese Economic Forum (via Reddit) has suggested that the Switch 2 will come boasting a 120hz screen, NVIDIA’s T239 processor, and improved battery life. On the flip side, it also states that the console's RAM will be limited to 8GB, while the internal storage will only be a meagre 64GB.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Readers, I have good news and bad news. Good news. My mum got me an incredible hot chocolate maker for Christmas this year, as well as a jumbo-sized box of grated chocolate sachets to use with it. It is, quite honestly, one of the best presents she's ever given me, and it now means I can have perfect hot chocolate, practically on tap, in as little as three minutes. Hotel Chocolat's Velvetiser, you're an absolute beauty. Honestly, it is so much better than anything I could make, or have made, myself. It's fast, easy, wonderfully smooth and properly delicious hot chocolate. Crucially, the machine itself is also dead simple to clean. Gone are the days I have to worry about washing up a pan of semi-encrusted milk afterwards, or faffing about with how many teaspoons of hot chocolate powder to plonk in because I accidentally coughed and sent half of it flying all over the counter.\nBad news. This recent revelation of such effortless, technological ease has instantly kneecapped any excitement or desire I might have had for Kitfox Games' new tea brewing sim they announced at the tail end of last year, or indeed any other kind of drink-based simulation game (of which there seem to be an increasing number of these days). Whereas before I might have revelled in the step-by-step process of making a perfect hot drink, I have now been fully converted to the ways of instant button pressing and time-saving efficiency. After all, why dwell on the manual minutiae when machinery is king?\nRead more",

          "description": "CES 2024 is drawing to a close, and honestly, I’m not especially sad to see it go. While the Las Vegas tech megashow is probably the closest thing PC gaming hardware has to an E3 (and in some ways surpasses it, given CES still exists), this year’s event has been characterised by an all-too-credulous obsession with AI nonsense. Not the fun/useful DLSS kind that makes your games run faster – more the kind that replaces actual creative work with dubiously-sourced robot media. Icky stuff, even by Vegas standards.\nMercifully, not everyone was there to flog Stable Diffusion boxes and imaginary ChatGPT friends, so there is actually some interesting new kit to look forward to in 2024. I’ve rounded up the highlights here, along with some of the more questionable AI-based showings – because they may well merit discussion, even if that discussion amounts to \"Is this a good idea?\" followed by \"No.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "It took all of one turn before the insults started flying in our Solium Infernum multiplayer preview session this week. Specifically, they'd been launched straight into the court of League Of Geeks co-founder and studio director Trent Kusters, who was attempting to show us how the game's asynchronous multiplayer mode worked in a six-player match-up - the public playtest for which goes live today, Thursday January 11th, over on Steam. Moments earlier, he'd been walking myself, deputy editor Alice Bee and guides editor Ollie through the basics of this strategy game from hell, telling us about the importance of claiming territory, seeking out places of power to bolster our domain, and how to do battle with our hive-like legion units. But just as we were watching our individual turn orders play out, Kusters announced that Ollie had given him the digital equivalent of a demonic slap in the face, demanding he pay tribute to him, or else…\nTo his credit, Kusters took it with good humour. \"This is the beautiful thing about this game - it's petty high school politics in Hell,\" he said laughing before graciously deciding to accept the insult at the cost of some of his prestige - the all-important hallmark of how you're perceived within this conclave of warring demons fighting for Satan's empty throne. Personally, I think Ollie's insult would have pierced my exceedingly thin skin instantly if I'd been in the same position, and I'd probably have been torn between declaring a vendetta against Ollie's unjustified affront, or challenging him to a Praetor duel to exact some (hopefully) righteous vengeance. Alas, since we were literally only a turn into this game, none of us were in any position to make good on those options, leaving the only possible outcome as eating it and moving on. It was a smart move on Ollie's part, and one that makes me both terrified and excited to see how our own team multiplayer sessions will play out in the run-up to Solium Infernum's full release on February 14th.\nRead more",

It conjures up images of forgotten pasts being rediscovered, of wrongs being righted, and power being restored to its rightful balance. They're all promises that Ubisoft Montpellier capably deliver on over the course of its neatly plotted story, and often in more ways than one. But after flinging its hero warrior Sargon around the monster-filled streets of its Mount Qaf citadel for the better part of 20 hours, I'd also like to proffer the following alternatives: Pit Of A Thousand Spikes; The Eternal Death Wheels Of Spinning Blades; or maybe just simply Traps: The Game. These are perhaps more accurate descriptions of the challenges you'll face in The Lost Crown, as Mount Qaf is not a place you're allowed to tread lightly. Death stalks every corner, but that's precisely what makes this dextrously designed Metroid-like such a thrilling platformer. Put away your prejudices, because this is easily the equal of both Moon Studios' pair of Ori games, Hollow Knight and its Metroid genre namesakes.\nRead more",

Yes, I gave the game a Bestest Best badge that I stand by, but I also think it's one of FromSoftware's most taxing soulslike creations. It's so colossal that, by the end of my adventure, I'd had enough of the umpteenth boss. I wanted rid.\nWith talk of Elden Ring's Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC spinning up as 2024 begins, I've assessed my feelings and come to the conclusion that I'm not as excited as I would've been had the game and its DLC somehow existed a few years ago. To be honest with you, part of me hopes it just ends up being a roguelike. That way I might actually get into it.\nRead more",

It was a fizzing neon labyrinth that was both home to various evil snakes and sort of made of snakes in probably-Freudian ways.\nFortunately, I had a lucid dreaming strategy for escaping from Snake World: relax all my limbs as much as I could, then flail around violently to wake myself up. It doesn't look like this will be an effective gambit in Digested, a bodycam horror game about being stuck on a barren, thinly forested and possibly irradiated island with a giant snake.

One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. \r\n\n\r\nWarp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Remedy's Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive's Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game's villainous Entity.\nMind you, I'm a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight's universe, not Behaviour Interactive. \"As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back,\" it reads. \"Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped.

You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.\nSurface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise.

One act isn't the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur's Gate 3, which many players feel isn't a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG's first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act's \"drastic\" tone shift better in future releases.

          "description": "It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.\nWhat best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon's secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.\nRead more",

New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.\nYou'll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times.

Not only do you have to find the perfect SFF case, but then you have to spec out all of the components to fit inside it - and miniaturised motherboards in particular often come at a premium, especially if you're building a current-gen system. \nThankfully, right now Amazon UK is doing a great deal on ASRock's best Mini ITX motherboard for Ryzen 7000 CPUs, with a £146 asking price that comes 20% below its £187 RRP and more than £20 cheaper than the next-closest UK retailer. \nRead more",

          "description": "Even with the rising power of integrated graphics, the prospects of getting high-quality, high-rez gaming capability in a laptop of ultrabook proportions is still years from becoming a feasible reality. Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.\nThe usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.\nRead more",

I still haven't played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur's Gate 3 or Assassin's Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn't anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I'd finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. \nWhat did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of 'em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn't even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I'm pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I'm allergic to anything over four hours - and I don't like it.\nRead more",

Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there's never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.\nRead more",

It's a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I'll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year's resolutions. Traditionally, I don't often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I'm aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more 'nice to haves' rather than 'musts', I'd say. \nThis year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you've also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco. \nRead more",

Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.\nSince then, we've listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It's all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning.

That's the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima's latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There's a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn't outright necessary to prevail.\nI doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it's an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.\nRead more",

The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games. \r\n \nRead more",

A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people's teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That's Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.\nRead more",

The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official \"big'uns\" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.  \nRead more",

I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.\nThe first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version.

          "description": "You could say that Alan Wake 2 was decades in the making. Last year’s blockbuster from Remedy saw the studio return to its roots and the horrors therein, dredging up the past to loop into something new, now. But it wasn’t just the main character or gameplay style we saw return, but the sounds and inspirations of the original Alan Wake too, bubbling up from Cauldron Lake through the music of Poe.\n\n\nWhen I was playing Alan Wake 2, I was pleasantly surprised—maybe even a bit shocked—to hear a song that sounded like Poe between chapters. And a quick search later, I had verified as much: singer-songwriter Poe had collaborated with Remedy’s Sam Lake to record a new song, “This Road,” just for Alan Wake 2.\n\n\nFor fans of meta-textual works, this was an incredible piece of news. It felt like severa…",

          "description": "8BitLegit has announced that Dead Tomb, a new NES game based on an old lost game, is soon to be released for Switch, Xbox, and the actual NES.\n\n\nWhile Dead Tomb is a new NES game built from the ground up, it’s actually based on a game called Temporal Inc., which was a game for the Videoway, a very unique subscription-based content delivery system based out of Quebec, Canada. Among its features was the ability to play 8-bit games, which would be loaded into the system’s RAM, which, obviously, emptied once you were done.\n\n\nBecause no one actually owned the games that they were playing, and the service eventually shut down, there are no known copies of Temporal Inc. remaining. However, there was a recorded playthrough of the entire game, so fans were able to reverse-engineer and recreate it, first as a flash game and now as the NES remake, Dead Tomb. If you want more than a quick summation, Hardcore Gaming 101 has a fantastic write-up that covers everything in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a pretty cool story, and it looks like a pretty cool game. It has you stranded in ancient Egypt, trying to escape from a pyramid. Its verb-based adventure style harkens back to the glory days of the LucasArts SCUMM Engine. It’s been developed by homebrew veterans Collectorvision (which owns the Acclaim brand).\n\n\nDead Tomb is coming to Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and NES. It will be available for preorder on all platforms on January 19, 2024. The modern console version will be released on January 26. The NES version is scheduled to ship in Q3 2024 but is limited to 300 copies.\n\nThe post Dead Tomb is a verb-driven NES adventure based on a lost game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not knowing about a game that was just reissued? I actually do know Märchen Veil because of the Famicom Disk System version released in 1987.

          "description": "After targeting iOS and Android devices in November, Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal has a new console on the hit list. The upgraded version of the 2006 stealth classic is coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop on January 25. \n\n\nLike the iOS and Android versions, the Switch iteration will see vast improvements over the initial title that launched on PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 in 2006. Some of which you may notice in the Switch release date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive handled the iOS and Android ports of Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal, and they're taking care of the Switch version as well. The game's visuals haven't changed much since 2006, but there are a lot of quality-of-life features being introduced to make Agent 47 feel a bit more modern. \n\n\nInstinct Mode, something that was introduced to the Hitman series later on, is incorporated into Reprisal. It helps players out by highlighting important mission objectives and targets on the level's map so you have a clearer idea of what you're being tasked with and where you should be headed.\n\n\n2006's Blood Money didn't have a mini-map for players to utilize, but Feral Interactive implemented one to aid moment-to-moment gameplay in Reprisal. It's dynamic too, showing instant feedback for Agent 47 as NPCs grow suspicious of his actions. \n\n\nThe controls have been reworked too since the initial PlayStation 2 and Xbox/Xbox 360 releases of Blood Money. This will surely make playing through the stealth title's 12 replayable sandbox missions much smoother on Nintendo's hybrid console. \n\n\nWhile the iOS and Android versions of the game launched at $19.99, the Switch iteration of Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal is being listed at $29.99 on the Nintendo eShop. But those who head over there and preorder before the game's January 25 release will earn themselves a 16% discount, knocking the overall cost down to $24.99.\n\nThe post Hitman: Blood Money – Reprisal sneaks onto Switch January 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Discord is probably one of the most popular chat services in the world, but even this monolithic communication tool is not immune to the dreaded \"L\" word. It turns out it, too, is about to lay a chunk of its workforce off.\n\n\nAccording to a report from The Verge, Discord has announced it will be letting 17% of its staff go – the equivalent of 170 people – across numerous departments.\n\n\nImage via CNBC.\n\n\nCompany CEO Jason Citron has said the layoffs are an effort to help \"sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.\" It's up to you to decide whether that means anything or not.\n\n\nQuick growth is to blame\n\n\nThe unfortunate impact is allegedly the result of a fast-expanding workforce, \"increasing 5x since 2020,\" Citron goes on to say. He then adds that, as a result, \"we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated.\"\n\n\nThis comes hot off the heels of Twitch saying it was letting 35% of its staff go and, just before that, Unity also announcing significant job cutbacks. I've said this in a previous post, but this really doesn't bode well for the gaming industry for 2024.\n\n\nDiscord has around 196 million monthly users, according to one source, and is often a go-to for gamers. It's such a shame that a sizeable portion of the company is being let go, especially after all the grim news about layoffs we saw in 2023.\n\nThe post Discord is the latest tech company to initiate layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The fact that it’s won so many awards should clue me into just how much of a gaming phenomenon it is. However, what I am really into is The Elder Scrolls series, and a recent mod is making my ears prick up.\n\n\nOver on Nexus Mods, user Ghouls0Rules has made it possible to play Baldur's Gate 3 as a Dunmer, the dark elf race from such hits as Morrowind and Skyrim. While it has a \"heavy focus on visuals,\" it goes beyond a simple skin and texture swap.\n\n\nImage via Ghouls0Rules/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nIt also comes with additional features. The download page says it has \"unique passives and spells,\" as well as \"some level progression for each subrace.\" So this is more than just about looking like a TES character, as it has function too. You can get the mod from here. It actually came out in December, but I was too busy with Christmas and not playing BG3 to spot it at the time.\n\n\nFeels like it fits, thematically\n\n\nGaming definitely had its ups and downs across the whole of 2023. While the industry experienced a lot of job losses and studio closures, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 was definitely a high point.\n\n\nIt's currently flying high on the Steam top-sellers list, albeit it's now been pushed down one spot by Counter-Strike 2. Given the RPG's prestige, it's likely to be riding this success wave for some time. The fact that it's the ninth most played game in terms of peak concurrent players – according to SteamDB – should tell you everything.\n\n\nAnd yet, I still need to get in on it. I don't really have any excuse, and as a long-time fan of The Elder Scrolls games, I have even less of one, thanks to this mod.\n\nThe post This Baldur’s Gate 3 mod lets you play as a Dunmer from The Elder Scrolls appeared first on Destructoid.",

This may be remedied by a new version of the controller that has appeared online, as Resetera user ezidro3 noticed. \n\n\nThe new controller, dubbed the \"PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller - White\" was originally spotted on Best Buy Canada, along with an included charging station and $89.99CAD price tag, but the post has been taken down since. The new controller looks identical to its predecessor, except this one is supposed to feature 12 hours of gameplay on a full charge. The page has since been taken down, with no official word from Sony yet regarding this new device. \n\n\nThe DualSense is a phenomenal controller with features that make it a near-irresistable inclusion to any gaming arsenal. However, the low battery has always been a problem, providing 4-6 hours of wireless gameplay depending on which features are being used. Grab the Dualsense Edge, and you can expect even less time.\n\n\nIf there's one new piece of hardware Sony wanted to add to please fans, this is probably it. Only a white version has been seen, but if it's available in other colors, Sony may have found a way to slip its fingers into my wallet. \n\n\nNow where is the DualSense Edge in different colors?\n\nThe post Mysterious PS5 DualSense V2 with more battery life appears online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced that Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service on January 17.\n\n\nBack in the Game Boy Advance days, I was so into Golden Sun. It was released in 2001 – the same year that the Game Boy Advance was launched. I was still getting used to having such a powerful (for the time) handheld, and Golden Sun just felt like a massive production with some really impressive-looking graphics. I remember listening to the theme repeatedly with headphones in, just soaking in the grandeur.\n\n\nI enjoyed The Lost Age even better, as you can use a password to carry over your progress from the first game. It’s a direct continuation of the narrative, but the whole game is just so much more massive and impressive. Not knowing what I was getting into at the time, I got absolutely sucked in. Much of the game is just a blur to me now, which implies to me that I completed it in a very short period of time.\n\n\nI never really played the third game on the DS, though.\n\n\n\n\nSince then, I haven’t had the gumption to play through the first game again. The introduction to that game is just so painfully long. It takes quite some time before you’re really let off the leash to do anything of substance. I know it gets better as it proceeds, but I just haven’t been able to get over that initial climb.\n\n\nWill I finally be able to play through it again now that it's on Switch? I’m not sure. I’d like to, but there’s so much precedent for me to give up early on. Maybe I’ll at least try.\n\n\nGolden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age will be added to the Game Boy Advance service of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack on January 17.\n\nThe post The GBA Golden Sun duology gets added to Nintendo Switch Online on January 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari has announced the next in the line of Retro Games’ mini PC consoles, the Atari 400 Mini, based on the classic Atari home computer. It will be available starting March 28.\n\n\nFor younger readers, before IBM and Microsoft devastated the proprietary home computer market with the introduction of DOS, computers were often their own platform. There was the Commodore line, the Sinclairs, the Apples, and, of course, Atari. The Atari 400 and 800 were first introduced in 1979 and gave birth to the Atari 8-bit line.\n\n\n\n\nRetro Games previously released The C64 Mini, the A500 Mini (Amiga), and The Vic20, based on the Commodore lineup of home computers.\n\n\nThe Atari 400 Mini comes with 25 preinstalled games, including M.U.L.E. and Millipede and the store page says you can load and play programs “you already own.” It comes with a USB controller styled off the Atari CX40, displays at 720p, and is powered by USB (no included adapter). It is also compatible with other USB controllers.\n\n\nI feel like mini emulation boxes are a good fit for old computers. Unless you’re an enthusiast, you probably have no interest in owning the actual hardware for, say, spreadsheets. Therefore, you don’t really need the keyboard, which was rarely ever used to play games. As for me, I own an Atari 600XL and an Atari XEGS, so I’m probably passing on this. On the other hand, games for them are kind of hard to come by and often expensive.\n\n\nCurrently, the Atari 400 Mini is only announced in the UK where it releases on March 28. No plans have been announced for North America.\n\nThe post Beige is back with the Atari 400 Mini appeared first on Destructoid.",

And the little slice of music that's been shared, in 16-bit form, certainly sets the tone.\n\n\nAtlus has shared a roughly four-minute preview of selections from the 16-bit arranged music album for the upcoming Unicorn Overlord. Per the description, this album takes the music of Unicorn Overlord and rearranges it into 16-bit form for the game's Monarch Edition (a.k.a. collector's edition).\n\n\nWho better, then, to remix some tactics nostalgia than Basiscape? The studio worked with Vanillaware on 2020's excellent 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, and it's founded by Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.

According to Gematsu, publisher Cygames and developer Cygames Osaka announced that a demo will be coming to both platforms tomorrow, January 12. In areas where it is already January 12, like New Zealand, the demo is available now.\n\n\nImage via Cygames\n\n\n3 Modes and a launch version reward\n\n\nThe demo will feature three different modes: Tutorial, Story, and Quest modes. In tutorial mode, players will be able to practice the basic controls of the game to get comfortable with Granblue Fantasy: Relink's ARPG combat system. Story mode will feature a brief section from the introduction part of Relink, showcasing a bit of the story. Last is Quest Mode, which includes three different quests. The quests are multiplayer-compatible allowing players to team up with 1-3 friends or AI-controlled allies in more challenging battles.\n\n\nAlongside the three modes, the demo will also feature the ability to customize gear load-outs across 11 different playable characters.\n\n\nThose who complete the Story and Quest modes of the demo will get some small bonuses in the release version at launch. It's always great when a demo adds some sort of bonus for playing it or even a save that carries over. It makes me much more interested in giving it a whirl when I know there's something to gain from doing so or that I won't have to do everything again.\n\n\nGranblue Fantasy: Relink launches on January 31, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\n\nThe post Granblue Fantasy: Relink gets a PlayStation demo ahead of launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's so much potential to draw from between those entries, yet regardless, the series floundered. The last entry in the series, The Forgotten Sands, didn't exactly light the world on fire.

          "description": "It's a shame Arkane Studios' Ravenholm was cancelled. That would have definitely filled the large Half-Life hole us fans have felt for some time. However, a modding team has been on the case with a custom story that lets us experience the creepy mining town some more.\n\n\nFrom the people that brought us the Raising the Bar project – an overhaul of Half-Life 2 that breathes new life into the iconic FPS – comes Raising the Bar: Salvation. In this mod, we fill the shoes of Father Grigori, the pastor of Ravenholm who watches over Gordon Freeman in the official game, as he continues his story.\n\n\n\n\nWe get to trek back through the abandoned location, in which the devout man intends to burn the entire place down. You can download the mod here. The above video says you'll also need to install the Division 2.1 file from the Raising the Bar: Redux mod in order for Salvation to work.\n\n\nThe holiest shotgun-wielder around\n\n\nWhat makes this slightly intriguing is its approach to combat. The team has said that resources are a bit more scarce, and players will only have a limited amount of supplies. With just a shotgun, custom mines, and a Duke Nukem-style kick, it becomes more about picking one's battles.\n\n\nFather Grigori was definitely one of the most interesting characters in Half-Life 2. While only in the one section of the game, and not always visible on-screen, his presence is often felt by the player, as gunfire and manic laughs are heard in the distance.\n\n\nHe's part of what makes the Ravenholm chapter such a standout. While we may never know what happens to Gordon Freeman in any future Half-Life installments, Salvation at least fills in some of the side narrative. And isn't that just as important?\n\nThe post Salvation is a Half-Life 2 mod that puts you in the shoes of Father Grigori appeared first on Destructoid.",

PC Cursed 98 will give you the whole experience you’ve been looking for, it's free, and it’s available for PC now.\n\n\nPC Cursed 98 is a compilation of short indie games in the framework of the sort of demo disc that came with magazines in the '90s and '00s. This makes it adjacent to Haunted PS1 and its variety of PS1-styled cursed demo discs. What makes PC Cursed 98 a bit different is that it comes packed with an actual magazine. I’m not even talking about a short pamphlet, either. It’s 52 pages of articles and twisted advertisements. That’s commitment. It’s even set up in such a way that you can have it professionally printed out. On top of that, there are even covers for a CD case for the demo disc.\n\n\n\n\nThe (free) demo disc contains 21-ish shortform horror games from a slew of creators. From the list, I only really recognize Jacob Jazz, who made the Baobabs Mausoleum games. But that’s kind of the point of these compilations: you get a glimpse into the minds of a variety of small, indie developers. Maybe you’ll like what you see and will form a brand-new parasocial relationship with them!\n\n\nThe games are supposedly all horror-themed, but their style runs the gamut between lo-fi, jank pop, and retro-inspired. Typically, for these jams, a lot of the included games are very experimental. As such, some of them fail. Others might make you wish you could unsee them. But a few may echo in the darkest recesses of your soul. It’s worth a look. Jam games, I guess you could call them.\n\n\nPC Cursed 98 is now available for PC through itch.io.

The chip firm entered the GPU arena back in 2022, and now it's a little closer to completing the next iteration of its Arc brand.\n\n\nIn an interview with PC World (as spotted by PC Gamer) at CES 2024, Intel Fellow Tom Petersen said that Arc Battlemage (the follow-up to Alchemist) \"is coming.\" Around 30% of engineers are working on the GPU right now, \"mostly on the software side.\" Ideally, this all wraps up before CES in January 2025.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of this, the hardware portion of the team is now moving onto Celestial, the next graphics card from Intel. Petersen says Battlemage has \"already had its first silicon in the lab,\" and \"more good news is coming.\"\n\n\nA story arc that perhaps needs to pick up\n\n\nAs for when we can expect the next line of Arc GPUs, Petersen is unable – or unwilling – to go into details, but is hopeful we may get to see something at next year's CES event. That's not a given, but it might give some indication of perhaps when it could be released. That's all just pure speculation, for now.\n\n\nIntel doesn't seem to have quite found its feet in the dedicated graphics card industry. With Nvidia and AMD flexing every muscle they have, Team Blue seems to be trailing behind. This could be because the Alchemist experienced delays, but it could be because the other two have just been in the game for much longer.\n\n\nHowever, the upcoming Claw device from MSI is being powered by Intel hardware, including an Arch chip, so that's something. This time next year, things might be different, but it sounds like progress on Battlemage is coming along.\n\nThe post Intel’s Battlemage GPU could be coming this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, not quite, as developer CD Projekt Red is now turning its attention to the follow-up, with the game's narrative director eager to get started.\n\n\nAccording to a recent Twitter post from CDPR's own Igor Sarzyński, Cyberpunk 2077 was \"just a warm-up,\" and the studio is now preparing to \"officially kick-start our Orion journey.\" Orion is the working title for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.\n\n\n\n\nThe team working on the next entry began its first day in the new Boston office earlier this week. Sarzyński has said they're \"excited for this project,\" while one person (who weirdly dubs themselves Abraham Lincoln on Twitter) asks whether they've been practicing their Boston access. Sarzyński replies: \"I'm trying!\"\n\n\nImagine Cyberpunk and Good Will Hunting in one\n\n\nTowards the end of last year, CD Projekt Red unleashed one last big update for Cyberpunk 2077. For real, this time. The developer is now seemingly leaping into 2024 with hopes for the future.\n\n\nWe don't really know anything about the upcoming game, but it's fair to say the studio will have learned some much-needed lessons from when the current game dropped like a hot mess back at the tail end of 2020.\n\n\nThings have certainly improved since then – to the point where it was one of the top-grossing Steam releases of 2023 – but it's a memory that burns deep for some. As CDPR begins to make progress on the follow-up, we can only hope Sarzyński and the rest of the team knock this one out of the park the first time around.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 was ‘just a warm-up’ CDPR says, as work begins on sequel appeared first on Destructoid.",

Those who opt for all the bonuses will get the game along with a keychain, reversible cover, and a CD containing Machinae Supremacy's original soundtrack. Like the standard versions, the Deluxe Editions of both games are priced at €39.99, but these are exclusively up for pre-order at the Red Art Games website. \n\n\nHere's a look at both games in action:\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, it sounds like Shmup Week has some more surprises waiting in the wings.

          "description": "Amper Software, the team behind Team Fortress: Source 2, and James Lambert, the dev working on Portal 64, have stated that they’re ending development of their fan projects following cease and desist demands from Valve.\n\n\nTeam Fortress: Source 2 was a fan project aiming to port Valve’s 2007 multiplayer shooter, Team Fortress 2, over to the newer Source 2 engine. While the team had paused development in September, they were hoping to resume at some point, but the DMCA has made that pause permanent.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Portal 64 is a project intended to demake 2007’s Portal to run on the Nintendo 64 hardware. Just a few days ago, the developer was celebrating the release of the game’s “First Slice,” which demonstrated the game's progress.\n\n\nThe Team Fortress: Source 2 takedown seems rather understandable since Valve still supports Team Fortress 2 and may one day want to port it or create a sequel themselves. The DMCA posted on the public GitHub page cites that their reasons are due to Valve’s own assets being used in a project, though that hasn’t stopped some other fan games based on their properties from being published and even sold on Steam.\n\n\nMeanwhile, James Lambert says that Valve has stated that they’ve requested Portal 64 to be taken down because “the project depends on Nintendo’s proprietary libraries.”\n\n\nThis is somewhat surprising since Valve has long supported fan endeavors based on their games, going as far as allowing them to be sold as retail products on Steam. Either this demonstrates a shift in the company’s policy toward such projects, or they actually have reasonable concerns toward these particular projects. Either way, it’s not a great look directly after their announced shift on their storefront policies in regards to AI.\n\nThe post Portal 64 and Team Fortress: Source 2 fan projects shut down after Valve DMCA appeared first on Destructoid.",

Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard,\" a press release reads. \"Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks.\" \nIn the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. \nBoth games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you'd like, but both must have access to the games. \n\nGolden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. \nIf you're curious about that library, here's every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription. \nAre you going to check out the Golden Sun games next week?

          "description": "There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.\nBack in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed \"AI Shark,\" it's now a software-agnostic program designed to provide \"personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming.\" What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It's all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. \n\"The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024.\"\nTo be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console's release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo's response, assuming it issues one.\nFor more Nintendo Switch, check out our episode of All Things Nintendo where we list our most anticipated Switch games, and then read up on how Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown runs on the console.\n\n\n\n[Source: Digital Trends]",

Now, the subscription streaming service has released the official trailer for Season 2 of Halo: The Series and it promises the fall of Reach, plenty of Covenant and Energy Swords, and more of Master Chief without his helmet on for some reason. \nI'm not completely sold on returning to this series – I didn't even finish the first season – but I'd be lying if I said this trailer didn't pique my interest. Perhaps I'm a sucker for the staples of Halo and the story of Reach, or maybe I have a terrible memory; perhaps it's a combination of both. \nCheck out the Season 2 trailer for Halo: The Series for yourself below: \n\n\nParamount+ renewed Halo: The Series for a second season early in the show's first season, so it's clear the streamer is committed to this property for now.

Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the \"About This Product\" section of the controller, you'll find, \"Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions.\" This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that \"offers easy click-in charging.\" \nGame Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it's real, and will update this story if it learns more. \nIf you're interested in a controller upgrade you can make right now, check out the PS5 DualSense Edge.

The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.\nWe loved the first season and can't wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren't alone either – The Last of Us' premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. \nThe first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II. \nWhat do you think of this casting?

Reasons why included a desire for better wages, increased safety precautions, and protections around exploitative uses of artificial intelligence. Now, just a few months later, SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with Replica Studios, an A.I. voice technology company, to allow game developers to use A.I. voices, as reported by Game Developer. \nVarious video game voice actors, like Yong Yea, the new English voice of Kazuma Kiryu in the Like a Dragon series, have publicly stated that they and other actors they know were not aware of this. \"Every voice actor I know not only didn't approve this,\" Yea writes in a tweet. \"[They] pretty much heard about this for the first time today on Twitter.\" \nEvery voice actor I…",

Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019's Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.\nWe're thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!\nhttps://t.co/BZRimbXww6\nJanuary 9, 2024\nAbby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it's fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.\nDespite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards.

The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.\nThe Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. \nIndiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game's story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory's Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It's unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.\nMicrosoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. \nThe Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.\nXbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. \nAra: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.",

The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.\nLike Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. \nLearning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.\n\n\nImmortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.",

          "description": "Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the \"opening movie,\" which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called \"Full Moon Full Life.\" \nIn it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. \nCheck out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more about the game, check out Game Informer's hands-on preview of Persona 3 Reload and then read Game Informer's list of all upcoming video game remakes. After that, watch the newest episode of The Game Informer Show to find out why Persona 3 Reload is one of our most anticipated games of 2024. \nAre you going to check out Persona 3 Reload next month?

          "description": "The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.\nSpecifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.\n\n\nSilent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). \nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Bread will never be the same again. \nFeast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. \n\nThe toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. \nThose interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.",

          "description": "When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. \nOn January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the \"hypertapping\" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and \"rolling,\" discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. \n\n\nIt took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. \nIGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. \nFor more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records. \n[Source: BBC, IGN]\nAre there any video game records you think you could beat?

That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.\nSpeaking to the Polish outlet Parkiet, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now.

Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, \"the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.\" So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.\nOriginal story:\nStar Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, \"And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.\"\nStar Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.\nFor more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Its first two titles, Detention and Devotion, impressed and terrified fans with frighteningly strong horror chops, but the team is leaving that behind to tackle something completely different in Nine Sols. This side-scrolling action platformer blends sci-fi with Chinese mythology and is Red Candle’s most ambitious project yet. This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.\nRed Candle Games began in 2014 when designer Coffee Yao was developing a prototype for Detention.

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.\nThat game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time.
