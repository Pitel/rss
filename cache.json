So while a revival of Yars’ Revenge really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, we have to admit to being a bit taken aback by Yars Rising. After all, what was once a stylish, yet basic top-down shooter has now been transformed into a full-blown Metroidvania with anime-inspired character design, a bonkers, world-ending plot, and gameplay that blends stealth, hacking, and good ol’-fashioned gunplay. Atari, yer mad.\nThe thing is, though, it works. We can’t imagine that this is the future kids in the early ‘80s had in mind when they first shoved that massive Yars’ Revenge cartridge into an Atari 2600 (and maybe OG developer Howard Scott Warshaw’s long-gestating sequel will be more on par with expectations), but after completing Yars Rising, we honestly couldn’t be more thrilled by developer WayForward’s ambitious interpretation of such a classic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.\nThat Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.\nRugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Wanna take you for a ride.\nThere was some deserved hype surrounding Capcom’s first Fighting Collection, preserving the best of Street Fighter and Darkstalkers, and including a delicious Red Earth bonus for good measure. The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.\nFeaturing seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.\nBut nah, turns out it’s fine. Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.\nFair warning then that this might be a 'whack on DLSS/FSR and be done with' kind of job, if it’s faster framerates you seek. But we’ll get to that further down; first, a newly post-launch sitrep of how Space Marine 2 performs on different hardware.\n Read more",

They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

          "description": "Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a \"postcolonial 4X game\", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

          "description": "Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn’t gone down too well with fans of the co-op roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.\nGearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

          "description": "The slugcat of Rain World is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities. \nRead more",

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, \"Hmmm, what if I do make a return\". This happens every time.

At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.\nSupermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, \"where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated\". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.\n Read more",

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And that original title might have spoiled one of the game's biggest twists.\n\n\nObviously, know that major spoilers for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will follow. If you haven't finished the game yet, read at your own peril.\n\n\nNintendo released the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom \"Master Works\" art book in Japan on August 30, 2024.

          "description": "One of the most divisive mechanics since its addition to the franchise, the ability to flop is seen by many NBA 2K25 players as a good tool when facing even matchups, as well as a sure way to lighten the mood when playing with friends.  \n\n\nBut how can you perform the move in the game? Here's how to perform flops in NBA 2K25. \n\n\nHow to flop in NBA 2K25\n\n\nA MyCarrer exclusive feature, you can flop in NBA 2K25 by simply pressing the down-direction button on your controller. But you won't be able to do so from the get-go. Instead, you will need to first purchase and equip the emote to your MyPlayer. You can check out how to purchase and equip the flop animation below: \n\n\n\nWhile in MyCarrer, head to Animations before going to the Animations Store.\n\n\nHead to In-Game Celebrations and then to either NBA Pro-AM Standing or Park Standard.\n\n\nSelect the flop animation on either section and then head to Cart to purchase it. The animation will cost 100 VC.\n\n\nHead to the Gameplay Animations tab and equip Flop to both NBA Pro-AM Standing and Park Standard to get access to it.\n\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nShould you flop in NBA 2K25?\n\n\nI don't recommend performing or having the flop emote equipped in NBA 2K25, no matter if you plan on using it while building your legacy or while letting off steam in The City. The reason for that is quite simple, even if we consider the small chance a foul will be called after performing it, you will 100% of the time open a path for the attacker. When playing any non-5v5 mode, that will then lead to guaranteed points. Performing it by mistake when playing on defense can also give a feeling that you are throwing the game. \n\n\nNow that you know how to perform flops, don't forget to also check out the best jump shots for all builds, as well as all badge requirements in NBA 2K25.\n\nThe post How to flop in NBA 2K25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Analogue has announced the next special edition color lineup for their Analogue Pocket consoles. These ones are based on the colors of Nintendo’s Game Boy Color handhelds.\n\n\nThe GBC Colors Edition (I know, Game Boy Color Colors, but it’s an understandable distinction) brings 6 new special edition, er, colors. There’s Dandelion, Kiwi, Grape, Teal, Berry, and Gold. Now, if you’re really astute, you might be thinking, “Why Gold and not Atomic Purple,” since that was the actual six colors available at release. I can’t tell you for certain, but it’s probably because they already had a translucent purple as part of their transparent series. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the Pokemon Gold/Silver special edition GBC was gold? I researched this, but couldn’t find one in good lighting.\n\n\nAnyway, the GBC Colors Editions are functionally the same as previous models. They’re FPGA-powered handhelds that can run  Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games using hardware emulation, which is significantly more accurate than the usual software emulation that cheaper clones use. People like them. I like their Analogue Duo. More colors are neat.\n\n\nI got the Kiwi Green shade of GBC when I was younger. I also got a matching green carrying case with a Pikachu on it. It had a thin shoulder strap and my sister and cousins teased me, calling it the Poképurse. In retrospect, that’s not very insulting, but they called it that in a really mean way, so I kind of felt ashamed. This is why I have shame and guilt issues as an adult. A contributing factor, at least.\n\n\nThe GBC Colors editions of the Analogue Pocket will go up for sale on September 12th at 8am PDT and ship within 24 to 48 hours. A restock of the original black/white versions are also coming at that time. The special Editions run for $249.99 USD, which is $30 more expensive than the normal, non-limited colors.\n\nThe post Analogue’s new line of GBC shaded Pockets really speaks to me appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, even if you have the mission active, you won't find a map marker for this particular character.\n\n\nCaptain Jones location in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4\n\n\nCaptain Jones is an NPC that spawns in two separate locations. The first spot is a building between the Nitrodrome and The Raft. Nestled between these two POIs is an unnamed location where Captain Jones will roam around, waiting for you to report back to him during this season's storyline.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMore specifically, this spot is next to a railroad track directly east of The Raft, southwest of Restored Reels, and northwest of the Nitrodome. It can be hard to find initially, so keep your eyes peeled for a large building near this section of the tracks.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHis more common spawn spot is at an unnamed location between Restored Reels and Nitrodome. This time, rather than heading slightly west past the railroad track, you'll move toward a small building between these two spots, east of the road.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSince these aren't popular landing spots, you'll likely only find a few other players in these areas. However, if someone arrives at The Raft to eliminate Emma Frost or the Nitrodome, they might pass through these locations and catch you. Watch your surroundings, and don't be afraid to search around for weapons beforehand.\n\n\nCaptain Jones has multiple uses in Fortnite outside of story quests. You can talk to him to restore your health or buy weapons like the Captain America Shield and Monarch Pistols. There's also extra dialogue about other characters you'll find in the event if you're interested in some Fortnite and Marvel lore.\n\nThe post How to talk to Captain Jones about next steps in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I have found problems with the defensive coverages outside the deep third, and it now appears that they were working in an unintended fashion. While the total number of fixes in this patch is few, they do take care of some core gameplay concerns.\n\n\nMadden 25 Title Update patch notes\n\n\nEA Sports has released the patch notes on Madden 25's community forum, and the official blog post is also available on X. Let's examine all the changes.\n\n\n\nAddressed the issue with Smart Routed Custom Stems, resulting in a Speed Boost off the line at the snap\n\n\nTuning to decrease the effectiveness of a specific QB-rollout speed boost exploit\n\n\nAddressed an issue preventing the Curl Flat zone depth coach adjustment from working properly when set at less than 15 yards\n\n\nAddressed an issue causing Curl Flat defenders to continue to drift away from an eligible receiving threat in close proximity\n\n\nAddressed an issue causing outside Deep Third defenders to get out of position when covering corner routes, or giving up too much cushion vs. corner routes.\n\n\nAddressed an issue in Squads causing the QB control to switch to a teammate at the snap\n\n\n\nAside from improper zone coverages, using Smart Routed Custom Stems would sometimes result in an unfair boost at the snap. That problem will likely cease to exist, thanks to the latest update. Similarly, the effectiveness of QB-rollout speed boost has also been nerfed.\n\n\nFans will certainly hope that the changes made by the September 10 title update will resolve some of the concerns they have had with the gameplay so far.\n\nThe post Madden 25 Title Update patch notes (September 10): Zone coverage fixes and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony kicked off the PS5 Technical Presentation with Mark Cerny by jumping right into the announcement of the PS5 Pro. Cerny then took some time to talk about how cool the PS5 is.\n\n\nHe then talks about how developers want higher framerates than 60fps. Or especially higher than 30fps. Apparently, players choose Performance over Fidelity three-quarters of the time. I tend to swap between the two, depending on the game. The framerate thing seems to be the focus of the presentation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen going over the hardware, Cerny says that it will have a 67% \"larger\" GPU with 28% faster RAM that apparently renders at 45% faster. It improves Ray Tracing speeds. It is also implementing AI Upscaling (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, as they call it). They showed a few games running on both systems and how it improves the framerate without cutting down on the appearance of the game.\n\n\nColor me unimpressed. I can see the difference, sure, but it doesn’t seem all that dramatic. The presentation really pushed the framerate thing. I like higher framerates, but this feels like worse value than I’d get by upgrading my GPU, which, to be fair, could cost about as much as the PS5 Pro. The upgraded visuals seem pretty miniscule for the price they’re asking. There's also no disc drive, so you'd be paying extra for that. For the deep-pocketed enthusiast, I suppose.\n\n\nIf you’re into it, it’s going to set you back $699. For me, I could barely afford the base model. I'll probably skip on the upgrade. Unless you want to gift it to me.\n\nThe post The PS5 Pro is finally announced for a dizzying $700 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Whether this is a good thing is certainly debatable, but at least the EXP rewards are nice. \n\n\nHow to graffiti Doomstadt in Fortnite \n\n\nGraffitiing Doomstadt requires using sprays to paint icons around the landmark.

Sea of Legends is described as “a deck-building, open-world, computer role-playing game.” The press release also says to “Imagine a new Sid Meiers’ Pirates game with the tactics and narrative of Shadowrun and Slay the Spire’s deck-building mechanics.”\n\n\nImage via Endless Adventures\n\n\nIt also sums up the team behind it as including, “Andrew McIntosh, Lead Writer of Battletech, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong, Jeffery Campbell, Narrative Designer on Darkest Dungeon, Dead Rising 4, and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Kate Cruz, Senior Concept artist on Ubisoft’s Skull & Bones, and Jordan Weisman himself.” There are some things in that list that should maybe have caveats, but, regardless, it’s a good team. It’s based on the tabletop game by Zach Weisman and Ryan Schapals.\n\n\nIt’s also being made in the Adventure Forge platform. I spoke to Jordan Weisman about it some yonks back. It’s a no-code engine that incorporates generative AI for art assets if the creator wants it (it doesn’t say if Sea of Legends will use it). It will, at the very least, be a demonstration of what the tool can do.\n\n\nI’m interested to see how naval combat is handled. I’m also interested in the feature “lovers to woo.” So, basically, I’m into sailing and smooching. The mock-up included shows the ability to fight, negotiate, or romance to get some treasure. Not sure how that last one works. \"We should spend all this gold on a dog that we can spoil together.\"\n\n\nThe Sea of Legends Kickstarter campaign will kick off on October 1, 2024.\n\nThe post Sea of Legends is an open-world pirate RPG from Shadowrun’s creator appeared first on Destructoid.",

During Part Four: The Illusionist, you'll target Mysterio by messing around with Doomstadt, including destroying various surveillance cameras monitoring the area.\n\n\nWhere to find surveillance cameras in Fortnite\n\n\nYou'll find surveillance cameras scattered around Doomstadt, particularly along the outer walls of buildings, looking down at various pathways. Below are some specific locations for them:\n\n\n\nAlong the walls and building foundations surrounding the central statue\n\n\nOn building pillars, including ones on Doomstadt's outer edges\n\n\nScattered around the city, pointing toward alleyways and sidewalks\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nThey'll appear as small green and white cameras throughout the landmark, each with around 80 health. You likely won't break them instantly with one pickaxe swing or gunshot, but at least they're weaker than slurp barrels and players.\n\n\nAlthough you need to break five surveillance cameras to finish this quest, there are far more than five in Doomstadt to target. They'll always be along solid surfaces like walls, building foundations, and pillars, so focus on checking these areas first for the best odds of finding all five quickly. They're also all outside, so don't worry about going inside buildings for these.\n\n\nYou'll also have to watch for other players, henchmen, and Mysterio, as usual. Entering the center square puts you at risk of entering Mysterio's line of sight, while outer areas might have a player that can catch you off guard with attacks and eliminate you. Make sure to have extra weapons handy and a few hiding spots in mind just in case.\n\nThe post How to destroy surveillance cameras in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Although Fortnite's quests usually have you eliminating enemies, looking for items, and visiting specific locations, the Marvel storyline is a little different. During Part Four: The Illusionist, your first objective is to drop low-quality weapons in Doomstadt. Fortunately, this is quick and easy if you know a few tricks.\n\n\nHow to toss common items at Doomstadt in Fortnite\n\n\nTossing common items at Doomstadt is another way of saying you need to throw away your weapons. Doing this requires getting at least one common-tier or grey item, traveling to Doomstadt, and throwing it on the ground. You can do this with the same weapon multiple times, so don't worry about looking for five items throughout your match.\n\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to head directly to Doomstadt at the beginning of the match, look around for grey ground loot, and pick it up. Ground items are usually grey or green-quality anyway, so this shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFrom here, open your inventory, hover over your common item, and press the drop button to toss the weapon onto the ground. Now, you can pick it up and repeat the process five times to quickly knock out this quest without much issue.\n\n\nThe only obstacle you might encounter is enemy players finding you and defeating you before you finish dropping your items. Mysterio can also come out of nowhere and attack you if you run within his area of detection. Watch out and listen for anyone nearby, and pick an obscure location, like inside a building or near a hiding spot, to keep yourself away from others. In dire situations, you can sit beside a car and drive away briefly if your character is close to death before returning and finishing the objective.\n\nThe post How to toss common items at Doomstadt in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, there's one problem: several of our friends got brainwashed, and it's up to us to help them. Here's how to wake up brainwashed characters in Fortnite.\n\n\nHow to wake up Brainwashed Characters in Fortnite\n\n\nFortnite Chapter 5, Season 4 has three characters you'll have to visit and wake up for this quest:\n\n\n\nRust\n\n\nBrite Raider\n\n\nPeabody\n\n\n\nYou'll find all three characters in the southern half of the map, with Rust residing near Sandy Steppes, Brite Raider near Brutal Beachhead, and Peabody south of the Nitrodome. You can find their exact locations by tracking the objective in your quest list.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you approach a character, speak to them to initiate brainwash-reversing dialogue. After they talk about Doom taking over the world, they'll snap out of it and reveal what caused it, bringing you one step closer to solving this problem. You'll even get small rewards like shield potions and medkits out of it, so it's worth visiting these characters regardless of what you're doing.\n\n\nWhile eliminating hired followers is another way to complete this objective, visiting these three locations is much easier, especially since you can do this during one match.\n\n\nWatch out as you're doing this, though. Other players can easily storm the area and eliminate you or the character you're talking to, preventing you from finishing the quest during that match. If someone approaches the area, talk them out quickly before continuing.\n\nThe post How to wake up Brainwashed Characters in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The latter parts of the year are no doubt an exciting time if you're hugely into the Call of Duty franchise. Or even if you just take a passing interest in it. Black Ops 6 is just weeks away from release, but there is a little bit of bad news for those who were hoping for some early access fun.\n\n\nAccording to a statement sent to CharlieINTEL on X – an account that tracks all things related to CoD – Activision has decided to forgo early access for the campaign for this installment. The full statement reads thus:\n\n\n\nThe team is fully focused on October 25th. We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25th. As such, there is no Early Access beat this year for Black Ops 6, just the countdown to launch.\n\n\n\n\nBlack Nope 6\n\n\nAs you can imagine, this isn't going down too well with the Call of Duty fan base. A quick look at some of the responses to CharlieINTEL's posts shows more than a few are not happy with the decision Activision has gone ahead with, just weeks before the game launches.\n\n\nBlack Ops 6 will represent the first in the franchise under the Microsoft umbrella. The tech giant bought Activision Blizzard – and therefore the CoD brand – back in 2022 for an eye-watering $69 billion, despite backlash from some regulatory bodies.\n\n\nMany were initially concerned the acquisition would make the Call of Duty games Xbox exclusives, but Microsoft assured worried gamers this would not be the case. However, Black Ops 6 not having campaign early access is going to leave a sour taste in a lot of people's collective mouths.\n\nThe post Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 won’t have early access for the campaign appeared first on Destructoid.",

Then, after loading up your power level and/or grinding an appropriately high level of gear, you jump into the final mission that's sometimes equally as impressive as the intro. Cue the outro cutscene, and you're done. According to Bung…",
