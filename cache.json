          "description": "\"Are you tiny Thor, god of tiny hammers?\".\nTiny Thor from Asylum Square has been a long time coming. After one of its lead developers came up with a rough cut of its concept in a 48-hour game jam in 2012, its development proceeded in fits and starts for a little over a decade before it finally saw release this past June. Games that spend that long in development hell can be notoriously uneven, but we’re happy to report that Tiny Thor has proven to be worth the wait. This is a tough, gorgeous, and altogether great retro platformer that you ought to consider picking up.\nThe 16-bit-inspired game follows the adventures of the titular Asgardian warrior during a time long before he was the buff, long-haired hero you all know—the story here opens on his eighth birthday. As a present, Odin gifts him the legendary Mjolnir hammer, which Thor immediately takes to. While he’s out fooling around with his new toy, the boy is approached by a certain mischievous individual, who tricks him into destroying the anchor of the Bifrost, cutting off all of Asgard from Midgard. Joined by his father’s ravens, Tiny Thor thus sets out to repair the damage and prevent Ragnarök from causing the end of the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "And Nintendo reconfirms its interest in future films.\nThe most recent Nintendo financial report is packed full of sales figures for games and consoles alike, but let's not forget that the Big-N is now in the world of films too. On a note about expanding the company's IP, the report revealed the viewing numbers from The Super Mario Bros. Movie's box office which is estimated (by Universal Pictures) to have pulled in a whopping 168.10 million viewers.\nThis will likely come as no surprise. The Mario Movie was breaking records straight out of the gate, quickly becoming the highest-grossing video game adaptation after just one week. It has since gone on to become one of the biggest animated movies of all time with a box office taking of $1.349 billion, according to the report — Nintendo describes this as \"the second-highest for an animated film\" though figures from Box Office Mojo place the 2019's The Lion King and Frozen 2 above it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You build up a city, explore and conquer new lands, unlock research and ultimately push everyone's faces in, but its other main pillar is tower defence, a genre I very rarely align with. Which is a good sign, right? Two good reasons not to choose it, but I am anyway.\nRead more",

          "description": "How does one make a sequel to a basically perfect game? 2007's physics-platformer-in-a-weird-science-facility Portal is a lodestar piece of game design from top to bottom. It's one of my favourite games, and I went into 2011's Portal 2 with many a reservation. But it's very good! And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it's quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.\nI could do \"the joy of Portal 2's retro science\", where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do \"the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2\", a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do \"the joy of potatoes in Portal 2\". And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant's character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).\nRead more",

All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.\nSeason 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.\nRead more",

Larian Studios’ RPG also happens to have earned Valve’s Playable rating for Steam Deck compatibility, which usually signals a game that’s most fine on the SteamOS handheld – it might just have some small text, or no 16:10 display support. \nThat Playable certification will have been granted off its early access performance, and now that I’ve wandered around the review build for a few hours, I can confirm that playable it most certainly is, with some especially smart control tweaks to accommodate a lack of mouse and keyboard. Actually getting to that point, however, was a minor nightmare, plagued by hard crashes that took one of the Steam Deck’s most obscure tools to fix. As such, before we get into how Baldur’s Gate 3 runs on the Steam Deck or which settings you should use for it, I hope you’ll afford me a rant.\nRead more",

The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.\nUpon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.\nRead more",

For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy.

          "description": "Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. \nThere are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation. \nRead more",

          "description": "\"We don't go to Ravenholm…\" Half-Life 2's sixth chapter heading warns, and when you arrive at the outskirts of this abandoned mining town, you immediately see why. This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. \nBut I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: \"We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun.\" This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be. \nRead more",

It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. \nThronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level. \nRead more",

          "description": "When I was a kid growing up in rural New Mexico, I dreaded the first day of school. I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. \nThat's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor. \n\nGet the LG 27GR95QE 27-inch 240Hz 1440p OLED gaming monitor for $718 w/ code SAVE4SCHOOL (was $999)\n\nRead more",

It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.\nRead more",

          "description": "I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, \"Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.\nIt was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you'd also be totally and utterly wrong. \nRead more",

Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.\nI think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present.

          "description": "The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.\nThe Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show. \nRead more",

That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites \"tie into\" its RPG systems.

The answer is weirdly simple. Limgrave provides me with everything I could ever want from a Souls game to the point that when Godrick croaks his final rancid breath and his (presumably) four tongues comically lop out of his stupid mouth, I’m left with the deep satisfaction that comes with the end of a journey, rather than the beginning of one.\nRead more",

          "description": "Grinding Gear Games debuted a lovely big chunk of Path Of Exile 2 this evening, taking us through a section of Act 3 of its campaign and showing off two of its six new character classes: the Monk and the Sorceress. With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.\nRead more",

It's loud and bright without being obnoxious or overwhelming, fast and precise without being overly demanding, and generally just a damn good effort at creating a modern action platformer whose main influence is obvious, but isn't just going through the motions for the sake of nostalgia. I'm saying it's good, yeah? Maybe not quite for me, but good anyway.\nRead more",

You might need some tips.\nWhile I wouldn't call myself a D&D 5E expert, I've followed the Early Access of Baldur's Gate 3 for a while and, at the time of this writing, put a solid chunk of hours into the launch state of BG3.

Okay, now it’s time to win that last Dunko card.\nI’m not sure what I expected from The Coin Game, but it certainly wasn’t what I got. On the surface, it looks like a simulator for those horrible games in malls and bowling alleys. The ones that are barely games and dangle amazing prizes are just out of reach. However, that’s not what The Coin Game is about.\nThe real concept of The Coin Game is that you’re trapped in the simulation of a rural town, and your only means of coping with your nightmarish existence is to gamble for cheap prizes.

For example, you can take things back to Bethesda days of yore by picking up the first two Elder Scrolls game for free. Even Morrowind (the third entry in the series) is going dirt cheap.\nIf retro shooters are your thing, the first four Quake games are on offer, while Wolfenstein 3D is a staggering 70% off. Of course, you can't talk classic FPS without mentioning Doom and, yep, they're currently discounted as well.\nFor those who don't know, QuakeCon is an annual game convention that began in 1996. Originally a way for people to celebrate the early Quake and Doom releases, the event has since ballooned into something bigger.\nThis year will see QuakeCon 2023 return to in-person after being a digital-only convention for the past three years.

Despite the fact it still resembles the Silent Hill 2 villain, you can't help but coo at him in this context.\nhttps://twitter.com/atc_experience/status/1686678228616859648\nWhile the plush isn't available until January 4, 2024, you can pre-order one from the website, currently priced at €34.99 (about $38 US).\nNo sign of a James Sunderland plush, though\nOf course, what a lot of you are waiting for–besides soft toy versions of demonic creatures–is the Silent Hill 2 remake. Helmed by Layers of Fear and The Medium studio, Bloober Team, there's a lot riding on whether a modern telling of this classic horror game will be a success.\nThe original 2001 release is such an influential part of the genre that any studio handling a remake will be up against a lot of pressure.\nWe're still not sure when it's coming out, though an Australian retailer did suggest it's due to release on September 29. Neither Konami nor the developer have confirmed this, so we can't say for certain whether this launch window is accurate.\nAll we know is there's plenty of Silent Hill 2 fans who are unsure whether Bloober has what it takes to do the source material justice.

I believed they’d do this eventually, but it’s Two Point Campus: Medical School. It’s coming August 17th to all platforms.\nI was just wondering when we’d get the next piece of DLC. We last got School Spirits back in March, and we just passed the anniversary for the base game, so I figured we were due. I was actually digging through a few press sites to see if I could get a hint on whether something was coming, but Sega knows how to keep a surprise.\nhttps://youtu.be/qKCnO3RNYws\nAs the name implies, Medical School will have you training up your hapless puppet students in the ways of healing. Like the Space Academy DLC, this one comes with three new levels to tackle. There are six new types of rooms, and many of the courses seem to offer some furniture ripped straight from Two Point Hospital. Alongside the new content, there’s also an array of fresh challenges to tackle in this DLC.\nTwo Point Campus was one of my favorite releases from 2022, and I’ve been hungrily eating up all the DLC as it gets released. This one will definitely be no different. The release schedule so far has given me just enough time to recharge and be ready to dive back in. Personally, though, I’m hoping there’s new radio DJ segments dropping with this pack.\nTwo Point Campus is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Medical School DLC will be dropping on August 17th for $9.99 USD.\nThe post Two Point Campus comes full circle with Medical School DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although it originally skipped the last-gen consoles, the EA first-quarter earnings call revealed that Respawn has PS4 and Xbox One ports on the way for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As the released EA report brief reveals, the company is looking to continue capitalizing on its financially well-performing franchises, including Star Wars Jedi.\n[caption id=\"attachment_375326\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nEA is not done with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor yet\nAs reported by The Verge, EA CEO Andrew Wilson announced during the earnings call that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will come to PS4 and Xbox One, though a release date wasn't mentioned. This is an unexpected turn of events, as in an interview with PLAY Magazine (as reported by Game Rant) game director Stig Asmussen had previously stated that Jedi: Survivor was skipping last-gen consoles to ensure a \"true new-gen experience in the Star Wars universe.\"\nThe financial report points to Star Wars Jedi and FIFA as the catalysts for its first-quarter performance. It highlights that in addition to attracting millions of players globally, Jedi: Survivor is also “seeing players spend more time in-game than its predecessor.” FIFA was noted for “delivering a record Q1 for the franchise,” and this comes as the series undergoes massive rebranding following the end of EA’s partnership with FIFA. The next entry in the series will be titled EA Sports FC 24.\nRespawn has continually been working on the game since its launch, with patches being released to improve performance on all gaming platforms. Time will tell how developers will manage to ensure smooth performance on the dated last-gen consoles.\nThe post EA is working on PS4 and Xbox One version of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Tekken 8 was originally announced in 2022, and a Closed Network Test was recently released on multiple platforms in July. To the dismay of the developers, some gamers have since cracked the CNT to play it in unintended ways. Bandai Namco is warning players against playing Tekken 8's cracked CNT, and those caught could face consequences.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392950\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nBe patient or risk a ban\nPlayers with the cracked CNT can not only play the game offline, but continue to play it beyond the test period. In a Twitter post, Bandai Namco warned that this violates its Terms of Service and the Tekken World Tour's Code of Conduct.\nhttps://twitter.com/BNEesports/status/1685978121948770305\nUnauthorized access to the CNT could result in a ban from the upcoming Tekken World Tour and other official tournaments. In other words, competitive players may want to heed this warning. It is understandable why developers would emphasis this penalty in particular. Those playing the cracked version would have a headstart on practice, which could affect the results of official tournaments.\nThis isn't the only problem the CNT has caused, as it has also resulted in Tekken 8's partial roster leaking. Though Bandai Namco has officially announced 16 characters, the leak reveals a longer list of playable fighters.\nIt has certainly been a good time for fighting game fans. Street Fighter 6 launched to critical acclaim in June, and Mortal Kombat 1 will launch on September 19.

          "description": "Crawly Games has announced that their deckbuilder horror game, Draft of Darkness, is leaving Steam Early Access and going full version on August 23, 2023.\nIf you’ve never heard of Draft of Darkness, just look at it. It’s like if Pit-Fighter had a personality beyond just “oiled beef.” It has grainy, digitized actors fighting with grainy, unspeakable horrors in rusty lo-fi locales. It has just the right mixture of goofy and sleaze that makes it seem like a lost PS1 game from the creators of Chiller. Ugh, I suddenly have the urge to play Loaded.\nhttps://youtu.be/9sZE1xr7wvI\nDraft of Darkness was actually billed to me as Slay the Spire meets Resident Evil. It’s an ammo-focused turn-based deckbuilder where you recruit survivors and battle monsters and government robots. It uses a roguelite system. Maps are procedurally generated, and you keep advancing until you’re overwhelmed by the darkness. You gain credits that can buy booster packs after each run, allowing you to build up your arsenal over time.\nIt also has a “meta-story progression system.” They say, “Every decision can alter the story's outcome and allow for new ways to progress. Different choices are available in each run, but be careful; some will have serious consequences.”\nI’ve recently had some success when it comes to clicking with deckbuilders recently, and this looks right up my alley. I mean, 90% of that statement comes from just looking at the visuals. It’s like pixelated poetry to me.\nDraft of Darkness is available right now for PC on Steam Early Access. The full version 1.0 will hit on August 23, 2023.\nThe post Draft of Darkness makes its escape from Early Access August 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It looks like Starfield will be taking advantage of the Xbox Play Anywhere feature. Through this, owners of Starfield will be able to swap between Xbox Series X|S and PC, without having to buy copies of the game for both systems.\nThat update was noticed by the Starfield Beyond Twitter account, a profile that (as the name heavily implies) chronicles all things related to Bethesda's upcoming space epic. The Starfield store page does currently have the tag.\nhttps://twitter.com/starfieldbeyond/status/1686137526010908673?\nTo infinity, and – wait, wrong franchise\nFor those who don't know, Play Anywhere lets you own a game on Xbox and Windows-based PCs at no additional cost. This also means your saves will carry over between systems, so you could literally start playing on one and smoothly transition to the other without any fuss.\nWith Starfield offering the Xbox Play Anywhere feature, it pretty much means you can have two copies of the game with one purchase. Maybe not everyone will benefit from being able to switch playing \"Skyrim in space\" between console and PC, but it's a neat little bonus if you're into that sort of thing.\nI think it's safe to say we're pretty much ready for Starfield now. We've had everything from the game's PC specs to a 1,000-page compendium outlining as much info as possible. Seems like all that's left is for the game to launch. And it's not far off either. Starfield will touch down on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 6, 2023.\nThe post You’ll only need one copy of Starfield to play on either Xbox or PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is getting a limited Collector's Edition. A post over on THQ's website says there's only going to be 5,000 of these made worldwide, so you might want to get in quick if you want one.\nThe Collector's Edition will feature a fair amount of bonus material, including both a statue and miniature, a steelbook case for the game, some DLC (which includes the Derceto 1992 costume pack), and more. You can check out the trailer for this special edition below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2L3LPpu9I\nReturn to the dark\nWe all know that Resident Evil is one of the most influential survival horror series of all time. However, Alone in the Dark actually predates Capcom's legendary franchise by four years.\nThe first Alone in the Dark game set the scene for the genre and while it's massively dated now, it's been cemented in gaming history as a landmark part of horror. Sadly, subsequent releases and attempts at reboots haven't had much of an impact, being overshadowed by other games that have come after it.\nHowever, Alone in the Dark is making another comeback. A recent video uploaded to publisher THQ Nordic's YouTube page gives a brief teaser of the upcoming title, which is being developed by Magicka 2 studio Pieces Interactive.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtrvT7aDL1s\nWhile previous attempts at bringing Alone in the Dark into the modern world have not gone down well, horror fans will still be looking forward to this entry.\nWith Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and Stranger Things' David Harbour on board (not to mention a story crafted by Amnesia and SOMA writer Mikael Hedberg), there's enough intrigue here to hopefully give the iconic horror series another crack at video game modernity.\nAlone in the Dark is due for release on October 25, and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Alone in the Dark Collector’s Edition announced, along with a creepy teaser appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dead by Daylight is one of those games that wears its horror influences on its sleeve. We've already seen Behaviour Interactive's asymmetrical survival game crossover with franchises like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. We've also recently been treated to Nicolas Cage, so anything's possible with this game. Now, it's the Alien franchise's turn to get the Dead by Daylight collaboration treatment.\nA recent teaser over on the official YouTube channel shows that the Xenomorph will be coming to Dead by Daylight. No date on when this will actually be happening has been announced, but the short clip says we can \"learn more on August 8.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/8h6BLFUkbeM\nSuffice it to say, if you're a fan of Dead by Daylight and of the Alien films (or at least two of them), then this update is going to be right up your dark and dingy corridor.\nIn space, no one can hear you crank a generator\nSince releasing in 2016, Dead by Daylight has become a force to be reckoned with in the horror community. If you haven't had a chance to play it, essentially the game involves four players trying to survive against one player who takes on the role of the killer on a murderous rampage.\nSome notable villains and survivors from the world of horror have been implemented over the years, including Ghost Face from the Scream franchise, Evil Dead's Ash, and even the creepy girl from The Ring.\nThe game became so popular that a Dead by Daylight movie adaptation is currently in the pipeline from famed production company Blumhouse. We all know that video games being translated to the big screen isn't always the best move.\nHowever, it could be interesting to see how a co-operative multiplayer game featuring a ton of classic horror monsters will work on film. And, of course, there's the aforementioned Alien crossover to look forward to as well.\nThe post Dead by Daylight is getting an Alien collaboration appeared first on Destructoid.",

The tough co-op shooter wears its FromSoftware influence on its sleeve, which has resonated with fans and critics alike. The developers have revealed that Remnant 2 has already sold over a million copies, exceeding the first game's launch sales by a considerable amount.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394243\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nRemnant 2 soars to the top of the charts\nWhen Remnant: From the Ashes hit shelves in 2019, it took two months before it sold over a million copies. As Gunfire Games has announced, the sequel achieved this feat in just four days. Yoon Im of Gearbox Publishing stated that \"Remnant 2 exceeded our expectations. As a commercial and critical hit, we’re incredibly proud of the Gunfire team and everyone here at Gearbox Publishing who brought this title to life.\"\nThere were early signs that Remnant 2 was gearing up for an explosive launch. Before its release, it had claimed the top spot on Steam's best-seller list, overtaking trending titles like Starfield and BattleBit Remastered. It currently sits in third place, surpassed only by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Baldur's Gate 3. When it was finally released, it doubled the number of concurrent players its predecessor had at launch.\nThe high sales numbers have been accompanied by plenty of critical acclaim, with our own Steven Mills scoring it an impressive 8.5.

However, they did go on to say, “I would like to continue to express myself in-game music through various genres of music. I hope you will look forward to my music in the future!” So, whether or not they return for the next Souls-like FromSoftware title, it sounds like they plan to remain in the games industry, just not under FromSoftware's umbrella.\nIt still hasn’t been said if Kitamura will be doing the soundtrack for the upcoming Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC or Armored Core 6.

          "description": "Look, we all want a third installment in Valve's iconic Half-Life series. But the sad truth is, it's almost certainly never going to happen. As such, we're stuck with the first two (as well as the VR game Alyx). But that's a good thing, because Half-Life 1 and 2 are exemplary first-person shooters. So loved is the series, that fans continue to tweak and mod Half-Life and Half-Life 2 to their own ends.\nTake Team Vestige over on ModDB (via PCGamesN), which has taken the legendary sci-fi FPS and turned it into a horror experience. Called \"Disrepair,\" this mod for Half-Life 2 sees the player slip into the hazard suit of a Combine worker who's been sent to investigate and photograph the radioactive anomalies that have cropped up around the Black Mesa facility.\nhttps://youtu.be/QX-DsNWBp6g\nWhat ensues is a short but creepy experience, not too dissimilar to the likes of Slender: The Eight Pages. The player is tasked with photographing several pieces of artifacts around the infected building, while ominous sounds drill into their ears. It also has a slight SCP vibe about it, in that internet-urban-myth kind of way. You can see YouTube user Farawaygaming diving into \"Despair\" above.\nTake that, Ravenholm!\nWhen you think of Half-Life, you probably don't think of the word \"horror.\" While the games do have their more unsettling moments (the Ravenholm section in HL2 springs to mind), it's not a franchise known for scares.\nThat's why this Half-Life 2 mod, and others like it, are so interesting. They take something that has a very distinctive aesthetic about it and turn it into something that's fairly unsettling. With the tunnel vision-style lighting, black and white graphics, and the eerie tones of this darker side of Black Mesa, Team Vestige is just one of many reasons people keep returning to the Half-Life games after all these years.\nThe post Slenderman meets SCP in this Half-Life 2 horror mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

It comes with a new type of ghost based on a Real Ghostbusters figure, a new level, and some new customization options from the 2016 reboot.\nThe new map takes place in a concert venue, the New Motion Club. It lets you bust ghosts backstage before, I assume, you then dance the night away with some of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance.

With that date fast approaching, they’ve released a new trailer highlighting all the features of it.\nhttps://youtu.be/EHwI-4IxivY\nI kept getting The Sims in the post-apocalypse vibes from the trailer, and then the hot tub showed up and cemented it. And then I kept watching and thinking, like, “Oh no, this is nothing like The Sims,” but then I just realized that it’s a lot like post-apocalypse The Sims if you took away all the other Sims and let them travel around scavenging.\nSo, in I Am Future, you play as Chris, potentially the only human left on Earth. And they seem kind of all right with that. I don’t blame them. Their goal is not only to survive but also to search for other survivors and try to unravel the mystery of why the world ended. You explore the sunken city, tear things apart for building materials, and build up your base of operations. You can even build robots to help you with all your chores.\nI Am Future is launching into Early Access with “a part” of the main story. The goal for the team is to add new features, areas to explore, and story content over time. They state that they don’t want to keep it “in Early Access for too long,” but are unwilling to give a more detailed estimate on how long they expect it to last.\nI Am Future launches into Steam Early Access on August 8.

These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. \nA spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: \n“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”\nStriking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. \nThe Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.  \n[Source: IGN]",

However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). \nJokes on you, real key art here.\npic.twitter.com/UCCexH7IMr\nAugust 2, 2023\nAs you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. \nIn the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

          "description": "Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nHe did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. \n\n\n“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. \nFallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” \nWhile waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that. \n[Source: The Verge]\nAre you waiting to play Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PS4 or Xbox One?

Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. \nYou can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” \nWhen Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. \nSparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30. \nWhile waiting for this DLC to go live, read Game Informer’s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review. For more Mario, check out the reveal trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and then watch the Super Mario RPG remake trailer afterward.\nAre you playing through Rayman in the Phantom Show later this month? Let us know in the comments below!",

Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. \nWhile its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below: \nSoon. pic.twitter.com/vEWhnFPsTb\nAugust 1, 2023\nAs you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. \n“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.\n\"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” \n\nWe’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023. \nWhat do you think of the game’s teaser?

Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. \nYou can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:\n\n\nFortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. \nAs for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. \nFortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan. \nAre you going to pick up any of these Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins?

          "description": "Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. \nVGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). \n\n\nThe publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. \nVGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.\nIn February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. \nRegardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nWhat do you want from a next-gen Nintendo console?

          "description": "Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. \nXbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.\nHere's what Spencer had to say:\nSpencer says this is a seminal moment \"in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future,\" perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. \nWhile the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. \nThis means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. \nFor more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \nAre you going to be checking out Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox Series X/S?

          "description": "Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. \nSquare Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. \nCheck out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nYoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. \n“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”\nFor more about Dawntrail, head to Game Informer's story featuring everything you need to know about the expansion. \nStory in development...\nWhat do you think of the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail trailer?

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. \nSony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. \n\n\nThat’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.\nHowever, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.\n\n\nSEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it: \n\n\nFor more, read Game Informer’s PlayStation 5 review to find out why we love the console, and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 best PS5 games after that. \nDo you have a PS5?

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. \nAs was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.\nThe Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.\nTo see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.",

Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up?

Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. \nSea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  \nSea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!",
