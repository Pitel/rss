          "description": "\"We were working on getting the rights to this game for several years\".\n2002's The Thing is widely regarded as one of the best horror games based on an existing media franchise. Many licensed horror games are sadly relegated to genres that require a specific setup, such as asymmetrical multiplayer or short VR experiences, but The Thing — a third-person squad-based shooter — dared to go one step further, telling its own unique story that serves as a proper sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 movie masterpiece.\nIt's not a game that frequents mainstream remaster wishlists, but Nightdive Studios is nevertheless delivering what few of us realised we wanted with The Thing: Remastered. Announced during IGN Live and scheduled to land on the Switch later this year, Computer Artworks' original is getting the full revamp treatment, with updated visuals, improved lighting, numerous quality-of-life tweaks, and more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For one individual, however, carrying a replica Master Sword around in real life has led to a rather unfortunate jail sentence.\nAs covered by Eurogamer, a man named Anthony Bray from Nuneaton, England, was caught with a six-inch replica of the Master Sword while wandering about in public. According to Bray, it was intended to be used as a fidget toy, however, arresting officers stated that it \"was in fact a sharply pointed item which could be used as a weapon and might put others in fear of it being used against them\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That much you could divine from its key art alone, with a girl on a raft sailing through crisp, blue waters towards sparkling white sands.

There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. \"We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons,\" the developers say.

But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head.

          "description": "Assassin’s Creed fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the open world series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, via one of those odd promotional things disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.\nElsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox.

The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

          "description": "Among Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree's more fearsome bosses is the Dancing Lion, a festive prancing terror inspired by Chinese Lion dances. Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it's just two guys in a lion suit. They aren't even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!\r\n \nRead more",

If you want to get your hands on some sought after crafting materials or items, these are a safe bet. \n\n\nIf you’re going in order of the Shared FATEs screen, you’ll likely head to Kozama’uka after completing the required 66 FATEs in Urqopacha.

          "description": "One of the most elusive new items added into Final Fantasy XIV with the Dawntrail expansion was a new hairstyle. It proved difficult to track down, but the source has now become clear, and you’re going to need luck on your side or a hoard of Gil to get it. \n\n\nWhere does It Takes Two come from?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOfficially, Modern Aesthetics - It Takes Two comes from the newly added level 100 Timeworn Br’aaxskin Maps. It’s entirely possible for this to drop from one of the coffers spawned when successfully deciphering a map, but it is also incredibly rare and not without challenge. \n\n\nBr’aaxskin maps are designed for eight people, which makes them pretty challenging. Once you’ve deciphered a map and clicked on the Coffer, you’ll have five minutes to take down waves of enemies in order to gain access to the Coffer itself. \n\n\nNow, I will say that you don’t necessarily need eight people to do this. I’ve managed to defeat all the enemies in a party of two, one Sage and one Dark Knight, though it was a close call both times. You could easily gain access to the Coffer with a group of three or four players. \n\n\nEven if you do manage to get into the Coffer, though, you’re unlikely to be rewarded with It Takes Two, and this is reflected by the current selling price on the Marketboard. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOn Goblin, the hairstyle is currently selling for close to 50 million Gil, purely because of its rarity and the difficulty faced to get it. With that said, if you’re desperate to get your hands on this hairstyle, your best bet might be simply to wait. Once the Cenote Ja Ja Gural treasure dungeon is added in patch 7.05, set to happen on July 29, the selling price is likely to drop significantly.\n\nThe post How to get FFXIV It Takes Two hairstyle in Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

It can also make for some goofy encounters, especially if you have a group of friends emoting together. \n\n\nHow to use emotes in The First Descendant\n\n\nYou can use emotes in The First Descendant by bringing up the emote wheel and selecting one of the eight available options. Depending on your platform, you'll either use the L key on your keyboard or press left on your controller's d-pad. Doing this brings up the menu, where you can hover over an emote and use it. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBy default, you'll have a few sprays and emotes to use, ranging from a sitting emote to a thumbs-up spray, among others. While these are only a few available options, they're a solid start if you want to wave or signal for someone to follow you. You can also equip new emotes at any point if you have a different nonverbal message you want to get across.\n\n\nHow to equip new emotes in The First Descendant\n\n\nIf you don't like your currently equipped emotes or recently unlocked a new one, you can change them by heading into Inventory, Customize, and Emotes. Here, you'll find your list of emotes, which you can swap using the wheel on the right side of your screen.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSome options alongside your default emotes include cheering, a question mark, and stomping in anger. You can even high five someone if you were part of The First Descendant's beta tests. Let's just say if someone messes up during one of your missions, you can make that very clear to them with just a few quick emotes.\n\nThe post How to emote in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hence, only use the fodder required to save the rest for other challenges. \n\n\nTask 1 - Lieke Martens\n\n\n\nFabinho 84\n\n\nWendie Renard 88\n\n\nBernardo Silva 88\n\n\nKoen Casteels 84\n\n\nBruno Fernandes 88\n\n\nChristina Endler 88\n\n\nCucho Hernandez TOTS 88\n\n\nStanislav Lobotka 84\n\n\nLena Oberdorf 87\n\n\nMartin Odegaard 87\n\n\nCody Gakpo 83\n\n\n\nThe 95-rated LW item offers 5* Skills and 5* Weak Foot. You also get three great playstyle+, including Technical+ and Whipped+. While the card won't compete with the top-tier items of the meta, it's no pushover either. Mertens' Flashback version has 94 Pace, 97 Dribbling, 96 Passing, and 95 Shooting, all of which combine pretty well with her work rate and 5* Weak Foot. \n\nThe post EA FC 24: How to complete Lieke Martens Flashback SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari has surprise-dropped Mega Cat Studios' Food Fight: Culinary Combat on Steam today. Previously, the title was only available on Atari’s own VCS console.\n\n\nFood Fight: Culinary Combat is an arena shooter take on the classic Food Fight arcade game. There’s local and online multiplayer, four modes, six maps, and even split-screen.\n\n\n\n\nStrangely, a lot of the marketing information focuses on what goes around the multiplayer itself. There’s an Atariverse hub where you can talk to characters from other games and the creators of the original Food Fight. You can also find circuit boards to unlock Atari arcade games, and more cosmetic items for character customization. Which sounds rad, but I still don’t know much about how the game actually plays. \n\n\nThe four game modes are Buffet Brawl, King of the Cone, Cookie Collector, and Crumbling, which aren’t very descriptive names. The Steam listing has a tag for PvE, which is suggested in the trailer but not in the store blurb.\n\n\nAtari fans seem to look favorably on the VCS version. The most significant complaint I could find was that, because the VCS is a US-only console and it has a small userbase, it was sometimes difficult to find people to play with. Hopefully, with the Steam release, things will be more lively.\n\n\nFood Fight: Culinary Combat is now available for the Atari VCS and PC.

While some of these are expected first-party games, there are a few in the mix that are rather surprising.\n\n\nHere’s the full list:\n\n\n\nUrban Champion\n\n\nGolf\n\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. Math\n\n\nMach Rider\n\n\nThe Mystery of Atlantis\n\n\nSOLAR JETMAN\n\n\nCOBRA TRIANGLE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one that stands out is Mystery of Atlantis, which was never released in North America. Mystery of Atlantis isn’t even the name on its birth certificate; it's Atlantis no Nazo (which really does translate to Mystery of Atlantis), a questionably challenging game from Sunsoft. It features 100 levels, but they’re not sequential. Figuring out how they connect, discovering bizarre secrets to find new exits, and eventually reaching the end is where most of the fun lies. And when I say bizarre secrets, there are instances where you have to jump into what is normally a bottomless pit and another where you have to blow yourself up in a specific spot. It’s not for everyone.\n\n\nOn top of that, we also have the also-questionable Urban Champion, an early fighting game. There’s Donkey Kong Jr. Math if you need to brush up on your arithmetic. Mach Rider and Golf round out the first-party offerings. Then there is also Solar Jetman and Cobra Triangle from Rare’s early days.\n\n\nIt's not exactly the most top-shelf selection of games from the console, but most of them are worth trying out. Maybe not Donkey Kong Jr. Math if you’re out of your grade school years.\n\nThe post Nintendo Switch Online gets seven new NES games including a previously Japan-only release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Billy Kid is one of the starter characters in Zenless Zone Zero. A member of the Cunning Rabits, he takes jobs that send him into the Hollows to do all kinds of things, from saving people to bringing back lost items. He is also quickly becoming a fan favorite, but there is one question people seem to have about him, and that is whether he is even human.\n\n\nIs Billy Kid a robot in Zenless Zone Zero?\n\n\nBilly Kid is a cyborg, not a robot, and there is an important distinction. A robot is an artificial human being, usually housing some form of AI, and cannot be considered human in origin. A cyborg, on the other hand, is a human being that has undergone surgical procedures to have various parts of them replaced with artificial parts, as well as potentially undergoing other biochemical or electronic modifications. \n\n\nBased on his character design, it looks as though much of Billy's body has been replaced by metal parts. We can clearly see that both hands are mechanical, and his entire upper body appears to be as well. It's hard to know if his head has been replaced or if he is just wearing a mask, but we can tell that the excellent hair is certainly still real. \n\n\nWe know that Billy is a huge fan of a fictional show called the Starlight Knights, so it seems likely that his modifications were done to bring him closer to the level of his fictional heroes. Hopefully, as time goes on, we will learn more about Billy and what caused him to want to change his body, or forced him to.\n\nThe post Is Billy Kid a robot in Zenless Zone Zero? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. \nCompanions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.\nAnd it’s always satisfying.\nThe parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…",

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult.

          "description": "With just four days in Seoul, South Korea, I filled my maps app with pins of restaurants, Buddhist temples, must-see attractions, scenic parks, market streets, and more to visit. I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, everyone is glued to their phones, myself included.

          "description": "Throughout my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for Game Informer's current cover story about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, game director Corinne Busche reiterates that the studio designed the game with inclusivity in mind. That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here. \nBut that feeling doesn't end in the character creator.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nIn the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. \nThough Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. \n\n\n\"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,\" the announcement reads. \"By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware.\" \nThough Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix's animated Minecraft series. \nAre you excited about a native Minecraft version for PS5? Let us know in the comments below!",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
