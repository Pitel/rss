That's still a pretty hefty number, but Piscatella reckons there will be some hardware constraints after an initial surge of high demand.

Terrific!\nThis one launched on Steam last year and has since gone on to rack up hundreds of 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews. In it, you play as Terry, a wobbly little guy who dreams of nothing more than launching himself into space in a car of his own invention (we've all been there). To do so, Terry explores the town of Sprankelwater, chatting with locals, getting into scrapes, catching bugs and collecting 'TURBO JUNK' to make his dreams a reality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Free from Vita jail.\nLike Nintendo’s own Wii U, the PS Vita has seen a good chunk of its best games migrate to alternative platforms in the years since the system itself veered into the realm of ‘commercial failure’. One of those games is Freedom Wars, a third-person action title created by Dimps that, at the time, was one of the most successful first-party-published Vita games (in Japan, at least). Now, over 10 years later, publisher Bandai Namco has taken the reins to present a remaster for Switch, retaining much of the original’s essence while improving upon the core gameplay.\nFreedom Wars Remastered is, at its core, a loose take on Monster Hunter’s gameplay. As a Sinner within an underground Panopticon city, you must complete combat ops. Y’see, in a world in which resources are exceptionally scarce, the very nature of existence is in itself a crime; hence, you begin the game with a rather harsh one million-year sentence. By completing operations and rescuing your fellow citizens from large creatures known as Abductors, you can reduce your sentence and gain entitlements along the way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The long-awaited remaster of the remake.\nWay back in 1989, Nihon Falcom released Ys III: Wanderers from Ys for various PC-based platforms and eventually consoles like the Genesis and SNES. This 2D side-scroller was well-respected in the community and eventually acted as the basis for 2005's 3D reimagining, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, though this didn’t receive a Western release until a PSP version in 2010. Now, hot off the recent Western release of Ys X: Nordics, Falcom brings this remake to modern platforms as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana. Sporting a few quality-of-life updates, this throwback to simpler times (which debuted in Japan back in September 2023) offers up an enjoyable and tightly designed action-RPG experience that you shouldn't miss out on.\nYs Memoire: The Oath in Felghana covers one of the earlier adventures of series star Adol Christin, following a journey to longtime companion Dogi's homeland of Felghana. They arrive and are warmly welcomed by Dogi’s friends and family, but it doesn’t take long for Adol to get caught up in a larger struggle. The king of Felghana seeks to claim a series of statues to loosen the seal placed upon a demon he wishes to release. Adol thus sets out to retrieve these statues before the king can, hoping to stop his nefarious plan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.\nRead more",

It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.\nThe problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case.

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.\n Read more",

It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. \"Want to discuss their alibi?

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified.

Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.\nRead more",

The project is called \"Artemis\" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless \"full of confidence\".\nRead more",

Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as \"Ghost Of A Tail\" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring's Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day. \r\n \nRead more",

This team will directly add to the pool of Team 1 cards that have been in packs since January 3. EA Sports has obviously stayed tight-lipped about the cards coming to the second team.\n\n\nThankfully, we have already seen a few cards that have been leaked on social media.\n\n\nAll NumeroFUT Team 2 players in EA FC 25 (Leaks)\n\n\nIf you believe the rumors, Team 2 will have cards from three positions: LB, RM, and GK. We have already received plenty of special cards from the NumeroFUT promo over the last week, and the following items are going to be added very soon to packs.\n\n\n\nEder Militao LB 91\n\n\nGriezmann RM 92\n\n\nBalde LB 90\n\n\nYan Couto\n\n\nGabriel Martinelli\n\n\nKyle Walker\n\n\nCuadrado RM 90\n\n\n\nI am pretty sure we will get more leaks as we get closer to the release on Friday, January 10. Team 2 is also reportedly going to have a mini-release, which is likely going to be added on January 11 or January 12. Do remember that the NumeroFUT cards are in packs till Tuesday, January 14, till the TOTY warm-up begins. This is based on the official event calendar as revealed by EA Sports at the start of the NumeroFUT promo.\n\n\nIf you want to maximize your chances of packing a promo item, you should wait till tomorrow when Team 2 of the NumeroFUT promo players are added to the packs. Some of the upcoming items are expected to be released as part of SBCs as well, so make sure to be on the lookout for them.

That's exactly what a sauna is for and, in games, they work exactly like in real life.

You have to turn up the temperature and use cold water to make the room more humid. The first thing we recommend is starting to work on the sauna quite a bit before you plan to relax in it.

Fast forward to today, over a decade later, and developer Dimps and publisher Bandai Namco have brought the action RPG to the modern console and PC market in the form of Freedom Wars Remastered.\n\n\nWhen it comes to giving a title the remastered treatment, Freedom Wars may just be the ideal candidate. Even though over 700,000 copies of the original were sold, being exclusive to a handheld console still meant many never gave it a try, even if it seemed right up their alley. It's a game that even in over a decade ago I felt it could potentially feel and play even better on a console, so it's great to finally have that opportunity.…",

GRAVELORD is set to kick off its Early Access period of \"unfiltered, hardcore carnage\" on January 22. \n\n\nDeveloper Fatbot Games has a nice little chunk of content lined up for Early Access. A full episode with eight levels will be available, along with a replayable bonus level. There are also plans for an integrated level editor, but it sounds like we'll have to wait for the full release to try out our own designs.\n\n\nFor a quickfire taste of Quake-style action with a side of mouthy protagonist, check out the short but action-packed release date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nFatbot is going all in on the boomer shooter distinction (and the \"let's put the fun back in funeral\" tagline). GRAVELORD looks appropriately fast-paced, with secret-filled levels giving players something to chew on when they aren't blowing enemies away in rapid succession.\n\n\nOn top of the traditional FPS gameplay, GRAVELORD has collectible Tarot Cards that can boost combat options and power, as well as upgradeable weapons with varying modes of fire. I'm less enthused about the \"badass protagonist,\" Queedo the Gravedigger. Queedo is billed as being \"dumb as hell but strong as an ox,\" which is a great asset to have in a game like this. He also \"has opinions\" and comments on what's happening on-screen with his Cockney accent. Let's hope it ends up being funny without the need for any pejorative air quotes. \n\n\nIf you can't wait until later this month, you can see more of what GRAVELORD is all about in the demo that's live now on Steam.\n\nThe post Boomer shooter GRAVELORD races into Early Access on January 22 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
