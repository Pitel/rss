          "description": "\"We will send unto them... only you\".\nChess is one of the most ancient games in existence, and while we continue to eagerly await the fabled release of the completely real Chess 2, it can be fun to see how modern game makers choose to iterate on the classic design. In Shotgun King, the latest release from Headbang Club and developer Punkcake Délicieux, we get a chance to see what a game of chess would be like if it had roguelike elements and you could shoot pieces with a shotgun. It’s ridiculous, shockingly difficult, and incredibly addictive once you understand it, making for a great experience all around.\nThe narrative in Shotgun King is kept pretty simple; you play as the evil Black King whose wicked and tyrannical ways have driven all of his once-loyal followers to desert him and join the White King’s army. Wounded by their betrayal and unwilling to own up to his mistakes, the king chooses to retrieve his trusty old shotgun for some good old-fashioned revenge, blowing away any pieces that stand in his way as he makes his last play for the White King’s head. It’s silly and the story hardly features beyond this basic premise, but we nonetheless appreciated the little cutscenes included to build up this little lore.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This \"extremely difficult\" decision will also apparently \"preserve the health of the studio\" and allow it to focus more on what it does best: \"create exceptional story-driven single-player experiences filled with vast worlds and rich characters.\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Main character Mush is trying to become the 'Dome-King' and, in order to prepare for this job interview, uses their experience in monster-collecting to view the world through the lens of this beloved RPG.

I like the way it eschews the sometimes slow, methodical pace of other extraction shooters in favour of a faster-paced team deathmatch.

Right at the start, as the camera pans down from the retrofuturist reception area to your lowly desk-based workstation, we see all manner of orange tubes, future Grady cores being trained to fool captcha image tests, a giant chicken, and what appears to be the origin point of Half-Life's ammo boxes being constructed. But there's also a pointed shot between the floorboards, showing us a pair of green praying mantises fumbling around over some electrical wiring and a rogue lightbulb. \nOn its own, this mantis scene is no stranger than anything else we've witnessed in the last 30 seconds. But as your journey through Aperture goes on, things start getting really weird, really fast. Over the course of the next half hour, we'll see these mantises discover electricity, evolve into a society of tiny house-dwelling insects with their own carriages and courtship dances, and eventually a futuristic civilization who have mastered flying saucers and created an eternally self-sustaining power source. All in the same time it takes your supervisor core Grady to come up with a rudimentary prototype for what will eventually go on to become Portal's creepy turret. But you, yes you, CHARLIE, had to go and ruin it all by dropping the giant metal head of corporate mega-bastard Cave Johnson through the floorboards. What might those mantises have become, if they hadn't been so rudely crushed by your rampant disregard for their wellbeing? \nRead more",

Created by Shenzen-based TiMI Studios, who have now acquired the IP from THQ Nordic, the new Delta Force will be a free-to-play military-realist PvP shooter set on destructible maps featuring driveable vehicles and aircraft, with dynamic weather and a variety of enemy factions and classes. It'll launch in 2024 across PC, consoles and mobile, and will support crossplay.\r\n\n\r\nThe original Delta Force launched in 1998, which was a busy year for videogames: it saw the release of Half-Life, Starcraft, Thief: The Dark Project, Baldur's Gate, Fallout 2 and Grim Fandango, together with Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid on the console side. I'm not sure Delta Force can hold a candle to any of those, but it had a decent critical reception and attracted enough fans to spawn a fairly staggering number of sequels. It stands apart in my memory mostly for its huge draw distances and its corresponding emphasis on long-distance firefights. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you can't wait for Path Of Exile 2, and you've long since lost interest in Diablo 4, then you might want to cast your loot-hungry eyes toward Last Epoch, an upcoming time-travel fantasy ARPG that's been enjoying a successful stint in early access since 2019 and, as tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show revealed, is on track for a full release later this year. The Geoffcom mega show also revealed there's a new mage class called the Runemaster heading to the game next month that's capable of casting 40 different spells on a single attack key, but given this is the first time we've written about Last Epoch, I realise that probably won't mean much to a lot of you. So let's back up a bit and introduce Last Epoch properly, because hoo boy, if you love customisable skill trees, this is the ARPG for you, my friend.\nRead more",

Announced at tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, Frontier Developments also showed off the game's new single-player Conquest mode, a procedurally generated series of challenges that will pit players against increasingly unpredictable combat scenarios, as well as its third playable faction: the wraith-like Nighthaunt. They'll be going up against the Stormcast Eternals alongside the Orruk Kruleboyz in the game's campaign, and I got to see them in action ahead of tonight's showcase. And I can confirm: they're a nasty bunch of spectral rags, this lot, especially when they pile on in large numbers.\nRead more",

But during tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, we got our first proper look at this demonic alien faction, as well as three of the units that will be at our disposal on release. And sure, the worker Imp and its long ears will no doubt appease the Grogu fans out there, but my personal highlight is the creepy flesh monster, the Brute. It looks rightly horrific, with its pair of grinning maws and glistening, pale skin, but at the tap of a key, it will rip itself down the middle in a mess of blood and gore so that two Fiends can burst forth Alien-style to continue the assault. It's kinda gross, but also weirdly rad? In any case, I'm into it.\nRead more",

This combination proved popular, and today there's a deal on the modern successor to the 27GL850 - the 27GP850. \nThe 27GP850 is down to $299.99 at Amazon, versus an original price of $429.99. We saw a lot of sales on the 1440p 144Hz 27GL850 when it reached this price, so seeing an even better 1440p 180Hz model at the same point could result in quite a popular pickup. \nRead more",

Sure it also has action-RPG elements, but also is a story-rich visual novel and sports game? And they not only work together but also compliment each other?? It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).\nThe rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.\nRead more",

DLSS will also be on hand to absorb the inevitably mahoosive performance hit from bouncing all those rays around, and that includes DLSS 3, provided you have a compatible graphics card.\nIt’s being developed by a collective of experienced HL2 modders, Orbifold Studios, without direct input from Valve. No release date yet, as Half-Life 2 RTX – or to use its full name, Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project – is still in the early stages. There is a teaser trailer, though.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone whose auto-battler experience has, up until now, only been limited to minor forays into the excellent Alice0-recommended Super Auto Pets, sitting down to play a run of Tales & Tactics was somewhat overwhelming. Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. \nIt's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.\nRead more",

After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.\nIndeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.\nRead more",

Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.\nDespite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.\nRead more",

Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.\nI think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.\nDon't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.\n Read more",

          "description": "Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. \r\n\n\r\n“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.\r\n\n\r\nThe update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.\r\n \nRead more",

These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.\nIt's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways.

          "description": "If someone were to write the history of internet video, I think they'd need to mention Killer Bean. Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.\r\n\nNow it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There's a first trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday's musings about pacifism - but I've mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.\n  \nRead more",

Larian's epic RPG had people asking: why aren't all games like this? But in an angry tone of voice that we feel left some things out of the conversation. Also, Nate challenges a Times columnist to single MMA combat, and we talk about the games we've been playing this week (spoilers: none of them are Baldur's Gate 3!).\nRead more",

I wasn't expecting a slight stir about the inability to complete the game without killing anyone. \"Disappointing\", responded Youtuber Mike BurnFire in the QTs. Opined Mama Bedlam: \"A fully pacifist run not existing (without mods) is a genuinely worrying sign to do with the flexibility of what the game can do\". Some players took the news as a brazen provocation. As ManyATrueNerd put it: \"CHALLENGE. FUCKING. ACCEPTED.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

They do form a pleasant contrast, in fairness. Both are space games but one doesn't have a fishing mechanic, whereas the other is all fishing mechanic. One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid. The Anglerfish Project deserves better than to serve only as a counterpoint for the Bethesda colossus, however - it's a sweet and tidy stargaze 'em up with a dry sense of humour, and you can download it for free on Itch.io.\nRead more",

Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme's upcoming turn-based tactics 'em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I've been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.\nSpecifically, I've been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League's campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I'm not gonna lie. I've had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I'd arrived fresh and green, I don't think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is. \nRead more",

          "description": "Forget Starfield. Let's play something more old school instead. How about The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind? That's a classic Bethesda title, and it's still having mods made for it. But if you want a mix of the two, then we've got you covered on that front.\nBefore you take to the skies in Starfield, feel free to check out AnyOldName3's contribution to the current trend. Over on Nexus Mods, you'll find a small download for Morrowind that implements the contentious Starfield main menu screen.\n[caption id=\"attachment_398649\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via AnyOldName3/Nexus Mods.[/caption]\nThat's right, the Starfield menu that has caused an uproar can be a part of one of the best role-playing games of a bygone era. And all before Bethesda's new sci-fi game even hits the shelves.\nShitpost modding is still modding\nAnyOldName3's mod is a simple affair, replacing Morrowind's menu screen with Starfield's. If you do want to download it (just for shits and giggles, I guess), you will need OpenMW, as it only works though that.\nThat's basically all this mod does. As far as we can tell, it's still the same old Elder Scrolls 3. If you want to fundamentally improve or alter Morrowind in any way that's gameplay worthy, there are mods galore for that sort of thing.\nAs for Starfield, we are inching ever closer to its release date. By now, you've probably heard just about everything there is to know about Bethesda's brand-new IP. But in case you've forgotten, the game will be releasing on September 6 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Starfield’s contentious main menu screen comes to Morrowind appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We'll probably never see a third installment in Valve's legendary Left 4 Dead series, but that's okay. L4D2 is still getting a lot of love and, in fact, it recently received a small update that comes packed with tweaks, as well as one sought-after change.\nAs spotted by PC Gamer, the patch notes for the latest update to Left 4 Dead 2 notes that, among other things, Valve has finally decided to name the Swamp Fever gator, something that's apparently been requested by the community. From this day forth, the \"swamp gator\" shall canonically be known as...Fred. Do with this info as you must.\n[caption id=\"attachment_398633\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Valve/Steam.[/caption]\nAccording to my own Steam account, this patch is only a 2MB download, but as you can see from the notes, there's a laundry list of tinkering that's gone on.\nStill rockin' the Steam charts\nAnd why shouldn't the developer keep its 14-year-old zombie co-op game alive and well? It's an absolute classic in the genre, giving more of what people loved in the original release. It's still going pretty strong overall. At the time of writing, SteamDB registers almost 27,000 players fightin' hordes in Left 4 Dead 2 right now. Also, the game is currently at the number 44 spot on the Steam charts.\nThat might not sound impressive, but considering Elden Ring is just ahead at 40 and Cyberpunk 2077 is trailing behind at position 48, Valve's classic FPS is still managing to pull in enough players. Although we were supposed to be seeing a return to the L4D format with Turtle Rock Studios' Back 4 Blood, it didn't quite hit the mark. For many, it was a decent zombie shooter, but it just couldn't reach the heights of Valve's long-dormant series.\nThe post Left 4 Dead 2 update finally names Swamp Fever gator, because why not appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Video game and general graphical technology is advancing so fast, that it's tough to keep up with it. Now, Nvidia has announced that the latest version of its Deep Learning Super Sampling (or DLSS) is on the way, and it's already going to support some modern titles.\nDetails can be found on Nvidia's website. The long and the short of it is: DLSS 3.5 is due to release sometime this fall. It represents the next stage in Team Green's upscaling AI tech, with a recent video from the company explaining just how it's better than previous iterations.\nhttps://youtu.be/sGKCrcNsVzo\nOn top of that, games like Alan Wake 2 and Portal RTX will support version 3.5, as will the upcoming Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077.\nOne for you graphical purists\nThe recent video announcing DLSS 3.5 gives an overview of how the people at Nvidia have improved the image upscaling algorithm. Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research, says this latest version will feature Ray Reconstruction.\nHow does it work? Catanzaro gives some insight into how it differs from the ray tracing technology many of us have come to be familiar with. Suffice it to say, most casual gamers probably won't be too concerned with the details. However, side-by-side comparisons showing Cyberpunk with all the iterations of DLSS (including 3.5) do show a difference in quality, especially when it comes to bolder colors in light reflections.\nAs always, the upcoming Nvidia AI will only be compatible with RTX-enabled graphics cards. Bit of a shame that it's not more open source, but no doubt AMD (and possibly Intel) will follow closely with newer and more powerful versions of their own upscaling alternatives.\nThe post Nvidia announces DLSS 3.5, will support Cyberpunk DLC and Alan Wake 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It appears that all is not well at the studio, as on August 23, it announced that it is \"eliminating approximately 50 roles.\"\nAccording to a statement released by general manager Gary McKay, the move was made to help BioWare become a \"more agile and more focused studio.\" McKay states that this is an unavoidable outcome, and steps will be taken to \"ensure the process is handled with empathy, respect, and clear communication.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_398647\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bioware.[/caption]\nWhat's going on at BioWare?\nAccording to McKay, BioWare's long-term vision is to deliver \"exceptional story-driven single-player experiences filled with vast worlds and rich characters.\" This involves ensuring that the upcoming Dragon Age and Mass Effect games are a success. The announcement reveals that the studio's dedication to Dragon Age: Dreadwolf hasn't wavered, and that a team led by Mike Gamble is still working on the next Mass Effect game.\nEmployees affected by the layoffs won't be left stranded, according to McKay who promises to provide \"impacted colleagues with as many internal opportunities as possible,\" though he does state that it is unlikely that everyone will find new internal roles. With several roles opening up in Electronic Arts' other studios, affected workers will also be assisted with their applications for these positions.\nThis is unfortunate news, though BioWare isn't the only studio that has suffered layoffs this year. The AR gaming studio Niantic has also met the same fate, as well as CD Projekt Red and  The Callisto Protocol's Striking Distance, to name a few.\nThe post BioWare hit with layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

It looks like a tacky game that followed in the wake of Mortal Kombat. In fact, it would fit right in alongside titles that pushed the limits of tastefulness back in the ‘90s. It’s hypnotic.\nIn my experience, a well-executed aesthetic can be indicative not necessarily of a game’s quality, but of its inventiveness. Not always, but sometimes. My favorite type of game is one where the developers fucked around and found out. However, that methodology doesn’t always result in an appealing game.\nDraft of Darkness is so well-executed in its mechanics that it makes them seem accidental.

Announced back in June 2022, this one is going for a survival twist as players create their own Dwarf before venturing into the treacherous mines. Players will have to craft superior armor and weapons to tough out the challenges that await in the dark and foreboding locale. Your ultimate goal involves recovering treasures and restoring the mines to their former glory, if you can make it out alive.  \nThankfully, there's at least a little bit of safety in numbers. While you can play Return to Moria solo, there's an online multiplayer component that sounds like the main attraction here. It was also previously confirmed that Tolkien scholar Corey Olsen — AKA The Tolkien Professor — is onboard as a consultant.

With the clash between the two primordial forces officially coming to a close and/or cooling off into a state of equilibrium, some Destiny fans may have expected Bungie to go all-out with a new elemental subclass, a new race of enemies to fight, and more. That, however, isn't happening for the most part.\nBungie was never going to meet all of its community's expectations, naturally, but there's a non-insignificant number of very whelmed and indifferent responses to the latest Destiny 2 showcase on the game's subreddit.…",

And by gosh, it doesn’t look like it would fit in my living room.\nOkay, so before you get too excited, the Starfield x TEMPUR chair isn’t for purchase. It’s one-of-a-kind, and I guess it’s just designed as a way to sell Starfield to butts. It’s going to be at Gamescom 2023, and then it will travel to the “Saturn Xperion store in Germany, before enjoying a month-long residency at the TEMPUR store in Westfield, Stratford.” You’ll need to travel to one of these locations if you want your butt to experience this amazing chair.\nThe press release goes into a lot of boring information that would probably only interest butts. It’s designed after NASA’s typical space chairs and has a joystick on each armrest (arcade style, for some reason). It swivels, so while it looks like one of those step-in chairs that pull forward, you can just turn it and sit down. That’s pretty cowardly.\nI could maybe do without the giant desk, but I would totally be down for a space chair. Gamer chairs these days all look like they were pulled from a sports car, but I want one that goes beyond that. If my apartment suddenly launches skyward, I want to be prepared.\nUnfortunately, I can’t buy the Starfield x TEMPUR chair, but I can win it. Before the end of the year, there’s going to be a charity raffle. That’s all the information I have on that, so you’ll need to keep your eyes peeled and your butt prepared.\nThe post The Starfield x TEMPUR Dream Chair looks like an expensive thing to put your butt on appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, if you just want the game to look prettier, you can soon run it through Nvidia's RTX Remix tech.\nOver on the Nvidia GeForce YouTube channel, you can see a teaser for a revamped version of the iconic Half-Life 2. Side-by-side comparisons show what the OG release looks like when compared to the upcoming remastered version.\nhttps://youtu.be/aM_gzfAMdNs\nThe Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project actually comes to us via the modding community itself. The description under the trailer says it's being helmed by \"four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now known as Orbifold Studios.\" Currently, there doesn't appear to be a release date for it.\nOoh, it's so shiny!\nThe original Half-Life 2 (now fast approaching its 19th birthday) still holds up today. However, a \"remixed\" version of the classic FPS could bring a visual boost that could breathe new life into it.\nThe fan-made project will boast full ray tracing for that added dose of lighting goodness, DLSS 3 for graphical upscaling, and a bunch of other tech things that sound fancy.\nNvidia released its RTX Remix as a way for modders to give that certain je ne sais quoi to games that support such modern visual technologies. However, we've also seen it been used to pretty up even older games, like the original Tomb Raider.\nYou can check out more details on the upcoming Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project by going to Nvidia's website.\nThe post Half-Life 2 will look shiny thanks to RTX Remix appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was enamored by the cover the enticing giant mech on it; and kept it close while I experienced a whole slate of robot-based oddities like G-Nome, and Heavy Gear.

The joy of treasure hunting, discovering new areas, and taking breaks to hang out at the home base (or go on Castle Defense-esque night missions) was too enticing: and now its existence has spawned a real-life treasure hunter.\nA self-described \"clay artist with a love of Pikmin,\" Twitter user ZatchMehr is trying to eventually locate and acquire every in-game Pikmin 4 treasure in real life. They've noted that they started their quest roughly three days after the game came out, and it's taken them about a month to get this far.\nIf you're curious, they've even been chronicling their journey with tweets of individual collections, in a near 1:1 recreation of the in-game collection screenshots:\nRecreation Collection\nHands of Fate\nThe Rescue Command Post tutorial\nNewly Nostalgic\nAs a reminder Pikmin 4 has 239 treasures (that are uniquely designed): so there's still a ways to go.\nhttps://twitter.com/ZatchMehr/status/1694121307129127421\nHow many treasures do you have?\nIn terms of the electronic stuff, I own that exact Wavebird, the small Game and Watch portable, the GameCube Wave Race disc, the SNES mouse, the red/blue Switch Joy-Con set, and that blue GBA SP.

We've already had revamped versions of the first two Quake games, and now the developer is bringing back Star Wars: Dark Forces.\nIn a recent trailer on the studio's YouTube channel, Nightdive will be collaborating with Lucasfilm Games (formerly LucasArts) to create a remaster of the mid-90's Star Wars title.\nhttps://youtu.be/4b9TTurkH4c\nThe trailer (which demonstrates alpha footage) shows off some of the work so far. You'll definitely want to check out the renewed cut scenes. Much like previous projects done by Nightdive, it'll still look and feel like Dark Forces, but will be given a modern lift with 4K visuals, plus \"advanced 3D rendering, modern gamepad support, trophies and achievements, and more.\"\nThe (dark) force is strong in this one\nThe original game was released all the way back in 1995, and was the first in the Jedi Knight series. It was developed on the aptly named Jedi engine, which is a toolkit that shares similarities with Build, the engine that powered the likes of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior. Nightdive's remaster of the ancient Star Wars game will utilize the KEX engine instead, which the studio has used in a number of projects, including for the Quake remaster.\nWe recently got treated to a modern version of Quake 2, which improved the graphics (particularly in the lighting department) while also adding quality-of-life changes and the DLC.\nAt the moment, we don't know when Star Wars: Dark Forces will be coming out, but it's set to release on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\nThe post Star Wars: Dark Forces is getting remastered, by Nightdive no less appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nightdive Studios has announced that the N64 version of Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion will be among the next games to get the remaster treatment. Not only that, it already has a release date of November 14 and is coming to PC and consoles.\nOriginally released in 2000, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion was an interesting turn for Acclaim’s Turok series. It really shows the awkward evolution of the first-person shooter genre in the wake of 1998’s Half-Life. While the first two games were largely just fast-paced key-hunting games like early FPS, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion incorporated more story elements and cutscenes. It involved two would-be Turoks trying to fight back against an encroaching threat in the wake of Joshua Fireseed’s apparent death.\nhttps://youtu.be/SdCaj5ZRp-A\nIt’s the last numbered Turok entry and, really, the last good one. The level design kind of gets mired in the muddy brown industrial look of the late ‘90s, and the action isn’t as swift as the earlier titles. A lot of the real Turok identity gets lost in the pursuit of gaming trends. Despite that, it’s an interesting early-3D game.\nWhile Nightdive previously remastered the first two Turok games, a rerelease of Shadow of Oblivion wasn’t guaranteed. The first two titles already had PC ports that the studio could work off of, whereas Turok 3 never left the N64. However, since they were able to “reverse engineer” and provide the N64 campaign of Quake 2, I had hoped that they put in the effort because they were working on a port to Turok 3. And sure enough…\nDoes this mean we'll get Turok: Rage Wars someday?\nTurok 3: Shadow of Oblivion is getting the KEX Engine treatment. Nightdive is boasting a lot of the same enhancements that the Quake 2 remaster received, including real-time lighting and updated models.

It has brought countless new players to the genre, many of whom likely got absolutely hooked and have already done everything there is to do in the game — despite that likely requiring up to 200 hours of playtime. If you're one of these heroes, maybe you could find some use in a list of masterpieces of old and new that capture the same magic as 2023's biggest game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397148\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image by Interplay[/caption]\nPlanescape Torment (1999)\nThough it features a great mix of combat, enemies, and magic spells, what set Planescape Torment apart was its focus on story and character development.

          "description": "During Gamescom Opening Night Live we got to see the first official gameplay trailer for Crimson Desert. It's no surprise, but the gameplay looks like a revamped and enhanced version of the combat from Black Desert Online.\nThe war-torn and medieval fantasy world of Pywel looks absolutely beautiful, and I can't wait to explore it. Not to mention about halfway through the trailer we get to see some quality fishing gameplay. Why can't every game have fishing? In the video the player caught a nice sized Barracuda that looked like it could be consumed to replenish 150 HP.\nDespite how beautiful and honestly polished the open-world action-adventure title looked, there was no release date or timeframe.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdmoGYg8tB0\nWe first saw Crimson Desert during the 2020 Game Awards. It's been in development for quite some time now by developer Pearl Abyss, creator of Black Desert Online. It was originally announced as an MMORPG but by the end of 2020 Pearl Abyss announced that was no longer the case. Instead, Crimson Desert will intertwine a single-player and multiplayer experience.\nDespite its many flaws—and abhorrent pay-to-win mechanics,—Black Desert Online has one of the best combat systems ever in an MMORPG. Seeing Crimson Desert utilize an even more enhanced version of the combat system has me excited to try it out.\nThere is no release date yet for Crimson Desert, but we do know it is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Crimson Desert shows off beautiful world and even fishing, but still no release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

It wasn’t anything glamorous, but I got the opportunity during one of the lowest points in my life. COVID was in full swing, and I had lost my job. It helped me hold onto a shred of self-worth for a while. I faded off shortly after, but I enjoyed the time I spent collaborating with them.\nI didn’t work on WrestleQuest, though. The closest I came was when I was asked if it looked like one of the crowd members was flipping the middle finger.

          "description": "During Gamescom 2023, Blizzard revealed Season 2 for Diablo 4: Season of Blood. It looks like Blizzard will be following the originally promised quarterly release schedule for Diablo 4 seasons. Season of Blood will release on October 17, almost exactly three months after Season of the Malignant.\nAfter a pretty lackluster Season 1, hopefully Season of Blood adds more meaningful content, especially in the end-game of Diablo 4.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF65c670lpM\nThe announcement trailer didn't give us much information, other than that we'll be accompanying a new character named Erys. Erys is voiced by actress and producer Gemma Chan and leads the effort against a deadly new evil in Sanctuary. Based on the trailer, the new evil seems to be some blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures with extremely pointy teeth.\nAt the end of the trailer, we get a few quick glimpses of new features coming in Season of Blood. A new questline, new vampiric powers—which will probably replace the existing malignant hearts—and five new endgame bosses. Honestly, the endgame bosses could be pretty exciting, as that's currently a lacking feature of Diablo 4 compared to other ARPGs like Path of Exile.\nAlso, it appears we'll be getting updates to renown rewards, gem and stash storage, and resistances and status effects. Without concrete details it's hard to know how exactly to feel. But, all of these sound like good things, so I'm excited to find out more.\nDiablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, will release on all platforms on October 17.\nThe post Diablo 4 Season 2 is Season of Blood, starts October 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The perk system is getting overhauled, new weapons and vehicles are being added, and a number of systems and mechanics are getting brushed up. Not all of it looks completely revolutionary, but they did give a peak at the upgraded police system and showed off vehicular weaponry. Both of which I think will definitely improve the moments between narrative.\nhttps://youtu.be/zBrkG3aeWCc\nThey're also finally implementing a Relic upgrade screen. It was viewable on the base game, but for whatever reason, it wasn't implemented. When I played through, I was saving upgrade points for when it would eventually unlock, but I got impatient and looked it up and found out that there wasn't a talent tree for it. What a tease.\nThere are a few other bullet points that sound interesting, including an increased level cap, upgraded combat AI, and redesigned cyberware. I'm hoping that you can now have more visible cyberware, but I'm not holding my breath. I thought Cyberpunk 2077 was a bit up its own ass when it came to showing off its production values, but I'm still looking forward to the expansion.\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion releases on September 26, 2023.

The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.\nThe free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator.

However, it stopped short of revealing its name or a price. Today, PlayStation has revealed it’s called the PlayStation Portal and will cost $199.99 when it’s released later this year.\n\nThe PlayStation Portal remote player includes the features you’d expect from a DualSense controller like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But wedged between the two controller halves is an 8-inch LCD screen capable of 1080p/60FPS playback. PlayStation says the device is “for gamers in households where they might need to share their living room TV or simply want to play PS5 games in another room of the house.” \nThe PlayStation Portal will connect remotely to your PS5 over Wi-FI, and can play supported games installed on your console. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack for wired audio, although the new PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore earbuds will connect to it wirelessly via new technology the company is calling PlayStation Link. You can read more about these two new audio devices here. \n\nPSVR2 games, which require the headset, and games streamed through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud streaming are not supported, however. \nPlayStation Portal will launch later this year for $199.99. There’s no release date yet for the device, but PlayStation says it will have more details soon on when preorders begin.",

These are player-directed missions, letting players engage how they want.\nYou can play stealthy with appropriate gear, go loud, use vehicles, tacticals, and even use killstreaks in campaigns. They work seamlessly with cinematic moments, with the idea being that players have increased agency and flexibility in how they choose to tackle story missions. \nSimilar to last year’s Modern Warfare 2 gameplay reveal, we see a squad infiltrate a deep-sea vessel during a violent storm. After making their way into a base situated within an old fort, they proceed underground into a facility, blasting foes along the way. Though it's hard to get a sense of the Open Combat Missions in this demo, the video provides a nice look at MWIII's impressive visuals. \n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III launches on November 10.",

It also highlights various other areas in this sprawling open world, NPCs, and more. And, of course, it features a healthy dose of the game’s hand-to-hand combat and wrestling-inspired moves. \nCheck out the Crimson Desert gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we also see some of the game's traversal, including skydiving, Kliff climbing up buildings and trees, and more. We also see some minigames featured in Crimson Desert, like fishing, arm-wrestling, and the one that occurs when trying to tame wild horses. \n“Developed on Pearl Abyss’ proprietary next-generation ‘BlackSpace Engine,’ Crimson Desert is an open world action-adventure game,” a press release reads. “With an engaging setting and realistic characters, Crimson Desert depicts the story of mercenaries fighting for survival on the expansive continent of Pywel.” \n\nPearl Abyss says it aims for a simultaneous global release of Crimson Desert on PC and console. While the studio’s CEO, Jin-Young Heo, stated earlier this year the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window, there’s still no word on when to expect it to launch. \nFor more about the game, check out the Crimson Desert gameplay debut trailer and then find out why it’s on our list of the top 10 upcoming action games.\nAre you excited about Crimson Desert?

The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. \nAtari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. \n\n\nThe 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:\nAdventure\nCombat\nDodge ‘Em\nHaunted House\nMaze Craze\nMissle Command\nRealsports Volleyball\nSurround\nVideo Pinball\nYar’s Revenge\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\nThe Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.",

Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: \n\n\nIn The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.\n“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.\nStarward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” \n\nThe Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here. \nThe Invincible hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. \nAre you going to check out The Invincible later this year?

Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies & TV app will stop working altogether.\nHowever, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you'll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.\nAdditionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn't encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform's most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today's announcement post. Here's the most recent batch from November 2021:\nFor more Xbox 360 nostalgia, you can revisit our top 25 Xbox 360 games of all time.\nAre there any Xbox 360 games you'll be rushing to grab before the store closes?

Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. \nAlan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. \nAlan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.",

So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...",

Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.\n\n\nDimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character. \nTo learn more about why we think TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is the best Turtles game in decades, read our review here.",
