It has controllers that you can detach from the screen. You can plug it into your TV to make (you guessed it) a bigger screen. It was revolutionary.\nNow, there are a couple of other devices on the market that offer a similar experience. We have previously looked at the Aya Neo Air over on our sister site, Time Extension, and we have even weighed up the pros and cons of the Steam Deck right here on Nintendo Life.

Molly Medusa: Queen of Spit starts with a fun concept but it strains against its own ambition in almost every direction.\nComing from Neckbolt, the solo developer of Yono And The Celestial Elephants, first impressions mean a lot and the first few moments you spend in the game have plenty of charm. Molinike – Molly for short – is an apprentice sculptor whose teacher sends her out for a new chisel so he can finish his current piece. Molly, like many young artists, wants to make great art right now without learning the essential tools of the trade.

          "description": "It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. \r\n\n\r\nWhat I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. \nThere's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.\nRead more",

But look, if the park works, it works, right? The shareholders can't complain!\nThing is, much like with the internet or your mum's relationship with the binman, theme park simulators can really change while you're not paying attention. While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?\" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   \r\n\n\r\nBeginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. \"We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,\" he says. \"The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.\"  \r\n\n \nRead more",

When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being \"point designers\" for certain characters. \"Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,\" Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. \nBoth are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design 'style' that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being \"bombastic\".\nRead more",

As we continue our scientific process, this week I ask you to choose between two things which combine help and hurt. What's better: heals harming the undead, or voice chat?\nRead more",

It's the first project to hatch from Bohemia's incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.\nSilica is largely the work of one developer, Martin \"Dram\" Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia's Take On Mars.

The four men, seated on tall Hollywood director’s chairs, were estimated to be worth a combined $11 billion - and that was in 1995 money.\r\n\n\r\nTogether, Dreamworks and Microsoft were going 50-50 on a new game studio, investing a total of $30 million. “I’m spoiled,” said Spielberg, as recorded by the LA Times. “I worked with the best studios and the best actors, and it would be silly to get into the interactive business without Microsoft. They’re the best company in the world. It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.” It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. \n\"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie,\" he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals \"we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.\"\nRead more",

How would a game built for up to four players cope when there's just one person taking the reins? Well, sort of fine for a bit, then quite agonising, actually.

I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.\nIn case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate. \nRead more",

          "description": "Hargh blargh games are bad, roguelikes are worse, whinge moan complain. It is that time once again. You know whether my complaints will bother you, so consider this a massive recommendation if they dont: Shardtide Verminp... Punktide Verminsha... Shardpunk... goddamn it. Hang on.\nShardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn't feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn't also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and \"repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum\" though, I can't pretend I don't enjoy it anyway.\nRead more",

          "description": "Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam's desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad. \nRead more",

Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Why am I so slow”, complains my partner, minutes into being cajoled into playing Dota 2 for the very first time. “Ah, you’ll need to buy boots,” I say, with the hard earned wisdom of someone who’s spent over 4,000 hours clicking on wizards. “I have boots,” she says, somewhat indignantly. “Those are slippers,” I reply. “What?” she asks, somewhat more indignantly. “They don’t give you move speed,” I respond. I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.\r\n\n\r\nA new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. \"It's surreal,\" he says. \"For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying.\"\nOn the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. \nSolomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently. \nRead more",

Survival is best served on the couch, curled up like a shrimp with the blood draining from my arms as I hold the TV slab at some atrocious angle.\nAnyway, I've come to realise that Vampire Survivors might be a game about running away, but actually peaks when you come to a standstill.

          "description": "Look as hot as The Nurse\nIn an interesting, but somewhat unnerving, piece of merchandising, Konami has announced that it will be teaming with make-up, erm, maker Vampyre Cosmetics in order to produce a line of cosmetic products based upon the Drop Dead Gorgeous world of *checks notes* Silent Hill.\nWhile absolutely no images or even hints were offered up as to what the line of items will include, the comical nature of a Silent Hill cosmetics line writes itself, given the series drab, grim, and disgusting look. Are you expecting a palette of rusted metals, fog greys, and rotted flesh reds? I kid, of course, but it will genuinely be interesting to see how the grisly, depressing world of Silent Hill is reproduced in a beauty line. Vampyre Cosmetics, as the name suggests, is pretty sharp at adapting the darker side of make-up, so I'm looking forward to seeing what is eventually produced.\nhttps://twitter.com/TeamSilentHill/status/1654521071326863360?s=20\nThis is, of course, a pretty big year for the missing-in-action survival horror franchise. As revealed during the Fall 2022 Silent Hill Transmission stream, there are currently multiple projects in production at Konami, including Christophe Gans’ live-action movie Return to Silent Hill, streaming series Silent Hill: Ascension, Annapurna spin-off Silent Hill: Townfall and, of course, Bloober Team's incoming remake of 2001 classic Silent Hill 2. So you can paint yourself up in the new line of Vampyre Cosmetics, and perhaps, if your make-up skills match mine, you can be the scariest thing in town.\nSilent Hill 2 is currently in development for PS5 and PC.\nThe post Silent Hill is teaming with Vampyre Cosmetics for new… make-up line? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Capitalism and Crypto breaks all\nThis weekend saw UDON Comics publish the first issue of Street Fighter 6, a new comic that acts as a prologue to the events of Capcom's upcoming sequel — Issue #1, which is available to download for free right here, follows the journey of Ken Masters, as he visits the worryingly militant district of Nayshall.\nKen is bringing his conglomerate, The Masters Foundation, to the recently founded nation in order to run a lucrative fighting tournament, working alongside the nation's sinister minister Johann Petrovich, known to most as simply \"JP\". Ken is not quite the man he used to be, however. Not only is he estranged from his wife, Eliza, but he is worrying the board of his foundation, having divulged company funds into unstable markets, such as cryptocurrency.\n\nMoreso, Ken has been neglecting his growing son, Mel, who in the issue has been offloaded on PMC cop and SF6 poster boy, Luke Sullivan. If all of this wasn't enough, Ken is quickly learning that Nayshall, the locale for his latest pipe dream, is hardly the free-est of states, plagued with violent revolution over its recent gentrification. This has brought anger to the nation's people — anger that Mr. Masters is set to face first-hand.\nThe first issue not only gives fans a little insight into the politics of Nayshall itself, but also introduces us to the frightening JP, gives us a little time with Luke, (I just don't like the dude), and sets the paving for the events that will lead to Ken's rough fall from grace. Yer boy is going to need some serious guidance, and soon. Hopefully, he'll eventually get it, perhaps delivered in the vessel of his dearest friend and rival.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.  Be sure to check out our recent report on a full build, the internet’s joy at Cammy’s new friend, and the 10 characters that I think who make a fine fit as post-launch DLC.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 prologue comic sees Ken Masters losing himself appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, it's been about six years between this week's launch of Tears of the Kingdom and its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. So, since it's such a special occasion — and Zelda is such a popular series here at Destructoid — We have decided to commemorate the season of the new with a look back at the old. Yes, it is Zelda Week!\nFor those unfamiliar with our past celebrations, we'll be posting and sharing lists, write-ups, and blogs all about the Zelda series this week, leading up to the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom this Friday, May 12. We'll have thoughtful looks at the history of the series. We'll have lists with contributions from a variety of staff members. And heck, we might even bump some old favorites from our previous Zelda Week festivities.\nSo let's don some green tunics and venture forth into the great unknown. It's Zelda Week, y'all!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ\nThe post Welcome to Zelda Week at Destructoid! appeared first on Destructoid.",

While this is exciting, the fact that EA now owns the developer and property sticks in my craw.\nWith EA’s money pushing development, the presentation is getting upgraded for the new generation. The presser states that “All-Star character models have been refreshed, lighting has been updated, game cameras and cutscene animations have been overhauled, and audio has expanded and improved throughout the game.”\nThey’re also touting the implementation of pro baseball players, which made me pause.

          "description": "It's in the blood\nWith Redfall, I keep going back to the beginning. In my review-in-progress from the start of this week, I opened with the game's introduction, because it paints quite the picture: a town overrun by vampires, some so powerful they can blot out the sun and freeze the oceans in place. It's a good horror set-up: you are the livestock, penned into the town of Redfall, and you will either fight or be food.\nIt's not too long after the introduction that I started to feel those drives fall by the wayside, though. There are pieces of Arkane Austin here, from immersive elements and storytelling to a generally interesting stylistic direction. But it all falters under the weight of bugs, repetition, locked-off doors, and a loop that didn't do much for me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch…",

Power took the points in each and every category — including Sneak Peek, Public Vote, Open Play, Pro Play, and Tricolor — though it should be noted that Wisdom and Courage both held their own in each category. It was a close call, despite Power's clean sweep.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1655396316925644801?s=20\nThis splatfest was, of course, held in order to promote the release of Nintendo's biggest game of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which launches later this week exclusively on Nintendo Switch. Splatoon has been used by Nintendo in the past to smartly cross-promote its other releases, such as Pokemon and Super Mario, and has, from time to time, teamed with other brands for special sponsored splatfests.\nThis latest victory continues to push Splatoon 3 host Shiver's lead, as she claims her fourth victory of seven total splatfests to date.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

And while its 18-strong launch roster is packed out with colorful design and charismatic personas, these World Warriors are truly brought to life thanks to the talented efforts of its (surprisingly large) voice cast.\nWhile the following list contains many veteran SF voice actors, such as Jessica Strauss, Caitlin Glass, Peter Beckman, and Kyle Herbert, we also welcome names that, while perhaps new to the world of Street Fighter, are already very notable in the general field of voice acting.

          "description": "Feeling Catty\nCapcom has quietly issued a brand new trademark for the unannounced title Monster Hunter Puzzles: Felyne Islands, suggesting that the Japan-only PSP release, Airu de Puzzle, may be getting dusted off for an all-new worldwide release. The trademark was filed with multiple international licensors.\nAs noted by Gematsu, Airu de Puzzle is a cute, block puzzle title that launched on PlayStation Portable (PSP) way back in 2012). The fun handheld title has players battle it out in typical block-busting action, championed by the adorable feline friends of the Monster Hunter franchise. The backstory sees the characters, (and even some of the monsters), of Airu village gather together for an exciting puzzle festival, which will also, conveniently, provide plenty of the mythical energy to bring prosperity back to the island.\nYou can check out the original trailer for the PSP release below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkjSRmqcnGU&ab_channel=CapcomChannel\nNow, to be clear, this is just hearsay, but the new title of Felyne Islands sure sounds like a localization of the 2012 release, unless Capcom is planning to build a brand-new title from scratch. Given the newfound love of Monster Hunter on a global scale, it would make sense that the developer might simply be mining its back catalog for timeless titles that would most certainly sell in 2023, perhaps when afforded just a little HD polish. Either way, we'll be sure to give you the heads-up when Felyne Isles is officially announced, in whatever form it eventually presents itself.\nCapcom trademarks Monster Hunter Puzzles: Felyne Isles worldwide [Gematsu]\nThe post Capcom files trademark for Monster Hunter Puzzles: Felyne Isles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Do the Wild Fang\nDraw your swords, pick up your spellbook, and take my axe, as this week's entry to the Arcade Archives sees Hamster treat us to Koei Tecmo's high-fantasy brawler Tecmo Knight, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to arcades in 1989, hot on the heels of Tecmo success Ninja Gaiden, Tecmo Knight, (known in Japan as Wild Fang), sees the titular, muscle-bound hero battle their way through the Kingdom of Valdik, on a quest to rescue the townspeople from the clutches of the terrifying Beast Demon Army, (Beasts? Demons? Nah, both). Tecmo Knight is ably assisted by his tiger pal, \"Tiger\", who absolutely isn't Cringer, and Smokeman, a deity who provides additional attacks and abilities.\nAdditionally, Tecmo Knight can call upon the power of a dragon, who can defeat any opponent with a single blast of fiery breath. Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Punch Pedia.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWHuuRt_lho&ab_channel=PunchPedia\nWhile Tecmo Knight at first glance appears to be Tecmo's take on Sega's own hit, Golden Axe, (and in many ways it is), Tecmo's offering is a little more finicky and precise in its controls, ala Ninja Gaiden, which makes it a trickier challenge and thus kept it from becoming a truly well-remembered classic.\nOh, and like Ninja Gaiden, it has an anxiety-inducing Continue? screen, which sees the Tecmo Knight being eaten by a giant monster as he screams in pain. Failing to add a credit in time sees a helmeted beast hack through the screen, yelling \"NO FUTURE!\" like a 1978 British punk. A famously violent attract sequence was also ultimately censored before release, with further bloodletting, (decapitations in particular), ensuing throughout the game.\nTecmo Knight is definitely worth checking out, though it certainly lacks the pace and energy of other brawlers of the day. It is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.\nThe post Fantasy scrapper Tecmo Knight charges the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Why Ganondorf looks so dehydrated and then gets re-hydrated, for example. Or what's up with all those islands in the sky. Plus, I would like to get some ideas for wacky contraptions to slap together with Link's new magical hand powers.\nHopefully, for the folks at home, the midnight release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will also include the digital version unlocking sometime around then too. Either way, it does look like we're ramping up into one of the year's big releases, with some big expectations behind it.

          "description": "The game formerly known as We Are OFK\nYou might remember a certain indie-pop miniseries game called We Are OFK, which started in August 2022 and released episodes up through Sept. 8. OFK is getting a rebrand today, as the developer is changing the name of its episodic adventure to Pop. Love. Panic! The OFK Story.\nAnnounced in a post today from the group's Twitter account, the band announces that its origin story game has a new name.\n\"We feel #PopLovePanic fits our story better!\" said the band. \"'We Are OFK' had a 'If You Know You Know' vibe, and we wanna be better about reaching out to people who haven’t already heard of our band.\"\nThe name change coincides with a sale on Steam, where you can get the full run of Pop. Love. Panic! for 30% off at the moment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2iKC4fVDs\nWhat's in a name?\nThough it sounds strange, changing the name of a game isn't as uncommon an experience as you'd think. I started back-searching instances in which this has happened, and found plenty of recent examples. Inti Creates retitled Grim Guardians to Gal Guardians in March, and Ubisoft changed Gods & Monsters to Immortals: Fenyx Rising prior to its release. That's not even accounting for the differences in titles between regions, like how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios is now doing away with the Western Yakuza moniker and unifying the series under Like a Dragon.\nAs for OFK and Pop. Love. Panic! The OFK Story, I hope the rebrand works well. We Are OFK has been on my backlog since reviews seemed warm on it. Though some were confused by the concept—an interactive fiction telling the origin story of a band, like video games meets The Gorillaz—it's unique and interesting. Whether OFK has more discography planned or not, it does seem like they've done something a bit outside the box already.\nThe post Indie music tale We Are OFK changes its name to Pop. Love. Panic!

The studio announced its closure earlier today, as the team looks to \"new futures.\"\nIn a post on Twitter, the PixelOpus crew thanked players for supporting their work.\n\"Dear friends, our PixelOpus adventure has to an end,\" the statement reads. \"As we look to new futures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to the millions of passionate players who have supported us, and our mission to make beautiful, imaginative games with heart. We are so grateful!\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Pixelopus/status/1654563543386296320\nSony confirmed the closure in a statement to IGN, stating that the studio will officially shut down on June 2. Here's the full statement:\nPlayStation Studios regularly evaluates its portfolio and the status of studio projects to ensure they meet the organization’s short and long-term strategic objectives. As part of a recent review process, it has been decided that PixelOpus will close on June 2.\n\nStudio members have been sharing their sentiments on social media, lamenting the \"loss of a great team, and a great project.\" The studio had previously been working on an unannounced project within PlayStation Studios.\nThe opus comes to a close\nPixelOpus was established in 2014 as a new in-house studio for Sony Interactive Entertainment. The team went on to make 2014's Entwined and then, in 2019, released Concrete Genie. The latter was fairly well-received.\nWe described it in our review as a lower-stakes adventure that was good for unwinding, and it had a pretty cool idea in its supernatural-graffiti concept. Overall, it sounded cool and this closure is sad to hear. Hopefully, everyone on the team lands on their feet.\nThe post PlayStation studio PixelOpus is shutting down appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Die-and-retry\nFormer homebrew NES title Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is making a stop on the Nintendo Switch on May 19, 2023. This follows a release on Xbox consoles in April 2022 and on NES in 2010.\nBattle Kid: Fortress of Peril is one of the more beloved homebrew titles for Nintendo’s classic console. Developed by Sivak Games and drawing inspiration from Mega Man and I Wanna Be The Guy, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is a die-and-retry gauntlet.\nhttps://youtu.be/4vvMLR-17Jo\nI actually own a copy of the NES title from its initial run with RetroUSB. Personally, I didn’t really love the game. However, I do recognize it as a quality homebrew project. I’ve played quite a bit of homebrew, and they’re extremely hit-and-miss, with the majority landing in the miss category. Often, they’re first-time projects for programmers, and I can really appreciate the passion behind them, even if I own a few that I can’t stand. I’m not naming any names. It’s mostly just that I rarely enjoy the die-and-retry genre, with Hotline Miami being one of the few I really love.\nStill, I don’t regret having that transparent green NES cartridge on my shelf. Homebrew has come a long way in the last decade. More and more companies have been getting into production. It warms my dusty, old heart.\nIn any case, I’m happy to see that Battle Kid: The Fortress of Peril isn’t staying locked on the hardware. The title is especially a good fit for the Switch, as it’s a console with a very pick-up-and-play mentality.\nIf you’re not into the Switch version or don’t want to wait, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, or via ROM from itch.io.\nThe post Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril moves to Switch on May 19 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While you can count the number of games we got over here on enough fingers if you have them, it was one of Konami’s flagship properties for over a decade in Japan. Part of the reason why we didn’t get more over here is that they’re just so Japanese. It takes place in Feudal Japan and ties in more local pop-culture references than you can shake a pipe at.\nDespite this, I was enamored by 1991’s Legend of the Mystical Ninja when I was a kid. It was fun to just mess around and explore in.

Characters occasionally act in ways that defy logic, and plot threads appear to contradict each other. Terranigma is also, without question, one of the best narratives I’ve experienced in a video game. For this reason, I put it in the Top 3 of the greatest SNES games ever made.\nTerranigma is the culmination of what is referred to as developer Quintet's \"Soul Blazer trilogy” on the SNES. Though it’s technically canon to Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia, Terranigma's connection to these games is mostly on a philosophical level (though you'll find a couple plot connections). You see, Quintet had the unique objective of using their 16-bit titles to explore the core of human nature. For Terranigma speci…",

This includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased on PC April 21, 2020, No One Lives Under the Lighthouse is a short-form horror that sees you taking over the duties at a lighthouse after the previous keeper went missing. Presented in terrifying PS1-o-vision, you’re tasked with unraveling the mystery while also tending to the needs of the titular lighthouse. It’s estimated at two hours long, which is usually a good mark for these sorts of games.\nhttps://twitter.com/PuppetCombo/status/1654476492326285318?s=20\nI actually bought No One Lives Under the Lighthouse on Steam, but haven’t gotten around to playing this. I’d probably prefer to stick with the PC version, but these sorts of games do tend to be a good fit for consoles.\nAlso, while I don’t believe Puppet Combo had any involvement with the development of the game, having their publishing label, Torture Star Video, handle the distribution of it is a good fit. Both brands are pretty synonymous with lo-fi horror, so it’s a good way to get more eyes on the title. Especially when it’s alongside games like Nun Massacre and Murder House.\nTorture Star Video has promised that it will be bringing more games to console in the near future.\nNo One Lives Under the Lighthouse is currently available on PC. It will be coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox SeriesX|S, and Switch on May 18, 2023.\nThe post Torture Star Video publishing No One Lives Under the Lighthouse on console May 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

They initially released the early version in April of 2020.\nLandlord’s Super is a sandbox game set against the backdrop of ‘80s Brittain. It’s a time of sweeping unemployment. You play as someone who, unable to find a job, decides to construct a house and rent it out. With very little money and few opportunities, you need to beg, borrow, and steal your supplies to create a worthwhile hovel.\nhttps://youtu.be/wrRU6HGkNRM\nIt’s a construction simulator first. You mix your cements and mortars, and build the home brick-by-brick. You’re given a lot of freedom in how you do this, but the amount of work required to complete a home is intense.\nUnderlying this is a representation of the time period. While building your home, you have to maintain yourself by eating, drinking, and showering. This also means you may be spending time at the local pub. To make money, you can do odd jobs around town, or simply wash dishes for a small stipend. It’s drudgery, but it’s fun drudgery.\nI’ve played quite a bit of Landlord’s Super in Early Access. It’s an interesting period piece that unapologetically adheres to the struggles of the time it represents. I have my complaints about the game, but I’m looking forward to seeing how it has all come together.\nLandlord’s Super is currently available on Steam Early Access.

Today’s video succinctly states that the first look at gameplay will arrive this summer. Odds are it will debut during Summer Game Fest or another adjacent event, but we’ll have to await confirmation to know for sure.\n\n\nPayday 3 has been in the works for a long time, having been officially announced in 2017. It hasn’t had the smoothest development cycle due to developer Starbreeze Studio flirting with closure at one point, among other factors. So far, we know that the co-op heist shooter is coming this year for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It stars the original gang from the previous games and unfolds in New York.\nWhat do you want to see in Payday 3? Let us know in the comments!",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  \nThere are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead.

          "description": "Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023.

Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action largely retains its 2D roots, the game now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at Microids Studio Lyon. \n\n\nFlashback 2 launches in November for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch and PC.",

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",

It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?
