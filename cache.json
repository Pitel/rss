Not that it will get dirty forever.” I’m not sure I’ve ever felt the crushing weight of universal entropic decay so keenly as in that RPG maker textbox, nested upon Felvidek’s nicotine-stain hues. I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.\n \nRead more",

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.\nRead more",

Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.\n \nRead more",

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment's open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.\r\n \nRead more",

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door.

It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, \"yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run.\" So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!\n Read more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.\nRead more",

It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.\n \nRead more",

The Typing of the Dead spin-offs are excellent examples of their incredible potential, but not enough developers and publishers have taken note. I need to give my home row a thrashing, and FromSoft Word gives me the challenge I need.\n\n\nI’ve already oversold it. FromSoft Word is a typing thing inspired by FromSoftware’s penchant for punishing games. Don’t expect something like Typing Souls, however. Don’t even expect it to be structured. Instead, prepare to be punished for your typos as you attempt to fill a white textbox…\n\n\nTextbox is apparently not a word. I guess it’s two words.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, that’s what you get: a big, blank text document and aggressive-sounding music. That’s exactly how I work most days, but normally, my misspellings are just attacked by squiggly red lines. At worst, my editor berates me (they don’t). In FromSoft Word, I get the echo-y death sound effect along with the words “You Made a Typo.” Harsh. I don’t even get to dispute word usage.\n\n\nBut while my game will end if I try to use the King’s spelling of favorite, it doesn’t care about whether or not I can place a comma. In that sense, it’s less brutal than my own self-criticism.\n\n\nSpeaking of criticism, while FromSoft Word allows you to export text while you still live, the moment the game over screen hits, you lose the ability to access what you’ve written. This alone means that it won’t become my new word processor of choice. A humiliating loss may be more true to the Souls series, but even Elden Ring allows me to return to my point of death to atone for my failures.\n\n\nFromSoft Word comes to us from Steven Nass and Peter Henningsen at Woe Industries. You can “play” it yourself for free over on itch.io.\n\nThe post FromSoft Word channels the punishment of Elden Ring into a word processor appeared first on Destructoid.",

The newly released Despicable Me 4 trailer features Carell introducing the Mega Minions in a planned universe where many movies and shows will expand the lore around the Mega Minions. Through the trailer, Illumination and Carell took a cheeky dig at the superhero franchise model from Marvel Cinematic Universe, which features loads of movies and shows that are interconnected and part of a main storyline that goes on for many years.\n\n\nIllumination took the joke a step further by revealing an official website where the planned timeline of movie releases and an official synopsis are listed. While the joke began with superhero movies and Marvel in particular, the quips expand to other movies as well, with clever nods to Star Wars, Jerry Maguire, James Bond, Mad Max, and more.\n\n\n\n\nThe official movie titles include Mega Minions Legacy, where the movie's plot states that the heroes must return “after the Anti-Villain League’s quarterly earnings dramatically miss estimates.”\n\n\nAnother hilarious movie is simply slated as an Untitled Mega Minion Spin-off and its outlined plot suggests that the story will be \"determined based on rigorous market testing and ad hoc decision-making.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe movie names and the Megaverse announcement are clearly a parody, but it would be interesting to see some of these many movie ideas come to fruition.\n\n\nDespicable Me 4 will have the super-powered Mega Minions at least, and the movie is slated for a release on July 3, 2024.\n\nThe post Steve Carell and Illumination troll Marvel Cinematic Universe with a parody Despicable Me 4 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Black Ops 6 seemed to have a total install size of 309.85GB as per the pre-order page, but Activision has now clarified this is not the case. \n\n\nThe publisher took to social media and said that the current estimated file size shown on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages “does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.”\n\n\nActivision explained that the 300GB download size includes the full installations of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Warzone, and “all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined.”\n\n\nThe publisher has further clarified that players will be able to download Black Ops 6 at launch without any requirements to download any other Call of Duty game or any need to download all language packs. Activision said that the “actual estimation” for Black Ops 6 file size will be revealed “closer to launch.”\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops 6 was recently revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, and there was an immediate showcase following the show, focusing solely on the title. Lead developer Treyarch Studios talked the viewers through the development of the game’s campaign, Zombies mode, and the new ‘omnimovement’ which allows players to dive in Max Payne fashion and roll around when they're prone. There is a lot more to look forward to, as the game inches closer to the October 25 release date.\n\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops 6 will also be the first CoD game to launch on Game Pass since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft.

Based on Matt Reeves’ The Batman, the show will be focusing on the villain Colin Farrell portrays in the movie. The Penguin show will be arriving in September, as revealed by Casey Bloys, chairman and CEO of HBO and Max, in an interview with Variety.\n\n\nColin Farrell as The Penguin in Matt Reeves’ Batman took everyone by surprise. The Irish actor’s complete transformation for the role after hours of make-up and a solid performance in the movie turned the character into an instant hit for the fans.\n\n\nNot so long after the movie’s release, The Penguin spin-off series was announced. The show will continue the story after the events from The Batman movie and will focus on Oswald \"Oz\" Cobblepot’s rise in the criminal underworld of Gotham, and become the Penguin. The series is also going to lay the foundations for The Batman: Part II which is scheduled to come out in 2026.\n\n\n\n\nThe show will see Farell return to reprise the titular character, and Cristin Milioti has joined the cast as Sofia Falcone, the daughter of Carmine Falcone, the late king of Gotham’s underworld. The Penguin will have eight episodes, with Lauren LeFranc serving as the showrunner.\n\n\nWhile The Penguin is a spin-off DC show, it will be considered as part of The Batman’s universe rather than the upcoming DC rebuild happening. DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has clarified in the past that all movies and shows that do not follow the main continuity timeline of the DC Universe, will be released with the DC Elseworlds label.\n\n\nMatt Reeves’ The Batman: Part II and Todd Philipps’ Joker: Folie à Deux are prime examples of projects that will be carrying the Elseworlds tag, keeping them separate for the overarching main storyline of DC, which kicks off with the release of Creature Commandos, an adult animated show releasing in late 2024.\n\nThe post Batman spin-off The Penguin release month revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

The celebrations are cut short when a ship crashes down at the festival, carrying the notion that the fight for survival and their home planet is not over yet.\n\n\nThe DLC will introduce The Heart of the Plains, a new location, and players will also get to take on a new enemy type known as the AMP Defender. This mech-suit carries a riot shield, as if it was not already hard enough to defeat the mechs with bows and arrows.\n\n\n\n\nThe celebration shown during the start of the trailer is known as The Great Games, and there will be several challenges themed around it for players to complete. Character progression will also be extended through this DLC with 25 more ranks to gain and spend skill points. Players can now reach master crafter status, and there will be a new Legendary rarity category for items.\n\n\nThere is a Season Pass available which grants you access to both of the planned story DLCs, The Skybreaker and Secrets of the Spires. The second DLC is planned for autumn 2024.

          "description": "Now that we've all seen the trailer for The Dark Ages, the brand-new Doom game that will be taking us back to medieval times, there was at least one thing that stood out for me: the Shield Saw. The teaser showed all the usual chaos and demon-slaying we know and love about the series, but the saw-looking shield in the Slayer's possession is next-level.\n\n\nWell, if you're intrigued about getting to try it out on the denizens of hell, your chance has already arrived. As spotted by PC Gamer, a modder has already added the \"Shield Saw\" seen in the Dark Ages trailer into the original Doom.\n\n\n\n\nThe mod comes from user Craneo, in which they say they just \"kinda ended up trying to make actual decorate [sic] for it.\" Soon after, they made the .WAD file available, which you can download from Google Drive here.\n\n\nA slice of violence\n\n\nYou can check out the brief footage above before you decide to download the mod. Essentially, it seems to replace the classic chainsaw from the OG in favor of the newfangled Shield Saw.\n\n\nWe get to see the Doom Slayer hacking away at Zombies and Imps as per, but the real USP comes when they throw it at oncoming enemies. Upon contact, it basically turns monsters into a fine paste, so it's a pretty beefy weapon.\n\n\nIt's also just one of countless examples of how quickly the modding community can move. Remember, the teaser for the new Doom only went live a couple of days ago, and Craneo's mod was released less than 24 hours later. Efficient, I'd say.\n\nThe post Classic Doom gets the ‘Shield Saw’ from Dark Ages, thanks to this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As one of the most popular survival horror franchises in gaming history, it's not hard to imagine that Resident Evil typically sells quite well. Still, it's impressive to learn that the eighth installment – Village – has now surpassed 10 million units since coming out just over three years ago.\n\n\nA recent release from Capcom says that not only has RE8 hit this milestone, it's also the fastest to achieve this across the whole Resident Evil series. This also means that, as of March 31, 2024, the entire franchise has sold more than 157 million copies worldwide. That's since it all began way back in 1996.\n\n\n\n\nSelling 10 million units is impressive by anyone's standards, and it shows that the most lucrative horror brand in all of gaming is still going strong after almost 30 years.\n\n\nMobile ports are likely the reason\n\n\nThe release from Capcom goes on to say that not only has the Gold Edition of Village been partly responsible for the recent increase in sales, but the iPhone and iPad ports released last October have also likely played a part.\n\n\nSpeaking of which, the developer also announced that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard will be coming to Apple products as of July 2. The post from X embedded above says that RE7 will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, plus all iPads and Macs that sport the M1 chip.\n\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Resident Evil 2 is also coming to Apple at some point. No release date for that port yet, but it's currently \"in development.\" Also, we can assume Capcom is referring to the remake rather than the original that came out in 1998. You know what, either would be grand.\n\nThe post Resident Evil Village hits 10 million sales, the fastest in the series to do so appeared first on Destructoid.",

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. \nFor the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. \n“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,\" said Linke. \"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.

Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.\nThe game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.\nFor more on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, head here.

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. \nThe 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. \n\n\nIf you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. \n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps. To learn more about the upcoming title, read our in-depth preview here.",

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.\nThe earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.",

          "description": "Xbox has revealed Doom: The Dark Ages, the third installment in developer id Software's modern Doom reboot. And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. \nFret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. \nId Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. \nInterestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well. \nWhat do you think of Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal?

Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.\nRevealed during the Future of Play Direct players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.\n\n\nThe game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a \"star-consuming threat.\" \nBattle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date.
