But you know something? That isn’t always a bad thing.

While it may have been New Star Soccer which brought the team at New Star Games to our attention in the first place, the Switch port of Retro Bowl cemented our love for its arcade-inflected gameplay and clear appreciation of classic gaming.\nIt was therefore with much anticipation that we heard of the team's plans to release a football (or 'soccer,' if you will) follow-up title, Retro Goal, on Switch this month — just in time for the World Cup, no less. Having previously played the title in its original mobile form, we were excited to see what New Star Games would do to ensure that the Switch port maintained all the retro joy of the original while updating things to work for its new console home.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The votes were cast in the run up to Scarlet and Violet's release on 18th November and passion for Pokémon generally runs higher in Japan than any other location.

Nearly a decade later (not counting two years of early access), Cellar Door Games has finally followed up on their breakout hit. Rogue Legacy 2 builds upon its predecessor and. even for those who haven't played the first, re-establishes what made it such an enduring hit.\nRogue Legacy 2 places you in the shoes of Lady Susie, a brave knight.

While there is nothing official to speak of on this front just yet, we have now seen a teaser trailer for an upcoming Super Mario Bros. 3 mod - named 'Super Mario Bros. 3 +' - which looks to bring a boat-load of new mechanics to the NES classic.\nCreated by @infidelity_nes and due to be published on romhacking.net during the Thanksgiving holiday break later on this month, the mod appears to take everything that we loved about the original game and dial it up to 11 with some interesting added content. Chief among these extras appears to be the addition of Princess Toadstool and Toad as playable characters. The princess is in another castle you say?

Some 13 years after it first released as a Flash game on web browsers, Patrick Smith's delightful Windosill has arrived on Switch, giving players a fresh chance to experience this breezy, playful, and rather magical little journey through a series of enchanting puzzles.\nWindosill's unique aesthetic has very obviously influenced the art style of the likes of Donut County and Monument Valley, and it's not too hard to see why other indie titles chose to look to this game for inspiration in the years following its original release. The wonderfully laid-back and often trippy vibe here elevates what is actually a rather simple and short experience — you can blast through it all in less than an hour — into something that really does have the power to stay with you long after you've completed its charming collection of challenges.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sparkling in chaotic but coordinated palettes of technicolor jaggies, it's immediately arresting – and once you start playing, it just gets better and better.\nThe set-up for this high-speed platforming adventure is something to do with a tanuki called Hana travelling through her dreams to get to the moon. Or whatever. You won’t be sitting through cutscenes in this game – A Grumpy Fox lets the gameplay do the talking. The skeletal narrative is sufficient excuse for playful and imaginative stage designs, ranging from a Japanese-shrine-flying-water-bubble-semi-undersea tropical resort with echos of Sonic Colors to a subdued forest of quiet autumn leaves.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With an overarching original plot, you can work your way across all three dojos — Cobra Kai, Miyagi-Do, and Eagle Fang — and take the reigns on their associated characters on different pursuits.

          "description": "Clever girl(s).\nFew franchises captured the minds of children everywhere like the original Jurassic Park film did in 1993; it kicked off an entire dinosaur craze while maintaining much of the novel’s poignant message exploring the perils of genetic engineering. Jurassic World – 2015’s revival starring Mario Chris Pratt – had nowhere near the same impact, though both critics and audiences found it to be a passable popcorn action thriller (and the less said about the other two films in the World trilogy, the better). Originally developed as a VR title for the Oculus Quest and now rejigged and ported to the Nintendo Switch — with the 'Part 2' DLC content included — Jurassic Park Aftermath Collection picks up two years after the events of Jurassic World but takes after the original film thematically.\nThe opening moments introduce you to the voice of Dr. Amelia ‘Mia’ Everett – you never actually see other humans as all dialogue comes through radio. Taking control of a voiceless security expert named Sam, it isn’t long before the rickety plane you’re on experiences some winged-dinosaur-related issues which cause the pilots to lose control and crash land on the infamous Isla Nublar. Mia, you see, hired you to help her retrieve her life’s work as a geneticist. The crash left her with a shattered leg, holed up in a bunker somewhere. From there, she feeds you information to help save both your lives.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it's a lot of fun when you're mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It's a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you'd like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can't get any better than this.\nRead more",

Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn't call him \"Boy!\", and also he won't shut up under any circumstances.\nRead more",

After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you're not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.\nAfterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience?

And if you're short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don't forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic.

Honestly, if there had been any hint of doubt around Elon Musk, he wouldn't have played such a prominent role in my cyberpunk novel about teens saving the world with NFTs. How could I have known, those six long months ago. Wow. Egg on my face. On all our faces.\nRead more",

The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.\nRead more",

Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?\nOh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.\nRead more",

Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.\nAnyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.\nRead more",

It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.\nRead more",

          "description": "Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). \nMostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me. \nRead more",

          "description": "I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.\nSo, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.\nRead more",

It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

          "description": "Scavenge the last hours before December\nThe free-to-play PvPvE survival shooter Scavengers is closing its doors. Studio Improbable confirms it will shut down Scavengers on December 16, 2022.\nIn an announcement, the team notes that it's been a while since its latest update. The reason for the closure looks to be a slowly dwindling player base for the shooter.\n\"The last few months have seen a decline in the playerbase, and whilst we explored many options to reinvigorate server population while the game is in early access, it became clear that it was unsustainable to continue development and live service,\" the statement reads. \"We’re all proud of what we accomplished, and are grateful to every player who took the time to play, even if it was just for a short while.\"\nThe studio says it plans to celebrate the next few weeks, leading up to the shutdown.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glYYdCz237o\nA jagged, gorgeous winter\nShown off at the 2018 Game Awards, Scavengers was originally in development at Midwinter Entertainment. The team was bought by Improbable in 2019, and Scavengers launched into an early access in 2021.\nIn May, Improbable sold Midwinter to Behaviour Interactive, where the team is now working on an unannounced project. A small team was left to keep Scavengers running, while the console versions were scrapped. Improbable said in a statement at the time that the cut was to help the company's announced focus on the metaverse.\nIt's a shame to see for the remaining Scavengers fans. Hopefully those who held out hope will see something they like in Midwinter's new project at Behaviour.\nThe post Multiplayer survival shooter Scavengers is closing down appeared first on Destructoid.",

That kind of mainstream recognition usually means there are some awesome collabs on the way, which is definitely true in this case. This time around, Riot teamed up with Nerf to create a life-sized replica of Jinx's classic blaster known as Fishbones, which was also featured in Arcane, as fans will remember.\nJinx's Fishbones is available for pre-order now (pre-orders close January 1, 2023, and will be shipping on December 31, 2022. The gun is a gargantuan 35 inches long, and features jaws that open and close as you shoot. It holds 18 total darts, shooting out a three round burst every time you pull the trigger. Fishbones also comes with a Jinx-inspired stand and \"display-worthy packaging\" for those who want to show it off for everyone to see. The NERF LMTD League of Legends Jinx Fishbones blaster retails for $169.99, and is available for pre-order on Amazon or directly from Nerf.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_BXWllD5k\nThe Jinx Fishbones collaboration is part of NERF LMTD, a \" premium, special edition, fan-focused line from the Nerf brand brings you some of the most iconic items from movies, video games, and entertainment with premium features and packaging.\" Other franchises that have been honored with a Nerf collab include Star Wars, Halo, Star Trek, Aliens, and G.I. Joe, just to name a few.\nThis has seriously got to be one of the coolest gaming merchandise crossovers I think I've ever seen, and absolutely something I wish I had when I was a kid. I've only touched League of Legends once in my life (that's a whole story for another day), but the second Nerf releases something from a game I play, I might just have to splurge and treat my inner child.\nThe post Nerf released a replica of Jinx’s gun from League of Legends appeared first on Destructoid.",

Neon Giant currently only has one notable title to its name — cyberpunk RPG The Ascent — but is currently developing an as-yet-unannounced first-person-shooter, set in an open-world environment.\nFounded in the spring of 2018, Neon Giant was formatively made up of a party of former AAA game developers, featuring talent pulled from best-selling franchises such as DOOM, Gears of War, Far Cry, and Bulletstorm. Selected by Epic Games as one of several studios to receive a monetary grant for its first project, Neon Giant would develop and release The Ascent on PC and consoles in 2021, where it would receive moderate-to-high praise from critics and players.\nWith this latest acquisition, Neon Giant will join a number of western developers recently picked up by Krafton. Other purchases by the holding company include Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds and Striking Distance Studios, who are currently busy putting the finishing touches to their gory sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol.\nThe Ascent is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post PUBG’s Krafton acquires The Ascent developer Neon Giant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Labored with NINTENDO RULES (tm)\nNintendo has released a new demo for its madcap sports title Mario Strikers: Battle League, giving Switch owners the opportunity to check out the colorful and chaotic soccer game free of charge. The demo is available to download from the eShop now.\nNintendo had previously released a trial for Mario Strikers prior to the game's launch back in June of this year, but that particular demo was locked to Nintendo Online subscribers. While this new demo can be accessed by all Switch users, it is still limited to Nintendo's precious limitations. For starters, only one game of the Cup Battle feature can be played before the option is locked out. In addition, players can only experience the \"Quick Match\" feature seven times, before that too becomes inaccessible.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1590517271679508482?s=20&t=t-qXago3izz8rLojADoTSA\nIt's likely that Nintendo is hoping to get more footy fans on board, given the coming of the FIFA World Cup. But it's going to be a tough sell. While Mario Strikers: Battle League is a perfectly fine multiplayer title for anyone who wants a kickabout with pals, the full release has also been criticized for being very barebones, while also suffering from a distinct lack of major content drops/roster expansions since its initial launch. At $60, it's a hefty ask for a game that has been particularly subdued during its honeymoon period.\nStill, if you and some pals fancy a bit of goofy footballing fun, then perhaps this new demo might help to win you over. At least you'll come away without any astro-burns, nor will you have to suffer some Big Lad blowing an air horn in your ear.\nThe post New Mario Strikers: Battle League demo available on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The free next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has been locked in for December 14.\nThis update will be free for those who already own The Witcher 3, so no need to worry about buying it twice. While the next-gen part points to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, CD Projekt Red also confirms it will also arrive for PC players. A physical version is also in the works for a later date.\nAs for what's in the update? CD Projekt will be showcasing that next week, in a special REDstreams over on their Twitch channel. The showcase will have some details, as well as a gameplay reveal for the fancier version of this massive RPG adventure.\nhttps://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1592177211481944068\nA shinier Wild Hunt\nThe next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a welcome end-of-year surprise. The project had been fairly quiet, as the spotlight had been mostly on other games like Cyberpunk 2077, which got its next-gen update earlier this year.\nAnd I can't lie, I've been waiting for this update too. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was one of the better RPGs of the last generation, especially with its excellent pair of DLC stories. I was just holding out for an excuse to hop back in, and well, this is as good as any.\nIt's a good time for a Witcher refresher too, as the series has a lot on the horizon. While part of CD Projekt is working on Cyberpunk, another branch is developing the next trilogy in The Witcher series. The Molasses Flood is also working on its own Witcher project, and third-party studio Fool's Theory is developing a remake of The Witcher, the first game, in Unreal Engine 5.\nThe post The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt gets its next-gen update in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, Nintendo revealed a new trailer for the Chill Season of Splatoon 3.\nThe season kicks off on December 1, and adds a bunch of new content to the third squid-kid shooter entry. New stages are in store, some old and some new, as are new weapons. Three brand-new weapons (for Roller, Charger, and Shooter) are joined by 10 returning weapons from the Splatoon series.\nFor competitive players, the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 will see the return of X Battles. These are special ranked lobbies that you can only access once you've hit an elite rank in Anarchy Battles. Once there, you can risk special points to compete in these X Battles. It's like an extra level of ranked to compete in, for even higher bragging rights.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rm4T2K4XZI\nBorn to Big Run\nOn the PvE side of things, the co-op Salmon Run mode is also seeing the debut of its Big Run mode. The Big Run has been teased in previous trailers, but it's a special in-game event that will bring the chaos of Salmon Run to a normal multiplayer map.\nThe first Big Run will kick off with the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 as Salmonids invade the Wahoo World stage. That's not very wahoo of them.\nMore info is on the way as to how this changes Splatsville, and how to play in this specific mode.

Kishimoto notes that he envisions Sonic Frontiers becoming one of the series' most important titles, ultimately shaping the future of the long-running franchise.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4\nLaunching November 8 on PC and consoles, Sonic Frontiers has, like most of The Blue Blur's games, been a divisive title, running the gauntlet of high and low scores from both critics and players. While many have praised the high-speed sequel's visuals and mechanical overhaul, the title has been criticized by some for its combat, \"boring\" environments, and bizarre juxtaposition of colorful, cartoonish characters with somber, monolithic enemies.\nRegardless, Sonic Frontiers has seen launch success. Over on the Steam platform, some 19,181 concurrent players were recorded at the game's launch, beating the previous series record — held by 2017's excellent throwback Sonic Mania. Whether Sonic Frontiers has the staying power to become the iconic release envisioned by Kishimoto remains to be seen, but this early admission that the title still has some way to go before developers will be pleased with the product does not go down smooth .\nSonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers director says team is examining feedback appeared first on Destructoid.",

Incredibly, Team Water came away with a perfect 45p score, meaning that the H2O lovin' squaddies ultimately won out in both Open and Pro battles, as well as winning the public vote.\n\nThis is one of the cleanest (no pun intended) sweeps in recent Splatoon history, and suggests that the Pokemon x Splatoon crossover community either really, really likes Water-type Pokemon, or that they simply converted their love of the wet stuff to fantastic in-game plays.\nYou can check out the full results below.\nPublic Vote\nTeam Grass: 25.80%\nTeam Fire: 33.60%\nTeam Water: 40.60%\nClout (Open)\nTeam Grass: 33.41%\nTeam Fire: 32.75%\nTeam Water: 33.84%\nClout (Pro)\nTeam Grass: 33.59%\nTeam Fire: 30.55%\nTeam Water: 35.86%\nThis special splatfest was, of course, held to help promote the release of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, both of which launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch on November 18.

          "description": "All in the family\nSomething delightfully novel for this week's Arcade Archives entry as Hamster pulls '80s alien blaster Baraduke out of its big bag of Namco games and gives it a fresh release on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nOriginally released to the coin-op market in 1985, Baraduke, (aka Alien Sector), sees intrepid space explorer Toby \"Kissy\" Masuo picking her way through a series of claustrophobic interplanetary caverns, taking on an army of gooey aliens and gathering up cute, cycloptic creatures known as \"Paccets\". Once all of the stage's enemies are destroyed, our hero ventures down a large connecting pipe to confront one of a number of boss guardians, before heading on to the next zone.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro Hawk.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3zzKZkNdsc\nFascinatingly, despite its relative obscurity, Baraduke predates Nintendo's legendary release Metroid by a full year, though it contains several similarities to the classic NES title. Not only does Baraduke feature a labyrinth of alien-created caverns, linked by a series of metal tubes, but the Namco game also reveals its woman protagonist as a \"surprise\" at the game's climax, much like the coming of Metroid's Samus Aran.\nBaraduke would be followed up by little-known sequel Bakutotsu Kijūtei in 1988, before the franchise effectively ended. Hilariously, in deep Namco lore, it is said that Baraduke protagonist \"Kissy\" eventually married and divorced Dig Dug protagonist Taizo Hori, with one of the pairing's children being Susumu Hori of Mr. Driller fame! Someone call Kevin Fiege, I want to see a Namco Cinematic Universe!\nBaraduke is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Mr. Driller’s mom hits the Arcade Archives in Namco classic Baraduke appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you have points to spare, you may as well throw them into this: especially if they're expiring!\nHere are the prizes:\nA gaming rocker chair (you choose between Mario, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, or Luigi)\nA 15 inch mega-plush Mushroom\nA 1-Up glow in the dark Switch wired controller\nA 1-Up glow in the dark Switch case\nWhile many contests tend to be first party games releasing at the time (like Kirby): this one smartly rolls with Nintendo's \"fab\" Mario squad.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "You had me at \"dark fairytale\"\nWith Stardew Valley being one of my most-beloved and most-played games of all time, I am constantly on the hunt for the next game that can scratch my farming/community simulator itch. There have been quite a few that I've written up over the past few months, and the newest title to add to the list of hopeful successors is the sandbox life sim RPG, Kynseed, which has been described as a \"Stardew Valley-inspired game with 'dark fairytale' creatures.\" Yeah, sign me up.\nThe game has been in early access since November 8, 2018, but it's finally getting its official release on December 6, 2022, as was announced in a newly-dropped release date trailer. Fans who have followed Kynseed all through its development are beyond thrilled to see the game nearing its completed state, as can be seen in the comments sections of its trailers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4rSiixt_Q\nThe release trailer showcases the usual fare for these kinds of games, like farming, cooking, and fishing, but things really get wild once they dive into the combat. Fighting off monsters looks a lot more intense than the slow-paced combat of Stardew, with more of a strategic, turn-based thing going on. I've really come to appreciate combat mechanics a lot since I had a big Stardew binge a few years ago, so I'll be interested to see how Kynseed's spin on things continues to evolve the simulator genre.\nOh, and did we mention that the developers behind Kynseed are industry veterans from the classic Fable series, now under the new banner of PixelCount Studios. Based on what we know of the game so far, it seems like they've injected this new project with all of the character and whimsy we can expect, so this is definitely one I'm looking forward to checking out on release day.\nThe post Kynseed is a Stardew-like with a “dark fairytale” theme coming this December appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, the DLC drop adds five new weapons to our girl's arsenal of death, and includes several brand new side-quests that can be found and completed in Steelrising's other districts.\nWhile Steelrising was not quite the gemstone it might have been, I still found it a gorgeous-looking and very challenging adventure, that rose above its budgetary shortcomings thanks to its classy visuals and in-depth combat mechanics. While certainly not for everyone, the ambitious adventure is a sign that, as a developer, Spiders is growing with each successive release, and I hope that a future sequel could really deliver upon the game's compelling premise.\nSteelrising is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Delve into Cagliostro’s Secrets in new Steelrising DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Across each of the show's six episodes, we will journey with Miriam as she meets a party of noble and ignoble allies, confronting the tragedy of her past and forging a better future for herself, her people, and Tevinter itself.

I remember vividly when some parents at the time called it a fad: well, who's laughing now? The Pokemon Company, all the way to the bank.\nOf course, said company likes to take advantage of that nostalgia at any turn, and that includes a brand new interactive digital gallery of the series. You can find the gallery here.

Then select \"start\" at the bottom of the page.\nOnce you're in, you'll walk through an interactive game of sorts, where you can control a little avatar with a mouse click/tap or the arrow keys. While most of the text is in Japanese, you'll still be able to see dates for releases clearly: as well as installations like the giant Game Boy and the packaging for Pokemon Red and Green. Starters, legendaries, and key Pokemon are part of the exhibit too: and can be clicked on for further investigation (as well as items like the Pokeflute).\nIt's genius timing, as Scarlet and Violet are going to usher in a brand new generation in just a week.\nThe post This official online interactive Pokemon gallery is really cool appeared first on Destructoid.",

But given the historical significance (depending on who you ask) of Big the Cat, you could argue it actually fits here.\nHere's a quick guide on how to approach fishing in the game.\n\nIn Sonic Frontiers, fishing has to be done at fish icons on the map\nSo you can't just get a special fishing rod item and fish anywhere on the map: but by that same token, the minigame doesn't require you to get a unique fishing rod either.

          "description": "RED Christmas\nNetflix has released the first teaser trailer for its upcoming series The Witcher: Blood Origin — The series, which will debut on the streaming service from December 25, will serve as a prequel to its smash-hit show, which is itself upon the books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.\nThe Witcher: Blood Origin is set around 1200 years before the arrival of legendary figures such as Ciri, Yennefer, and, of course, Geralt of Rivia himself, and will tell the story of the fabled \"Conjunction of the Spheres\", the moment when the worlds of man, elf, and monster first collided, leading to a bold and dangerous new era for man and beast alike. The series will depict the coming of the event, alongside the necessary founding of a legion of beast slayers known as \"Witchers\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry6HYg3AsHA\nThe new, four-part series will be headed up by the legendary Michelle Yeoh (Shang-Chi, Everything Everywhere All at Once) as the formidable sword-elf Scian. Yeoh will be joined by Jodie Turner-Smith (Anne Boelyn, True Blood) as the highly-skilled Queen's guard officer Éile, and Laurence O'Fuarain (Game of Thrones, Vikings) as the redemption-seeking warrior Fjall. The cast is rounded out by Mirren Mack, Zach Wyatt, and Jacob-Collins Levy.\nThe Witcher: Blood Origin will offer up an original story, set within the same universe as the games and original novels but telling a tale of new characters and events. The show will precede the arrival of the fourth season of The Witcher, which will see Liam Hemsworth take up the dual swords of Geralt of Rivia, donning the well-worn scabbard of departing actor Henry Cavill.\nThe Witcher: Blood Origin premieres December 25 exclusively on Netflix.\nThe post Check out the trailer for Netflix prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin appeared first on Destructoid.",

This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. \nUnfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. \nIf it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you tuning into the finale event for Fortnite Chapter 3?

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\n \nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

          "description": "Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn't received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway's NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.\nIn August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise's return through NFL Blitz Le…",

However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat.

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.\nYou can read her full statement below: \nMany of you have been asking about the MWII soundtrack release.\npic.twitter.com/UEqgpCTjUg\nNovember 3, 2022\nFor more, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on the score of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II?

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. \nCheck out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. \nAtomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. \nFor additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more. \nAre you excited about Atomic Heart?

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series?

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.",
