          "description": "Hey, everybody. Want to kill all humans?\nThere is no shortage of terrible things buried deep underground, but, in Ancient Weapon Holly, you get to be the worst of them. This roguelike from Acquire, one of the studios behind the Octopath Traveler series, puts you in control of a powerful robot that seeks revenge on the humans that buried it for thousands of years. Reaching the surface and killing all humans will take a bit longer than you’d expect, though.\nAt first glance, Ancient Weapon Holly is a serviceable, fun, action-packed roguelite. The game consists of ten levels to play through, each one increasing in difficulty. Holly starts with a basic ranged attack and the ability to open up pits in the floor for enemies to fall into. These can be closed up to instantly kill most enemies, particularly once you’ve upgraded your attack power through the game’s version of a sphere grid. It is an interesting mechanic and the combat is chaotic enough to keep you interested for a few hours, but the game’s lack of depth makes it feel repetitive long before Holly reaches the surface.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The narrative isn’t particularly noteworthy, but it’s well handled with attractive intermittent stills and quick dialogue exchanges. It’s certainly less intrusive than the Gunvolt series in this respect, interjecting just enough story to make things whole without making you labour through excruciatingly drawn-out reams of waffle. Instead, its waffle is brief, occasionally mildly amusing, and mostly to the point.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I still don’t fully understand the rancor with which the RTX 4070 Ti is often regarded. Where some see an overpriced, memory-deprived albatross of a graphics card, I’ve only ever seen a fast and feature-rich GPU whose 12GB of VRAM is demonstrably fine for 99.95% of games at 4K. A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.\nNow, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.\nRead more",

The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. \r\n\n\r\nOr at least, that's what they're said to be saying now. I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described \"professional fraudster\" should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic's own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.\nRead more",

          "description": "As with all headlines that are phrased as a question, the answer is \"probably not\", but in any case, Miyazaki has mysteriously hinted at there being at least one secret thing in Elden Ring that players haven't found yet. On this week's Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss this, as well as some of our favourite and least favourite deployments of the video game Easter egg. We also talk about what we've been playing this week (Nightingale; PowerWash Sim, natch) and visiting Scotland. Sadly neither of us got to go to the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience.

He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. \"I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,\" he tells me.\nThe pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, \"we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,\" he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had \"a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks\" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but \"Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,\" says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, \"you can kind of see how that went from A to B\".\nRead more",

Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the \"you're about to be unemployed\" language right there. The company is moving away from \"the development of future licensed IP\" and toward \"our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities\".

Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.\nRead more",

I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).\nCrucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.\nRead more",

Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products. In this article are some benchmarks of the open and proprietary kernel driver options of the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver.",

In Sphere of Influence, rapid technological and societal changes of the Victoria Era allows empires to compete in new lands and with new means. The expansion has a handful of new features including the ability to create your own Power Bloc and then bully, bribe, or befriend other nations to get them to join.\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Game\n\n\nSphere of Influence also focuses on The Great Game, a 19th-century rivalry between the British and Russian empires over influence in Central Asia. Players can use Prestige to become a Great Power and create their own Power Bloc, from which they can dominate other nations in diplomatic arrangements or use the bloc to pursue common economic or ideological goals.\n\n\nPlayers also have the opportunity to play as any of the powers central to The Great Game conflict, including Persia and Afghanistan. The map has been redrawn to highlight the many competing interests during The Great Game.\n\n\nOther features of Sphere of Influence include Foreign Investments, Nationalization, Subject Interactions, Interest Group Lobbies, and many more systems built around the new Power Bloc feature.\n\n\nI've got about 30 or so hours in Victoria 3so far and have been waiting for an update like this to jump back in. The ability to ccreate a Power Bloc will really change up the strategies you can use to effectively grow your empire, and I'm excited to see how it all works.\n\n\nTo celebrate the news, a Trains Bonus Content Pack with ten new 3D models for trains from the early days of steam to the golden age of rail is available to download for free for anyone who owns Victoria 3.\n\n\nVictoria 3: Sphere of Influence is set to release on PC on May 6, 2024 for $29.99.\n\nThe post Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence expansion focuses on The Great Game, releases in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

The stoic protagonist from Final Fantasy 7 has appeared in countless titles over the years, sometimes even with a new look. However, one iconic detail of Cloud's attire is his Buster sword. While the sword looks wholly unwieldy, Cloud easily manipulates his Buster Sword like he's swinging around a whiffle ball bat.

It will be part of a 3-wave Expansion Pass for Persona 3 Reload that includes BGM sets and Velvet costumes as well. While the cosmetic content releases next week and in May, The Answer releases in September.\n\n\n\n\nPersona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass\n\n\nThe Expansion Pass is split into three waves. The first wave releases on March 12 and includes a Persona 5 Royal EX BGM Set and a Persona 4 Golden EX BGM Set. Then, in May, Expansion Pass owners will receive the Velvet Costume cosmetics and a new BGM Set. Finally sometime in September, Episode Aigis, The Answer, will be released. The Answer is essentially post-ending DLC to Persona 3 which expands the story and adds some new content as well.\n\n\nSurely, not everyone is going to be happy with this news.  For starters, many were shocked to see that Persona 3 Reload would not include The Answer in the base game. Also, choosing to bundle it into an Expansion Pass that features some music and a few costumes with a $35 price tag seems a bit steep when the base game was already $70.\n\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get access to the Expansion Pass for free through January 31, 2025.\n\n\nPersona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass will be available starting March 12 when the first BGM wave drops.

And better yet, it's happening today.\n\n\nConfirmed during today's Xbox Partner Showcase, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Legends of the Zone Trilogy is out today for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The Xbox One version hits today, while a patch is due out later this year to bring additional graphic enhancements and features, per the Xbox Wire post. [Update: After publication, GSC Game World confirmed that the collection is coming to PS4 and PS5 in a similar manner. We've updated the article to reflect as much.]\n\n\nWhile unprecedented, this move isn't necessarily totally unexpected, as the upcoming STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on its way. With the long-awaited sequel bound to drop on September 5, 2024, releasing the three classic PC games on consoles before the big event is an excellent opportunity for GSC Game World to drum up some excitement well ahead of time. \n\n\nThe Legends of the Zone\n\n\nIt's going to be particularly interesting to see whether the Legends of the Zone re-release will also launch on PC, and what sort of upgrades might the developer have spliced into the package. Whatever the case may be, it's curious to see whether the mod.io support that GSC plans to roll out for Legends of the Zone will match up to its the massive mod support S.T.A.L.K.E.R. already sees on PC.\n\n\nRegardless, the ability to play the old STALKER games on consoles is not something we expected to see, so it's a thrilling development no matter what.\n\nThe post The original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games arrive on console today appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can pre-order the deluxe edition today to get access to the beta.\n\n\nThe original game focused on your building a city in the middle of a disastrous ice age to shelter your people. You had to keep them warm, gather resources, and endure harsh storms. Frostpunk 2 takes place 30 years later, and the focus moves back to a larger picture with your city sprawling out into much larger proportions with different factions vying to have their ambitions met.\n\n\n\n\nThe new trailer doesn’t have a lot of information we don’t already know (aside from the release date), but it does give us another glimpse at the direction it’s going with big, sprawling cities compared to the intimate ones of the original.\n\n\nThe trailer also shows off its Deluxe Edition, which includes seven-day beta access in April, post-launch DLC, access to story mode three days before launch, a novella, an artbook, and a soundtrack.\n\n\nI enjoyed the original Frostpunk, but after I completed its campaign (on maybe my third attempt), I didn’t have much desire to return to it or its DLC. I love survival city builders, though, and Frostpunk is royalty among them, so I’ll probably give the second a try.\n\n\nFrostpunk 2 releases on July 25, 2024 for PC, with Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions afterward.

Square Enix's massive MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV got a full launch date for Xbox Series X|S consoles today, locking it in for March 21.\n\n\nAnnounced during the Xbox Partner Showcase for March 2024, FF XIV will open its doors for Xbox players later this month. The service has already hosted an open beta for the MMO, but starting March 21, Xbox owners will be able to fully dig into the world of Eorzea.\n\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate owners will also be able to pick up the Starter Edition through Game Pass, between March 21 and April 19. If it's similar to the Starter Edition offered on other platforms, it'll provide entitlement for the base game A Realm Reborn and the first two expansions, Heavensward and Stormblood, as well as a thirty-day sub.\n\n\n\n\nIf you still need convincing and haven't heard the meme yet, Final Fantasy XIV also offers a generous free trial that includes access to the aforementioned A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, and Stormblood. You won't get some of the nice features like additional retainers, but if you're looking to experience a good story in an MMO world, it's a good option.\n\n\nFor those Xbox owners bummed they don't have the most recent Final Fantasy release on their console right now, Final Fantasy XIV might be the balm you need. I can attest that, even though I showed up years late to the party, Final Fantasy XIV is a darn good time, whether you're soloing or partying up.

          "description": "Xbox kicked off the Xbox Partner Showcase with Unknown 9: Awakening. Originally teased in 2020, we haven't really seen much about the action-adventure game. However, developer Reflect Entertainment have released a new Announcement trailer highlighting the protagonist Haroona and detailing the gameplay players can expect when the game releases in Summer 2024.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the gameplay it reminds me a lot of Assassin's Creed with powers. Haroon, portrayed by actress Anya Chalotra best known as Yennefer in The Witcher, yields powerful skills called Umbric abilities. With these powers Haroon can manipulate people, objects, and weapons from a distance.\n\n\nUnknown 9: Awakening will release in Summer 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Unknown 9: Awakening is still a game, coming out in Summer 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the March Xbox Partner Preview, we’ve got a first look at the gameplay of 11 Bit Studio’s The Alters. A game about employing yourself in space.\n\n\nThe Alters has you play as a miner named Jan Dolski, who gets stranded on another planet.\n\n\n\n\nTo stay alive, he needs to make use of a base that, unfortunately, requires multiple trained people to run. Conveniently, the planet is also home to a substance called “Rapidium,” which allows Jan to make different versions of himself called Alters. Each one is an alternate version of himself with their past having been changed.\n\n\nThe trailer gives examples where Jan fights to save his marriage or doesn’t leave his hometown. He’s able to alter choices in his past and build them into these Alters, which gives them experience that he doesn’t have, so they can help him survive. However, the trailer points out that their different pasts can create friction between the crew, as they have their own goals and personalities.\n\n\nIt looks like an interesting concept. I just have to wonder how the gameplay will balance out between management and exploration. Is there crafting? I hope not, because I’ve done enough of that.\n\n\nThe Alters is set to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.\n\nThe post The Alters shows off its quantum cloning gameplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As we approach the arrival of the Fallout TV adaptation, it's not too much of a stretch to assume a lot of people in the gaming world will be thinking about Bethesda's ongoing series. With that, don't be surprised to learn that you can now get customized Xbox Series X|S controllers themed after the post-apocalyptic franchise.\n\n\nThe latest news story over on Xbox Wire shows the control pads that have been given some Fallout love. I don't mean they're highly irradiated. Rather, there's a bunch you can now get from the Design Lab that you could argue have been inspired by the games.\n\n\n\n\nThere are actually four variants to pick from: Vault Dweller, Brotherhood, Pip-Boy, and Mutants. Each of them comes with the same basic covering on the controller, but with slightly different colors to the D-pad and analog sticks.\n\n\nI feel so S.P.E.C.I.A.L. now\n\n\nIf you've never used the Xbox Design Lab, it basically allows you to create your own Xbox control pads by customizing the look. You can change the color of the main body, add rubber grips on the back, and put some engraving on it as well.\n\n\nObviously, with this latest one boasting an official Fallout design, it's not going to be cheap. A basic controller with the new look – and nothing else being changed – would set me back just under $85. Who says gaming isn't an expensive hobby?\n\n\nThis also comes just a day after it was announced that a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed Xbox Series X would be launching this week. March 7, to be precise, if you're interested. Not me, though. Guess I'll be sticking with boring black for now.\n\nThe post You can now get a Fallout-themed Xbox Controller through Design Lab appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, I  need to work out a system to let everyone know I'm not the real me. For now, let's take a look at a curious monstrosity that's coming to id Software's iconic FPS.\n\n\nOver on ModDB, user Anya_Forger is in the midst of modding Doom 2 so that reminds us all of the pain that once was 1996's Bubsy 3D. It's a curious mix, I have to admit, but it remains to be seen why this is happening at all. I'm weirdly excited for it.\n\n\nImage via Anya_Forger/ModDB.\n\n\nCurrently, \"Bubsy Doom\" is still a work-in-progress, with no release date yet. For now, you can download a small taste, which converts the classic Doom menu screen into the one from Bubsy. There are plans to hopefully incorporate levels and MIDI sounds from the latter into the former, but currently the creator is busy with real-life obligations.\n\n\nIt could breathe new life into the long-forgotten games\n\n\nWhile the modder is planning to bring Bubsy 2 into Doom as well, it's the mention of incorporating Bubsy 3D that will be cause for some curiosity. It's generally regarded as one of the worst games ever released, which in a way makes it a pretty significant part of gaming history.\n\n\nAnd for all we know, Anya_Forger may actually enjoy the game. Who are we to judge? All I can say is they seem genuinely excited about making their project, saying \"aren't these mod developers wonderful?\"\n\n\nIt's also another notch in the bedpost of Doom modding. There are so many out there, from Doom meets Friday the 13th to Doom but all the sound effects are from Half-Life. We've seen it all. Well, nearly all.\n\nThe post This cursed mod mashes up Doom 2 and Bubsy appeared first on Destructoid.",

I mean, we all know it's been heavily inspired by Pokémon, but if you want to see it veer even closer, a recent demake project really makes the world look like Pokémon.\n\n\nAs spotted by WCCFTech, YouTube channel 64 Bits recently uploaded a proof-of-concept video that shows what Palworld would look like as a DS game. This includes giving it the retro look and top-down view you'd imagine it would have if it was released on the Nintendo console.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the description under the video says the team was heavily inspired by \"Pokémon Ranger, Black, White, Diamond, Pearl, basically all the DS Pokémon titles.\" However, they've also taken some cues from the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.\n\n\nA plethora of your preferred pixelated pals\n\n\nThe video itself really does show what Palworld could potentially look like if it was truly styled after older entries in Nintendo's dominant IP. It's actually quite cute. However, it should be noted that it is just a video. As far as I can tell, there's no attempt to actually demake the game in this manner.\n\n\nNor would anyone likely dare. If Nintendo is keen on pursuing Pocketpair over copyright issues, there's no way the community would risk litigation by making their own similarly-inspired project.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, it feels like we're passing through the tail end of Palworld's initial popularity. The studio is still sending out updates, but we're probably not going to see another uptick until the game fully releases, whenever that's going to be.\n\nThe post Wanna see Palworld as a Nintendo DS game? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it launched last October, Alan Wake 2 was noted as a superb follow-up to its cult Xbox 360 predecessor. Visually, it was something to behold. However, being quite a graphically demanding game meant people with older hardware were left out—until now.\n\n\nRecently, Eurogamer was given exclusive access to an upcoming patch for Alan Wake 2 which aims to optimize the sequel for previous-gen graphics cards. Specifically, the update will put focus on making the game compatible with Nvidia GTX 10-series GPUs, powered by the Pascal architecture.\n\n\n\n\nIn a benchmark test, a Digital Foundry video found that, once the patch starts rolling out on March 6, those with GTX hardware should see some pretty significant upticks in performance.\n\n\nIt's not a cure-all, though\n\n\nCurrently, the likes of the GTX 1060 (which is the fourth most used GPU on Steam) don't support mesh shaders, something AW2 uses for better visual acuity. However, the new patch should fix this. \n\n\nThe video above shows that framerates do increase, boosting overall performance by around 45%, even up as much as 85% for the likes of the GTX 1080.\n\n\nHowever, the aforementioned 1060 is still not entirely suitable for the game to run at a decent rate. While Digital Foundry saw increases from 15 to 25 frames on average (thanks to the removal of mesh shaders) in dense areas, this still falls short of what most gamers expect these days, which is 30fps at the very minimum.\n\n\nThere also appear to be no optimizations for the AMD equivalent, the RX 580, a card that came out in 2017. Given that Team Red is no longer supporting this GPU, it's probably not in Remedy's best interests to make Alan Wake 2 compatible with this (and much older) hardware.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 patch will optimize the game for older Nvidia GPUs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Steam Deck may have its work cut out for it soon, as pre-orders for the upcoming Claw device from MSI are being taken. We also have a release date, with one of the models launching on March 8 in the US, followed by the other two variants a week later.\n\n\nAs reported by Videocardz, the Claw is up on sites like Newegg, with options to place a pre-order ready for launch day. There are three variations planned, and it looks like the mid-range device releases first, priced at $749. Which is not cheap, really.\n\n\n\n\nFor that price, you'll get a Windows-based handheld gaming PC with an Intel Core Ultra 7-155H CPU under the hood and 512GB of NVMe SSD storage.\n\n\nAnd many more initialisms\n\n\nThere is a cheaper model in the Intel Core Ultra 5-135H variant, which also comes with 512GB capacity. This is currently priced at $699 on Newegg and with a March 15 release date.\n\n\nThe same goes for the more expensive Claw, which will set you back $799. That benefits from the same processor as the mid-range model but does have 1TB of SSD storage.\n\n\nOn top of this, MSI recently announced that the Claw also comes with seven days of Ubisoft+ for free. Whether that's going to justify the cost is dependent on how often you're likely to use Ubisoft's service, I suppose. Also, the fact that the above tweet says the offer available is from February 15 is a bit odd seeing as the device isn't even out yet. Not sure if that's a typo or not.\n\n\nIn any case, we're seeing quite the flood of Steam Deck competitors hit the market lately. We've already had offerings from ASUS and Lenovo, but it feels as though Valve's mobile PC is still a lot of people's first choice for now.\n\nThe post Steam Deck’s latest rival, the MSI Claw, releases this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "El Paso, Elsewhere developer Strange Scaffold has announced a five-game deal with publisher Frosty Pop. As part of the announcement, they’ve revealed a trailer for their next game, Life Eater, which is out on April 16, 2024.\n\n\nI find this trailer rather unsettling.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer shows off the game’s timeline interface where you must learn the habits and schedule of your quarry so that you may find the opportunity to abduct them. You play as a “modern day druid” who is tasked with performing an annual sacrificial ritual to delay the end of the world. It looks like once you have your quarry, you then take their organs to “water the flower.”\n\n\nLife Eater looks to be a rather evocative game. It has you violate the lives of others while framed as someone performing a necessary evil. Just the fact that you’re learning intimate details of the lives of others and monitoring them for the moment to strike is rather discomforting. The information on the game even suggests that the whole “dark god” angle might be false. I'd play it.\n\n\nThe store page promises “replayable blend of authored and generated stories.” It features music from David Mason who was the composer of Dredge.\n\n\nAs an aside, there are modern-day Druids, as Druidry is a modern religion based on pagan cultures. I don’t think they generally converse with dark gods and perform sacrifices. Just weird to see that as a contextual descriptor.\n\n\nLife Eater releases on PC on April 16, 2024.\n\nThe post Strange Scaffold’s disturbing kidnapping sim Life Eater is out in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by \"himself,\" I mean multiple versions of himself.\nJan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the \"what if\" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. \n\n\nThe Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima is finally riding to PC. The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. \nIn terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. \n\n\nDeveloper Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.\nPer the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” \nGhost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. \nGhost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.",

          "description": "In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nThe 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.\nPlayers take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. \nThat's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.\n\n\nAs you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. \nIt's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series.

You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.\nI had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

On top of revealing new titles and over a dozen trailers, we’ll learn more about the mechanics of Tales of Kenzera: Zau. The event will reveal new gameplay footage of Capcom’s mysterious action game Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which was first announced last summer. We'll also learn more details of The First Berserker: Khazan, the single-player action RPG set in the Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) universe. Microsoft says this will be a “no frills” showcase, meaning it will consist of nothing but new trailers, new games, behind-the-scenes looks, and release date announcements. \nThe event will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on various Xbox channels such as YouTube and Twitch. It will run for 30 minutes.\nAre you excited to watch the Xbox Partner Preview? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "A new trailer for Greedfall 2: The Dying World reveals that the game is launching into Early Access via Steam sometime this summer. The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.\nPremiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. \n\n\nSpiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: \n\n\nOnce its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.\n\n\nThe game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. \nCataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.",

However, the game will still be available to play. \nPlayers who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.\nCrash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. \nWe quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, \"Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try.\" \n\n\nIn related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft.

Whether you're Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there's plenty that will leave you satisfied. \nChief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. \nHere's Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\n\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, and then check out our guide of the best side quests in the game. After that, check out our Queen's Blood tips and tricks (and our best deck build), and then read about how New Game Plus works in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. That's not all, though – we also have a ranking of every minigame and a segway showdown between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. \nWho's your number one date option in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth?

Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. \nOnce the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. \n\n\nBloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. \nSaber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed.

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.",

For details of bugs fixed in each preview\nrelease, see previous entries on this blog.\nAccess real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio\n\nDevice streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.\n\nGeneral fixes and features\nBelow is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug \nreports, which help us to make Android Studio better.
