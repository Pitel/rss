The game joins Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town as the second modern remake of a farming classic, introducing new players to a franchise that's now been running for over 25 years.\nNot only that, but there are an awful lot of Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons games For the uninitiated, the reasoning behind the name change in the mid-2010s can prove slightly baffling. You see, Harvest Moon is now Story of Seasons, but Harvest Moon still exists, but it's not the true Harvest Moon, because that's Story of Seasons now. Get it? No, that was a terrible way of explaining it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Playing Diablo IV gave me a real case of the \"have I changed, or have the games changed?\", and I think the answer is \"yes\". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warfcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo III, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.\nTo wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.\nCountless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”\nHere’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.\nThere have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.\nRead more",

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can.

Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.\nIn my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on.

Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.\nBased on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.\nRead more",

If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.\nWhile the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.\nRead more",

Boltgun. What’s the gameplay like? Boltgun! What’s the story? BOLTGUN! Okay, there is technically a story, but it’s a thin excuse to let you shoot crunchy Chaos things in 40k, and shooting things in 40k means BOLTGUN!!!\nBoltgun is a retro-styled first-person shooter, or boomer shooter, to use the parlance of our times. Cast as a Space Marine, one of 40k’s genetically engineered fascist super soldiers, it’s your job to secure the Plot Device and prevent 40k’s already crappy Imperium from getting even crappier. As you can probably guess, this means running around at incredible speeds and shooting hordes of cultists, traitors and daemons in the face until they fall down, explode into chunks of bright red gore, or both.\nRead more",

          "description": "After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). \nI'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.\nRead more",

They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. \nAccording to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only \"acceptable\" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now. \nRead more",

It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely.

In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.\r\n\n\r\nIt was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Right now you can pick up a great deal on a powerful RTX 4070 Ti gaming PC over at CCL, equipped with a Core i5 12400F processor, 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM, an MSI Pro B660M-E motherboard and 1TB Kingston NV2 NVMe SSD - all for £1260. That's an awesome spec for gaming at 1080p, 1440p and even 4K - such is the power of this mighty GPU!  \nTo get this price, plus two freebies - a copy of Diablo 4 (£60) and a gaming headset (£30) - select the \"No OS\" option and use code GAMER40 at the checkout. \nYou can of course opt to get Windows preinstalled if you prefer, but you can also use a USB stick and any unused Windows keys you've already got, including those from previous versions of Windows, to install the OS yourself. And, as the Steam Deck proves, gaming on Linux is getting pretty damn good - and of course, Linux is completely free (as in beer and as in speech). \nRead more",

          "description": "For the last six years, my Skyrim wood elf has been stuck in some godforsaken cave in goodness knows what corner of Tamriel. I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.\nWorse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.\nRead more",

That means it should be well clear of ye olde Starfield, but that \"supposed to\" also suggests the date isn't set in stone yet.

Across its six-hour run time, you'll encounter a string of environmental puzzles, an evil plan concocted by a group of baddies, a rich orchestral soundtrack that swells at all the right moments, a cute animal companion, and a gorgeous world that needs saving. \nOn paper, it has everything you could possibly want from this kind of game, but in practice, it can also be Lana's undoing at times. It does everything well - admittedly some much better than others - but it feels like this sci-fi tale is missing something. That gut punch, that sigh of relief after a thrill, that unexpected surprise... You know, that extra edge to really make it sing. It’s still a very enjoyable adventure, but its lack of emotional highs means it doesn't linger long in the memory once you've seen the credits roll. Is that a roundabout way to say that Planet of Lana is a solid 7/10? Maybe, but we don't do that here.\nRead more",

This seems to suggest that the delay is a positive one, and will allow the studio to implement whatever benefits the new partnership has allowed for. Mega Cat notes that it expects to announce a new release before May is done and dusted.\nhttps://twitter.com/megacatstudios/status/1658095888227770370?s=20\n\"While we are disappointed that we couldn’t share the entirety of WrestleQuest with you sooner like we hoped,\" concludes the studio, \"we firmly believe this is the right choice with respect to our players and the sweat, sweat, and more sweat we have poured into building the best game we have ever made. We can’t wait to get your hands on it!\"\nWrestleQuest, as we have previously reported, combines the wild spectacle of golden age wrestling with the stat-based strategy of turn-based RPGs. Players will guide custom superstars through the territory system of the 1980s, aided or hindered by a roster of over 30 real-world wrestlers including “Macho Man” Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant. Jeff Jarrett is also in the mix, because he can't stay out of fucking anything.\nWrestleQuest is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post (Update) WrestleQuest has been future endeavored until August 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Typically games new games are added to the service twice a month, so this is essentially the first wave of games for June. This time there's a little bit of everything, but the headline game here is certainly Amnesia: The Bunker. The horror game suffered yet another delay last month, but the confirmation of its inclusion to the Game Pass as a day one release is probably a good indicator it's finally releasing.\nFans of Hypnospace Outlaw—which is also returning to the Pass this wave—will be happy to see the next title in the Hypnospace universe on the Game Pass day one.

The Like a Dragon developer has announced it will be hosting a new studio show, the RGG Summit Summer 2023, on June 15.\nThe show will go live at 8 p.m. PT / 11 p.m. ET on June 15, on both the Sega YouTube and Twitch channels. No word yet on how long the stream will be.\nhttps://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1662792394733961217\nAs for what they'll have in store, it sounds like a few updates. Via a press release, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio plans on sharing updates about upcoming titles, as well as community efforts and developer discussions.\nThe future of Like a Dragon\nWe already have some inkling of what's in store for the Like a Dragon series, or Yakuza as those in the west previously knew it. Last year, RGG Studio confirmed that Like a Dragon 8 is in development, with a 2024 target. Both Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga are set to play leading roles in the game, too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJhqN7R_oAg\nMeanwhile, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name looks to be a side-story telling the story of what happened to Kiryu in-between the past games and new. While he made an appearance in Yakuza: Like a Dragon (Like a Dragon 7), there are still some gaps to fill between the end of the sixth game and the upcoming eighth entry. It's currently aiming for a 2023 launch, too.\nWe also got the remaster of Like a Dragon: Ishin! earlier this year, a solid historical brawler that finally brought the tale to the west. There's certainly some games for RGG to show off at this showcase, amid all the hubbub of June's gaming news. We'll see what RGG is planning for the future on June 15.\nThe post Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is hosting a new RGG Summit in June appeared first on Destructoid.",

For one thing, it’s coming July 26, which (checks watch) is pretty soon.\nOriginally released in 2021, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the continued version of the eponymous Lombax and his robot companion. I didn’t play it, but Destructoid’s resident fancypants Chris Carter gave it a pretty glowing review. I didn’t own a PS5 at the time, but since getting one, it’s been on my list to circle back to it. I just haven’t yet. I really just want to play as that lady-Lombax. She seems really cool.\nhttps://youtu.be/i_jZ3BV6Adc\nMaybe I will get around to it now that it’s coming to PC. The port boasts “ultra-wide support for 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9 (triple monitor support) resolutions!” for those of you with more desk space than I do. However, I have a pretty classy graphics card, so I’ll be able to benefit from unlocked frame rates, ray-traced reflections, and shadows in exteriors.\nOn top of that, there are some fancy image and performance options like “NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, Intel XeSS and Insomniac Games’ Temporal Injection. NVIDIA Reflex and image quality-enhancing NVIDIA DLAA are also supported.” Plus, it supports the features of the DualSense controller.\nThat’s it, that’s what I’ve got for you. You can double-check the Steam page right here yourself. It's also headed to the Epic Games Store, and those who pre-purchases can get early access to the Pixelizer weapon and Carbonox armor (which are also achievable in-game).\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart is currently available on PS5, but you can get it on PC starting July 26, 2023.\nThe post Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart comes to PC on July 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Representing just one slice of the SH rejuvenation, this teaser gives a brief taste of things to come. Unlike the other projects, Ascension is going to be an interactive experience, produced in conjunction with J.J. Abrams' production company Bad Robots. The fact that it's being co-developed by the Dead by Daylight team should intrigue a few people.\nThe trailer itself does suggest that the game may depart from what fans have come to love about the iconic, yet criminally dormant, survival horror series. That's not surprising, seeing as Ascension is pretty much a spin-off. However, the fact that you'll get to influence the story directly should be enough of a pull. In any case, some of you are probably still pinching yourself that Silent Hill is finally coming back.\nhttps://youtu.be/hxBuL8lU3Bs\nNot since 2012's Book of Memories has there been a new entry, so it was a pleasant shock when, in November 2022, Konami announced a multitude of games under the SH umbrella. While such projects as Silent Hill f, with its creepy Japanese flavor, and Townfall are ones to look out for, the one that's on everyone's watch list is the remake of the 2001 masterpiece Silent Hill 2. This reimagining is being helmed by Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team. Make of that what you will.\nOn top of games, there's also a new Silent Hill movie in production, which is being directed by Christophe Gans who did the 2006 adaptation. Essentially, it's all go for Konami's legendary horror series. Silent Hill: Ascension is currently in development, and is scheduled for release in 2023.\nThe post The new Silent Hill: Ascension trailer has creepy horror movie vibes appeared first on Destructoid.",

We’re grateful to our fantastic community for your support thank you for your passion for our games, it continues to drive us.\"\nThe referenced \"brand new single-player experience\" is something of a whispered announcement, and seemingly represents a second Last of Us project in the works at the Santa Monica developer. I doubt very much that they are openly referring to the inevitable The Last of Us Part III, but perhaps there is a VR project or some other spin-off in the works.

          "description": "Who knew slaying demons could be finger-licking good?\nAfter Activision Blizzard and KFC partnered up to offer beta codes in exchange for chicken sandwiches, rumors started circulating that the partnership would continue with the actual release of Diablo 4. It turns out those rumors were true after all. The promotion appears to be similar to the one offered a couple of months ago that gave access to the beta.\nBasically your purchase of a chicken sandwich — by itself or as part of a combo — via the KFC website or through the official KFC app will grant you a code. You can then link your KFC account with your Battle.net account and redeem the code. After redeeming you can then select one of five Diablo 4 KFC cosmetic rewards.\nAlthough pricing varies by location, it looks like the cheapest item that qualifies for the promo is the classic chicken sandwich. At $4.99, this means you would need to spend about $25 (plus tax) in order to get enough codes to unlock all five of them.\nWhat are the Diablo 4 KFC Cosmetic Rewards?\nA couple of weeks ago the graphics for the five rewards were datamined and posted on Reddit.\nAll five of the rewards appear to be cosmetics for various weapons. Though the names for all the items appear to reference KFC in some way, the actual cosmetics themselves seem ordinary. None of them look too out of place in terms of graphical style. That being said, they also look quite...plain.\nIn my opinion, none of the weapon skins look interesting enough to me to bother going out of my way to get a chicken sandwich to redeem it. They all look quite simplistic and, honestly, I saw much better weapons within the first hour of the game.\nWe already know the battle pass will be full of cosmetics, likely better-looking ones than this promo.\nDiablo 4 launches June 5 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox. Owners of the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition can enter early access from June 1.\nThe post Diablo 4 KFC Cosmetic Rewards program revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fury's corpse was rushed to the laboratory of the moral-free Dr. Abel, who wished to experiment on reanimated bodies for the purpose of future warfare. Now essentially a reanimated half-cyborg, Bryan's mind is all but completely lost, creating a sociopathic weapon capable of incredible destruction without as much as a raised eyebrow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0cwK2V4og\nFury's new trailer reveals that our favourite zombie's hard-hunting punches and trademark backfists are in full effect, along with his capabilities for superhuman feats of strength, defying the power of his Actually Alive brethren. Of course, Fury's penchant for maniacal laughter rings through the entire trailer, because if you can't have a good ol' chuckle when you're dead, when can you?\nBryan Fury's trailer was, unfortunately, leaked a little ahead of schedule, upsetting Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada. But the preview finally got its official debut at the climax of this weekend's Combo Breaker tournament in Illinois, where the madman's return was welcome by the Tekken faithful.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, Asuka Kazama, Leroy Smith, Lili Rochefort, and Hwoarang.\nThe post The maniacal Bryan Fury is next to join the Tekken 8 roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

But, inarguably, it was the 1991 arrival of Capcom's Street Fighter II that truly popularised the one-on-one fighter on a global basis, reinventing competitive gaming, garnering millions of sales in the arcade and home market, and galvanizing itself as one of the premier franchises in history.\nStreet Fighter II wrote the blueprint that would be followed by every franchise eager to raise fists and feet in its wake.

Even as a fan of Nightdive Studio’s work on game preservation, I wasn’t sure they could pull it off. Normally, their approach is to simply port games to modern hardware, sometimes fully transplanting them to their Kex Engine. Fully remaking a game, though? Hm.\nIt’s not that System Shock isn’t in need of a remake, either. Much like many PC games of its time, it’s extremely unfriendly. It’s not necessarily a difficult game, but the learning curve isn’t just steep; it’s also covered in dish soap and broken glass. Even Nightdive’s previous System Shock: Enhanced Edition doesn’t really manage to soften its disposition.\nHowever, System Shock’s obtuse systems also served a greater purpose. Even today, …",

However, it won't be available to all-komers, nor will you won't be able to download it straight away.\nHow to gain access to the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test\n[caption id=\"attachment_382319\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nInterested parties cannot sign up for the Stress Test via their PlayStation or Xbox consoles. Instead, you'll need to go to WB Games' website on your PC to perform this task. Log in to your WB Games Account or create a new one. After signing in, you'll be given the opportunity to select an Xbox Series X/S or PS5 code. If you're selected, a code should be emailed to you.\nYes, the beta will not be available on PC or the Nintendo Switch. It makes sense as both of these versions are being developed by separate studios QLOC, Shiver Entertainment, and Saber Interactive. Thankfully, you won't need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold subscription in order to take part in the test.\nIs the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test a beta?\nPublisher WB Games has said this stress test shouldn't be considered a beta. \"The purpose is to deliberately stress our online infrastructure and identify potential issues ahead of the game’s launch,\" said WB Games in an official Q&A. \"The test is also unrelated to the Mortal Kombat 1 Pre-Order Beta that has been announced for August 2023.\"\nIf you don't want to play Mortal Kombat 1 until it's fully released, you'll have to wait until September 19. You can test your might on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store). A PS4 and Xbox One release is not currently scheduled. If you want to get back into Mortal Kombat earlier than that, the prior entry is available on Xbox Game Pass\nThe post How to sign up for Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test appeared first on Destructoid.",

Choosing the name Cyber Citizen Shockman to differentiate it from the 1992 Tuborgrafx-16 title, Shockman, it feels as though it came out of nowhere.

There's a new method to easily acquire legendary shards in Destiny 2, and odds are it'll be gone before the weekend.\nWant to get infinite shards in Destiny 2? Well, then this is what you have to do\nMeet up with Ikora at The Tower, and take one of the exotic quests. Any will do the trick, so maybe get the first one.\nFollow the quest steps until the fourth step. No more, no less.\nHead back toward Ikora, talk to her, then get away from her without taking the armor.\nOpen the menu and chose to abandon the quest.\nTalk to her again, and congrats, you'll now be able to take infinite pieces of exotic armor.\nNow you just have to dismantle the exotic pieces of armor until you get tired of being rich or Bungie fixes the leaky golden fountain.\nYou'll get legendary shards each time you dismantle something, and you can keep doing it constantly. Youtuber Divide managed to blow this wide open, and you can watch their tutorial on how to use the glitch below:\nhttps://youtu.be/x5KDoBoUh9Y\nBungie will surely make short work of this bug very soon, so we highly recommend you check out this sweet early summer gift as soon as you can.\n[Update: Some players are reporting that there was a quick server-side fix that kicked them out of the game at roughly 6PM ET.

On one hand, you likely want to appeal to the fans of the series, and on the other, you want to attract new players.

Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.\nIn this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.\nSilent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. \nSilent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. \nI also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? \n“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. \n“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”\nLike Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward game in the mainline series’ history, and while it’s been a point of contention between players excited for this and fans of the franchise who yearn for something turn-based, it’s hard to deny the combat looks flashy and fun. And as someone who’s played a few hours of the game, I can say it is. \nWhile I attribute most of that to how great it feels to control Clive, it turns out there might be some tricks developer Creative Business Unit III learned developing Final Fantasy XIV’s action to make FFXVI’s combat feel even more satisfying beyond the actual gameplay. \n“For example, in boss battles, when you have an attack and you may see certain areas on the ground that light up to show that’s where the attack’s going to be, that’s something you might…",

The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. \nI was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. \n“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.\nThis second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.\nYou can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.\n\nI was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.\nIn addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9.

Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. \nThis hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI.

          "description": "When discussing Final Fantasy XVI’s combat or watching gameplay, it’s hard not to think about other action combat games, such as Capcom’s Devil May Cry series. And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. \nWhile the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs.

          "description": "Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. \nNavigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.\n\nEach of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAnd, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nDays of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.",

Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points.

At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.\nThe single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, \"Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5,\" with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.\nUpdate: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on the page.\nMetal Gear\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake\nMetal Gear Solid (Including VR Missions/Special Missions)\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (HD Collection version)\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (HD Collection version)",

Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. \nThe trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. \nAlan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer.

That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.\nIn the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.\nSword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.",

According to a YouTube description, Phantom Blade 0 is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you play as the Dark Raider, out for revenge against \"The Order.\" Additionally, the voiceover twice asks a disembodied character what they will do with what little time they have left. Specifically, 66 days. Their response is to get their heart back.\nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nNo release information was given.\nPhantom Blade 0 is being developed by Cruel Man Studio, based in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. The studio was founded in 2019, and thus far, has worked with Tencent and Square Enix.",

After that, I check my map to see how much I had covered in the area I was permitted to explore – it was about an eighth, which is to say these zones are massive.

          "description": "When Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was announced in September 2021, it showed off various elements that got players frothing at the mouth for the sequel to one of the greatest superhero games of all time. While seeing Venom emerge from the shadows was extremely exciting, the bulk of the trailer showcased Peter Parker and Miles Morales working side by side to take down several goons in the streets of New York.\nThat in itself was merely an eyebrow-raising affair, but it's hardly confirmation of cooperative play. However, when Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter responded to a SacAnime panel question about whether or not Spider-Man 2 is a co-op game or not with, \"I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so,\" that added fuel to the fire. \nYesterday, when a Twitter user asked if the speculation and rumors were true, Insomniac Games unexpectedly jumped in to clear the air. \"Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!,\" the tweet from the official Insomniac Games account said. This seems to fully debunk the speculation from fans and comments from Jeter, and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will follow in the footsteps of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales in being a fully single-player experience.\nNope! It is an epic single-player adventure!\nMay 22, 2023\nThis isn't the first time a Spider-Man 2 voice actor has seemingly confirmed details about the game without the permission of the studio or PR team. Back in March, Venom voice actor Tony Todd announced to the world through his Twitter account that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is expected to launch in September of this year, with commercials starting to appear in August. While we are still waiting to see if that pans out better than Jeter's comments about co-op, Todd has since deleted the original tweet. \nWith a PlayStation Showcase set to air tomorrow, we might not have long to wait to learn more. For now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 later this year.\n[via IGN]",

For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now!
