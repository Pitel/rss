          "description": "Renaissance, man.\nListen. We've already reviewed Obsidian's superlative Pentiment over on our sister site Pure Xbox, where we gave it an excellent 9/10 score. However, now that we've been given the opportunity to return to 16th-century Bavaria all over again in this fantastic Switch port, we daresay it's better — worthy of a slight amendment to that scoreline, even. Ahhhhh, now, that's much better.\nYes, Pentiment pretty much blew us away when it first arrived back in November of 2022. At its core a very clever and utterly absorbing medieval murder mystery, the hook here comes through a unique style and setting that results in one of the freshest and most original games we've played this gen. In fact, this one — previously an Xbox exclusive — is a real highlight of Microsoft's Game Pass service, so it's incredibly exciting to see it arrive on Nintendo's console in such fine form.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Sweet little mystery dungeon.\nIt’s nearly guaranteed that during any online discussion about a game of the ‘rogue’ genre, at least one sweaty person will eagerly emerge from the woodwork to say, “Well, ackshually, this game is a roguelite, not a roguelike.” Eyerolls aside, the distinction isn’t without merit, though ‘pure’ roguelikes are relatively rare these days despite the popularity of many of their mechanics in modern games. Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island—the latest mainline release in the long-running Mystery Dungeon franchise—is a roguelike, and it unashamedly features all the thrilling randomization and savage brutality that you could expect of one. We’re happy to report that it executes on its unflinching design brilliantly, providing a tough, engaging, and addictive experience that you won’t want to miss (if you like roguelikes).\nThe narrative of Shiren '6' follows the titular wanderer and Koppa, a talking ferret who accompanies him on his adventures. The two of them both received visions in a dream about a mysterious treasure lying in the stomach of a powerful beast on Serpentcoil Island, so they head there to see if the legends are true. In a rather interesting twist, we then jump forward to the very end of their adventure, right in the middle of their climactic battle with the monster. Shiren takes a blow to the head during the fight that gives him amnesia and though he and Koppa fight bravely, they’re eventually overwhelmed by the creature and awaken in a nearby village. Eager for another crack at the beast, and in an attempt to jog his foggy memory, Shiren and Koppa set out again to retrace their steps and, hopefully, succeed.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has marked the 8th birthday of his farming sim phenomenon baby (also called Stardew Valley) by announcing the impending release of update 1.6. The PC version - the one we care about - is arriving on the 19th of March, and consoles and mobile as soon as possible after that. The actual content of update 1.6 is largely a mystery, but Barone has teased a few things here and there, including that it's \"mostly changers for modders\" that'll make it \"easier and more powerful to mod\". \nRead more",

A couple of weeks ago, it was \"I refuse to leave the prologue area in Skull And Bones\", a decision that has sadly been born out by Ed's review. Then it was \"I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter\", which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it's \"I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn't one\".

I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.\nI'm worried about Dragon Age. I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking. What I'd like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon's (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.\nRead more",

This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”\nSunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you'll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur's Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It's a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively \"provincialises\" the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Or until you hold down the power button.\nThis crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re \"not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch,\" after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.\nRead more",

I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble's Age Of Mythology.\nI'm not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn't even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn't bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren't for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here's a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.\n Read more",

          "description": "Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.\nIt's also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you're off the clock, it's time to pick up the game's wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.\nRead more",

          "description": "Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It's a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.\nThe original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I'm pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there's good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.\nRead more",

It's hard to miss, because the entire screen fills up with rows of damage numbers beaming down onto your hapless little spaceship.\nRead more",

You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it's less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there's a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it's in 1.0. If you haven't yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it's very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.\nRead more",

He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days.

          "description": "Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.\nRead more",

Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is \"cautious\" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.\r\n \nRead more",

In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  \nComposed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.\nRead more",

          "description": "By default the AArch64 kernel on Ubuntu and other Linux distributions tend to default to a standard 4K page size but for newer AArch64 hardware especially in the server/HPC space, there can be great benefits to using a 64K page size. As it's been a while since I last ran any 64-bit ARM 4K vs. 64K kernel page size benchmarks, while having remote access to the NVIDIA GH200 I ran a fresh comparison for looking at the performance advantages to switching over to a 64K page size kernel. These new 64K kernel numbers are shown alongside the recent AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon CPU reference benchmark results for a look at how the 4K vs. 64K page size affects the overall computing landscape.",

The creators of the game answered questions from fans in a Reddit AMA on February 27, and as one might expect, plenty wanted to know more about Initiation 4: We Sing. They got their answers from Nathalie Jankie, Marko Muikku, and John Crossland.\n\n\nChucking a musical sequence into a survival horror game is unconventional, but Remedy managed to pull it off, with Sam Lake and Ilkka Villi pulling off their best moves to the sound of the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard.

          "description": "If you haven't played Black Mesa, the unofficial (yet wholly endorsed by Valve) remake of Half-Life, it's definitely worth checking out. For those of us who have played – and enjoyed – it, the team responsible for it is teasing a new game that's currently in the pipeline.\n\n\nA video uploaded to YouTube by developer Crowbar Collective (thanks, GamesRadar) gives us just 22 seconds of something the studio is working on. All we get is the company logo followed by a colorful symbol that leaves us non the wiser. And that's it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep up-to-date with what the developer is working on, you're encouraged to sign up to the mailing list. Suffice it to say, it's impossible to know what the project is, but I bet you'll have your own theories.\n\n\nIt's probably not Half-Life 3\n\n\nIt could be a brand-new IP from Crowbar Collective. However, for all we know, it could be another remake. Perhaps of the sequel or some other classic FPS. Who knows? Not I, that's the point I'm making.\n\n\nAs for Black Mesa, it was in development for years before it finally came out in an official capacity in 2020. It rebuilds the original Half-Life from the ground up, complete with fresh voice acting.\n\n\nIt also tinkered with the OG a little bit. In order to keep diehard fans on their toes, some parts were tweaked or changed in certain respects. It also improved on the Xen aspect of the game, which some feel was lacking somewhat in Half-Life. Again, worth checking out if you're a fan of the original.\n\nThe post Studio behind the Half-Life remake Black Mesa teases a new project appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When the end of the world comes (and it will), I like to imagine that in the midst of all the rubble and chaos, people will still be playing Skyrim. There doesn't seem to be any way that people won't tinker with the game and in this instance, we get to see dead technology being revived in order to play TES5.\n\n\nAs spotted by PCGamesN, Reddit user nekomichi recently showed that it's possible to run the game in a Steam Deck (so far so normal) using old iPods as controllers. The clip attached to the post shows it working as you would imagine.\n\n\n\n\nMovement itself requires scrolling the click wheel of the one on the right, while the left iPod is being used for turning. While walking forward and fighting seem to work pretty well, turning left and right is a bit of a janky affair.\n\n\nNot intended for speedruns\n\n\nThis idea is actually based on something nekomichi did in November 2022. A video on YouTube shows them setting up some iPods to control Skyrim via PC. Basically, it involves the installation of RockBox, an open source piece of firmware which allows the iPods to be used as devices over a USB.\n\n\nOnce installed, it becomes a case of assigning each button and wheel to an action in-game. The method used in the video is almost certainly the same that's used in the Steam Deck version (what is a Steam Deck if not a portable PC, after all).\n\n\nThey've also tested this on Sleeping Dogs, also running on the Deck. However, they say it works much better with Skyrim. There's no reason why you can't try this yourself if you happen to have some old iPods flying around. But don't expect to be speedrunning through the game.\n\nThe post Here’s Skyrim on a Steam Deck, controlled by iPods appeared first on Destructoid.",

During today's Pokemon Presents, the company revealed Pokemon Pocket, an upcoming new way to enjoy the trading card game. \n\n\nAlthough Pokemon TCG Online already exists, Pokemon TCG Pocket will introduce new elements that'll appeal to players who aren't particularly invested in the competitive side of things and take more delight in the artwork of the cards. \n\n\nThe game will allow you to open digital packs and feel the excitement of discovering what new cards you can add to your collection on your mobile device. On your hunt for your favorite cards, you'll also be able to trade with other players also hoping to perfect their collection. \n\n\nExperience Pokemon TCG like never before\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe upcoming game is being developed via a three-way collaboration with Creatures Inc., the Pokemon Company, and DeNA which a company also involved with Pokemon Masters EX.\n\n\nAccording to the CEO of Creatures Inc., Yuji Kitano, care is being taken to show off the cards with effects only available digitally. One of the ways this is being done is through an immersive experience that lets you leap into the illustrations, which should be a blast when applied to full art and rare cards.  \n\n\n\n\nThe competitive element of Pokemon TCG hasn't been eliminated, and you'll still be able to battle with friends. However, Kitano explains that the rules have been streamlined to allow for quick battles. \n\n\nWe don't have details regarding any monetization strategies, though it is revealed that you'll be able to open two packs a day for free. It launches in 2024, so TCG fans should prepare for the all-new experience coming soon. \n\nThe post Pokemon TCG goes digital again with Pokemon TCG Pocket appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After more than two weeks of hammered servers and lengthy queues, Helldivers 2 players and developer Arrowhead have a reason to collectively sigh in relief. Helldivers 2 server issues seem to have finally let up during the weekend, and now the studio is ready to go back to the \"original plan\" and prep new content.\n\n\nThat's not to say that the weekend was quiet, oh no. Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt predicted on X (Twitter) that divers would reach the 800,000 player cap over the weekend. It may have accomplished just that, as more than 450,000 players answered the call of Super Earth on Steam alone. \n\n\nOn February 25, Pilestedt wrote he was \"happy and proud\" of the team and that the servers stayed online \"without problem.\" Pilestedt continued by saying it's time for the developer to go back to the \"original plan,\" and that there are \"exciting things\" in the works.\n\n\n\n\nHelldiver 604958, going dark\n\n\nBy \"exciting things,\" we're hoping he's talking about the mech suits. Mechs were teased at the end of a trailer before the game launched. There's no word on when we'll get the suits, but the trailer mentioned they would be arriving \"soon after launch.\" Now that waitlists are hopefully behind us, we may soon see which 'metal boxes with legs and guns' are best between the Helldivers and Automatons. \n\n\nBut that's not all. Before the February 25 message, Pilestedt teased some possible content that could be on its way. In a reply on X to a post about stealth gameplay, Pilestedt wrote he \"used to rock subsonic ammo and suppressor\" during playtests. He refused to elaborate before dropping an Eagle Smoke Strike and disappearing. \n\n\n\n\nWhether you play Helldivers 2 loud and proud or dream of going at it quietly, it looks like all players should have more to look forward to shortly.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2 server woes ease up, encouraging Arrowhead to return to the ‘original plan’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Another Pokémon Legends is on the way, dubbed Pokémon Legends Z-A, and it's currently scheduled for 2025.\n\n\nToday's teaser trailer shows Pikachu running through a blueprinted city, where many different Pokémon are hanging out. Eventually, the text reveals the \"Urban Redevelopment Plan\" for Lumiose City - a central location in the Kalos region, the home of Pokémon X and Y.\n\n\nPokemon Legends Z-A, as it appears to be called, is a new entry in the Legends series and could be an interesting look at the origins of another beloved locale.\n\n\n\n\nLegends among us\n\n\nLegends started off with Pokémon Legends Arceus in 2022, as an interesting side-branch of the mainline series. Transporting its protagonist back in time to the early days of the Diamond and Pearl region, it was much more focused on catching, collecting, and exploring.\n\n\nAnd to its credit, Pokémon Legends Arceus was pretty well-received. Now, especially after the troubles that Scarlet and Violet went through, a Legends game might be a good stop-gap for franchise woes.\n\n\nImportantly, Z-A is not launching until 2025. While it could be an early launch for that year—Arceus was a January game—that still means we're now looking at a year without a new Pokémon entry, as S/V has wrapped its DLC.

Also, in the announcement, they stated that PlayStation Studios London will be closing.\n\n\nThere are two separate statements, one from President and CEO Jim Ryan and the other from Head of PlayStation Studios Herman Hulst. Both are full of standard executive-speak, but they provide slightly different insights.

Things aged faster in the ‘90s.\n\n\nBy the time the PlayStation had passed into antiquity in the aughts, the denizens of Web 2.0 became aware of a Famicom/NES demake of Final Fantasy VII. Since Final Fantasy VII was still fondly remembered and the retro gamer identity was reaching its maturity, this was a fascinating topic of conversation. Just hearing about it took your imagination to interesting places.\n\n\nIt was certainly fascinating to me.

The sheer popularity of games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, and Fire Emblem have cemented as much.\n\n\nMaybe this is my own biases speaking, but hearing \"(insert name here) Tactics\" immediately brings that image to mind, and it's held true for several variations of tactical spin-offs. After playing the demo for Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware's latest, it is clearly falling in the strategy side of the genre; rather than another Tactics, it's hearkening back to a different branch of the Ogre series: Ogre Battle.\n\n\nIt's a really interesting approach to …",

This time, we'll see new faces join the team, from the eccentric Senadina to the animalistic Coralie 6626 Planck.\n\n\nIf you have always wanted to go on a heroic deep space escapade, now is the perfect time to begin as Honkai Impact 3rd kicks off Part 2 on February 29. You won't stray too far from our solar system as the team sets out on a quest to Mars. That means HoYoverse longtime players can look forward to all-new missions, locations to explore, and challenges to overcome.\n\n\nEven those who have yet to play Part 1 and 1.5 won't get too lost in the lore, considering that Part 2 begins a different path. On top of that, every battle will increase the thrill, and you must take advantage of your team's kit to unleash brutal blows to new galactic enemies. \n\n\n\n\nNew combat features head to the HoYoverse RPG with the update, too. The Astral Ring, one of Honaki's new battle mechanics, allows you to collect energy in battle, resulting in more damage rates toward foes. You can also take things to the skies through aerial combat, where you can even land a few gnarly combos. \n\n\nHowever, it won't always be so hectic in the world of Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, thanks to the explorative features throughout Mars. Not only will these travels help you grow as a team, but the sights will be stunning to look at with its next-generation graphics. \n\n\nCurrently, the game is only available for PC and mobile, with Mac functionality expected to come. If you want an early start, you can sign up for pre-registration to get you all set for launch day. More events will arrive shortly after the release of Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, bringing you rewards both in-game and in real life.\n\nThe post Honkai Impact 3rd embarks on a new chapter with Part 2, Mars Crisis, this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Did you halt progress in Sea of Stars in an effort to filet every single species known to man? If you're a total fishing freak, there's an open-world action-RPG on the way for you called Sea Fantasy. \n\n\nDeveloped by METASLA, Sea Fantasy is a top-down game with a pixel art aesthetic that promises an \"Otherworldly Fishing Open World RPG.\" It also says you can \"save the world by fishing!,\" which might not sound quite as chill as sitting by the dock of the bay should be. That's because there's a slightly darker twist here, as you aim to fish for the world's marine life — known as SeaAZ — while kicking off a story in which the end of the world is imminent. \n\n\nSea Fantasy currently has a projected release window set for February 2025 on PC and as-yet-unspecified consoles. While most of METASLA's first trailer is all about fishing, you can get a glimpse at the larger story that threatens to unfurl near the end. \n\n\n\n\nImagine dragons (if you dare)\n\n\nJust how \"epic\" will this tale be? The Steam page doesn't dive too much deeper into what to expect, but did you see those dragons at the end of the trailer? Yep, you just got sucked into a fishing game only to be tricked into going on an adventure! It's a real RPG reversal, or so it seems. What we know so far is that you'll be able to hop on a ship and explore the open world freely, and dive into dungeons in search of treasure. You'll have to avoid traps along the way, of course. Lest you forget, as the devs put it, \"this is not a peaceful fishing game.\" \n\n\nOn the other hand, you could also just catch a ton of fish and use the crafting system to make new rods and hooks. Maybe you'll be able to ignore all those pesky world-saving pleas for a while like every other RPG adventurer worth their salt. Dragons can wait; the door on my sign clearly says \"Gone Fishin'.\"\n\nThe post Sea Fantasy is an Oops! All Fishing RPG for the reel ’em in sickos out there appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, ConcernedApe announced an official 1.6 release date, with this update releasing on March 19 on PC and later on console and mobile.\n\n\nAccording to ConcernedApe's initial announcement tweet, the PC release date for Stardew Valley 1.6 is March 19. He also highlights that console and mobile will \"follow as soon as possible\". In short, while there are no official dates for other platforms, we know the update is coming, and it's coming quickly. \n\n\n\n\nStardew Valley 1.6 primarily focuses on changes throughout both the early and end-game, including new festivals, late-game content that covers all skill areas, and various dialogue additions. It'll also include new items, crafting recipes, villager winter outfits, and a new starting farm type, among other improvements to expand on the game's pre-existing features. \n\n\nStardew Valley's last major content update, the 1.5 update, launched over four years ago in 2020 and featured new additions such as Ginger Island, the Beach Farm layout, and remixed Community Center bundles to add variety to your playthrough. Update 1.6 is seemingly similar in size and complexity, potentially adding more than the previous update.\n\n\nWhile ConcernedApe's latest post reveals that PC players will receive this update in three weeks on March 19, there's currently no word on when console and mobile players will unlock it. If it follows the same timeline as previous updates, console players will likely receive it shortly after those on PC, with it arriving on mobile sometime after.\n\nThe post Stardew Valley 1.6 arrives first for PC in March, with consoles and mobile later appeared first on Destructoid.",

Supermassive Games is expected to lay off 90 employees, just under a third of its approximately 300 person team. \n\n\nThe company tweeted out a statement addressing the upcoming changes and the process it's undergoing to decide which positions are being removed. As part of the move, the company said, “We are entering into a period of consultation, which we anticipate will result in the loss of some of our colleagues.” The company said it plans to “focus our efforts on our core strengths and upcoming titles.” \n\n\n\n\nSupermassive Games is the company behind some spectacular horror games like Until Dawn. The studio released another horror hit, The Quarry, in 2022, the same year that the company was acquired by Nordisk Games, and is currently working on Little Nightmares 3 and a new horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.\n\n\nWorking in the video game industry is never easy, but it feels particularly rough out there right now. In 2023 we saw roughly 9,000 layoffs in the gaming industry. The effects ripple out beyond just game developers, with companies like Twitch also being affected. Unfortunately, 2024 doesn’t seem to be bucking that trend anytime soon. In January alone we saw layoffs and canceled games from developers like Black Forest Games and Eidos Montreal. Supermassive Games is the latest studio to get hit with layoffs, but it seems unlikely to be the last.\n\nThe post Supermassive Games is set to undergo layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s set for Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC.\n\n\nThe press release makes a big deal about Reynatis being set in a “painstakingly-recreated streets of Shibuya, Tokyo.” A trailer was released alongside the announcement. It’s one of the most ridiculous videos I think I’ve seen since the new Death Stranding reveal. It shows Shibuya government police wizards that maybe fight drug addicts.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first things the Reynatis trailer puts on screen is, “Only by overcoming our fear of idiosyncrasies can we free our true selves,” which is just the most pretentious way to say very little.\n\n\nI can dig it. FuRyu, as a developer of alternative games, is a bit all over the place with its output. However, the art design and even the ridiculously over-the-top dialogue and narrative setup all kind of pop. The game shifts from the “painstakingly recreated” Shibuya to more abstract places that, I’m guessing, are dungeons. Combat looks pretty Musou-like, which can be hit-and-miss when it comes to application.\n\n\nSomething to keep your eye on, at least. It does, after all, feature the incredible Yoko Shimomura as a composer.\n\n\nReynatis will be coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC.

Titled Inkborn Fables, the new set brings players to a mystical and ancient world filled with mythological creatures and legendary heroes. Patch 14.6, which begins the new Inkborn Fables set, goes live for PC and mobile on March 20, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nI've had a lot of fun with the current TFT set, Remix Rumble.

Even though the teaser trailer above is brief and doesn't show any gameplay, there are more than likely some hints about some of the things we can expect in the new set. The beautifully painted scrolls depict mystical beasts as well as some pretty fantastical renditions of certain champions from the Runeterra universe including what I'm pretty sure was Janna and Teemo.\n\n\nOh, and you want me to think the Rammus picture on the wall is just there for show?

Though this is more of an industry event rather than a conference for the consumer, the presence of DirectSR is quite exciting.\n\n\nAs the GDC description notes, DirectSR is supposed to be an all-in-one resolution upscaling solution integrated into Windows itself. The notion that Microsoft is working on its own AI-based upscaler isn't new as such, but it is a bit of a surprise that it'd get shown off in such relatively short order. We've seen an OS-level resolution upscaler make its way to widespread gaming audiences with Valve's Steam Deck. In fact, the FSR integration present on the Deck may offer an idea of some of the …",

          "description": "Even though many of us may see Skyrim as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, there's no denying that it's a painfully flawed game. We know this, and that's why modders are always working to make sure Bethesda's aging epic maintains some degree of relevancy.\n\n\nThis mod in particular is pretty simple, but quite effective. As spotted by PC Gamer,  Nexus Mods user wSkeever recently uploaded \"Simplicity of Stalking - Automatically Follow NPCs.\" As the name suggests, this gives you the ability to follow a character in Skyrim without having to do that awkward run/walk by their side in order to keep up.\n\n\n\n\nWe've all been there. We all know how irritating it is that an NPC's amble is faster than our walk, but slower than our run. Well, wSkeever's mod fixes that.\n\n\nEven if they don't want to be followed\n\n\nAs the video above shows, simply targeting a character and activating the \"Follow\" option will make it so you walk a few paces behind them. Instructions say that, to stop following, simply press \"any movement or attack controls.\"\n\n\nYou'll also need to download a few other mods for your game before you can use this one. Outside that, you're good to go. In fact, not only can the Dragonborn now follow people at a comfortable pace, it also works through loading screens as well.\n\n\nOf course, while it's likely you'll use the mod mainly for following quest NPCs when they're escorting you somewhere, it can also be used on anyone, as far as I can tell. I'm not saying you should be stalking Skyrim residents. What I am saying is that it literally says the word \"stalking\" in the mod title.\n\nThe post Finally, a Skyrim mod that lets you match NPC speeds when you follow them appeared first on Destructoid.",

Aside from the fact that it has millions of games in its growing selection, regular sales and events continue to be a mild threat to a lot of people's finances.\n\n\nWith that in mind, the latest Steam event will commence today and, much like the Pirates vs. Ninjas sale that took place in January, this one also pits one foe against another. In this case, the Dinos vs. Robots Fest will have the large, scaly creatures of yesteryear fighting it out against the automatons of the futuristic age.\n\n\n\n\nThat is to say, there'll be some games in the event that cater to lovers of either dinosaurs or robots. Obvious, really, when you think about it.\n\n\nAnd robot dinosaurs, can't forget about them\n\n\nThe above trailer may whet your appetite. As always, we can never be 100% sure what's going to be in each sale, but the teaser gives clips from some notable games.\n\n\nFor example, we get glimpses of Jurassic World Evolution and LEGO Jurassic World for all you dino lovers. Then there's footage from Detroit: Become Human and Terminator: Resistance if bots and mechanoids are more your thing. \n\n\nAnd to bridge the gap, it looks like Horizon Zero Dawn is going in the fest as well. Because in this crazy world, why can't we have a little bit of both?

Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title was very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. \nNEW: As part of today's mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.\nhttps://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe\nFebruary 27, 2024\nTwisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. \nThe number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood & Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it's among several titles getting the axe. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

It is also closing London Studio, the team behind PlayStation VR's Blood & Truth and VR Worlds. In a statement released by head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst, he seems to cite overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs. \nPlayStation's Technology, Creative, and Support teams are also affected by these layoffs, according to Hulst. He writes, \"These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios.\" These layoffs will result in an 8 percent reduction of staff, or around 900 people losing their jobs. \n\n\n\"Our goal at …",

          "description": "During today's Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.\nCheck out some images from the trailer below:\n\nThe teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words \"urban redevelopment plan.\" This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.\nOther than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called \"a worthwhile spin-off adventure.\"\nAre you excited for Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Let us know in the comments below!",

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.\nPublisher Atlus and Vanillaware released it in 2019, so when the team announced its latest title, Unicorn Overlord, last September, it was easy to conclude that this was the studio’s next big focus.

          "description": "During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it's hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. \nEnder Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game's new trailer below.\n\n\nLike Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.\nWhile it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game's benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.",

As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series' music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. \nHowever, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout \"the story of the show,\" SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. \n\n\n\"[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue,\" SanTheSly writes. \"The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I'd gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease.\" \nThat sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word \"repent\" to randomly feature a \"3.\" However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn't the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nDo you want a third Nier game?

          "description": "Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or \"Switch 2\" as it's been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo's next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei's latest reporting. \n\n\nVGC reports that Nikkei writes, \"Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch\" to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo's next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. \nFinally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console's launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it'd follow in the Switch's footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.\nIt's important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch's successor hasn't even been publicly revealed yet, so there's no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year. \n[Source: Nikkei via VideoGamesChronicle]\nDo you think March of next year is a good time for a new Nintendo console?

As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film \"explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding.\"\nIt was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus. \nDocumentary film \"HIDEO KOJIMA: CONNECTING WORLDS\"\n#DisneyPlus starting TODAY!🎬\n#DeathStranding #HideoKojima pic.twitter.com/XOaTi6WuF9\nFebruary 23, 2024\nWe haven't yet watched it but given Kojima's love of movies, we're excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director's Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird. \nAre you going to check out Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds this weekend?

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix's latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it's the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). \nCurrently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.\nThere’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.\npic.twitter.com/8PvD3wfpvZ\nFebruary 22, 2024\nAs you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it's important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. \nStill, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review and then check out our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth cover story hub for exclusive features, videos, and more.

It received middling reviews – read Game Informer's review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had \"fallen short of our expectations,\" as reported by IGN. \n\n\nMore specifically, that's Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady's latest effort fell short of the company's expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League's missed expectations set Warner Bros.' games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.\nWiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company's massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's review of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and then check out Game Informer's list of the best superhero games of all time.

          "description": "It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.\nAs reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,\nThe rest of Neostream's update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nLittle Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console's launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You'll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. \nLittle Devil Inside has no release window but we're hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.",

However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. \n\"[We're] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,\" a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. \"We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles.

While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.\n\n\nThe 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. \n2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game's official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.",

You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

Now, it's time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena's Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021's The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. \nAhead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker's gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. \nCheck out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character's live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. \nPeacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. \nElsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she's an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality.

Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.\nSea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. \n\n\nAs associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.",

According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer's 2023 \"Best Microsoft Exclusive\" award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.\nPentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. \nWhen it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is \"a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.\"\nPentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future.

Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.\nYou can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella's egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear's head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.\n\nThe game's official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game.

          "description": "Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.\nWe’ll let the trailer speak for itself.\n\n\nIn Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.\nSince the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  \nRedemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players.

When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says \"Fortnite Festival,\" implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.\nThe funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, \"what is fortnight,\" either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.\n*fortnite https://t.co/1FwPHmMfRJ pic.twitter.com/9BSG6S23zh\nFebruary 20, 2024\nFortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it's getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney.

I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.\nWatch The Gigantic: Rampage Edition Announcement Trailer:\n\n\nNotably, Game Informer's original Gigantic review wasn't as positive as I personally felt about the game.

We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find.

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost.
