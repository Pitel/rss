We wish we could slay the dragon, overthrow the evil king, or run faster than any hedgehog ever should. Possibly the biggest power fantasy of all, though, is offered by Terra Nil, which allows you to tackle the overwhelming existential dread of climate change.\nIn Terra Nil, you are given a simple task – repair a ruined, barren planet, coaxing plants and animals back to the surface until the world is teeming with life once more. It is a beautifully simple concept that is almost perfectly executed by developer Free Lives. It takes a fine touch to turn one of the most stressful topics in our world into a genuinely relaxing interactive experience, but this is a wonderfully balanced game that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and never feels repetitive.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That might be because I've not had a huge amount of time to play loads outside of review duties and general life things, but there's only been, like, less than a handful of games that have truly commanded my attention.\nOne of said games comes backflipping in right at the tailend of this year: Astral Ascent. It's a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I've not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.\nRead more",

Probably something like 70% of my 2023 games time was spent on precisely two co-op shooters, neither of which I’ve written about much, nor were new enough to be eligible for the most recent Advent Calendar. I apparently have a type. I’m sorry.\nStill, while the man’s rules prevent me from recommending Deep Rock Galactic or Darktide, I do have a few picks that fell short of full Advent Calendar glory. And they’re all... colourful, quite short indie platformers? Hmm, maybe I have two types.\nRead more",

Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they're actively searching for it. But today, we're staging a coup. We're taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.\n2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides.

I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023. I am very pleased with the shape of our Advent Calendar this year, though, especially the mid-table, which has some good weirdo entries and some surprises there.\nSo I thought I'd struggle to come up with three reminders for you for the Selection Box.

Even as the person with \"Reviews\" in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog.

Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box.

At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.\nIn any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.\nRead more",

After playing Skeal got your toe tapping to the beat and your heart pounding with power and pleasure, you're ready to trash Christmas with a catchy tune in Dracula Cha Cha. And after Skeal also prepped you for pain, oh, here we go: it's Christmas Pain In Christmas Town.\nRead more",

While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.\r\n\n\r\nNotable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster.

The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year.

          "description": "I've recently returned to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, one year after the grimdark Left 4 Dead 'em up launched and eleven months after I stopped playing. It was always fun to tear through the grubby guts of a Gothic industrial megacity with your chainsword, but it became repetitive and its whole loot-o-crafting mess sucked. A year on, the loot and crafting still suck, but I've really enjoyed the variety added by new levels and weapons and the polish from a year of tweaks and quality-of-life changes. If you played Darktide on Game Pass (or bought it), consider another look.\nRead more",

Games where any soldier can receive a horror mark, which attracts unspeakable phantoms from beyond reality to randomly attack them, and if they survive, they'll probably receive more horror marks. Games where I once deployed my entire military against an evil raven so large and powerful that I lost, leaving behind corpses that it fed on to grow even stronger. Games where a frog could, mathematically, kill god with one blow.\nDominions 6 is due out in January, bringing with it changes so esoteric that I'd be better off talking about Dominions 3 to Dominions 5 instead.

It appears Nate is quite unfamiliar with time travel films. We also think up some some resolutions for next year, and you've also got our regular recommendations to look forwards to at the end of the show.

This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too.

The Asus ROG Ally made a (mostly) successful attempt at slimming down while upping performance, and now we have the Lenovo Legion Go: an even higher-concept portable with Switch-style detachable controllers. One of which transforms into a mouse. It’s a bit mad but I’ve always loved the concept’s ambition, even as I rendered working protypes a little less... working.\nI’m happy to report that this, the Legion Go’s retail version, is far more resistant to such improprieties. Moreover, it’s basically the best Windows handheld out there right now – though some occasional fiddliness, and the looming issue of the Steam Deck OLED, mean it isn’t necessarily the finest palmable PC outright.\nRead more",

It's only four episodes long, but it offers a unique slice-of-life perspective of the franchise which may be enough to rekindle the flame of passion for the franchise in even the most disillusioned fans. \n\n\nThe episodes are about fifteen minutes each, so you'll be done with all of them in about an hour. They're best binged sequentially, and though each episode is mostly self-contained, they all have the same relaxed vibe that makes watching the series an incredibly calming experience. \n\n\nThe first episode introduces you to the protagonist, Haru, who's not having the best time in her personal life, so she heads over to the Pokemon Resort to reinvent herself as a concierge. She's expecting…",

While the majority will be ones that most of you will be expecting, there are a couple of surprises in there. Or at least that's what I think.\n\n\nYou can see the full list of top grossing games of 2023 on the Steam website, which splits it into categories going from platinum to bronze, depending on overall sales. There are also different lists for best Steam Deck games, most played, best VR releases, and more.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the overall top sellers on the platform, the likes of Hogwarts Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 were surefire winners.

Sony has confirmed it'll be there, and you'll be able to watch its presentation streamed on its official YouTube channel at 05:00 PM PST. \n\n\nDescribed as one of the world's largest technology events, you'll want to keep an eye on CES to see what game-changing tech is coming our way. This could range from televisions to cameras and other electronics produced by the tech world. \n\n\nThis year, Sony aims to focus on the company's purpose which is to \"fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\" The company has yet to reveal what's in store, though it has revealed that it will be joined by Sony Honda Mobility. \n\n\nIn its announcement of its attendance, the company looks back at its past attendance at the event. It appeared at CES for the first time in June 1977, and since then it has showcased plenty of new technology during its presentations, including the \"world's first CD player.\" Since then, the company gradually shifted its approach to the event, and it is now concerned with \"introducing its latest technologies and initiatives that support creators.\"\n\n\nYou should be warned that this event is not centered on PlayStation, and it is only one of Sony's several ventures. Nevertheless, past CES events have brought us some interesting gaming news. In 2023, we got a look at Sony's accessibility controller which launched on December 6, while in 2022 we got a glimpse of the PS VR2 which hit shelves in February this year.  \n\n\nCES 2024 is set to be another packed event filled with exhibitors hoping to show off their latest advancements. According to the event organizer, there will be over 150 companies represented. Companies that have confirmed their attendance include Samsung, Lenovo, and Intel to name a few.\n\nThe post Sony confirms CES 2024 attendance appeared first on Destructoid.",

It didn't cause too much of a splash in the West, but Famitsu lists reveal that it has been selling well in Japan.

The good news, however, is that the fan-made Fallout 4 project is just a few months away from release.\n\n\nIn the latest dev video diary, narrator and voice actor Drew Faithwaite has given the skinny on where things are at with Fallout London. As of now, the project is pretty much complete, save for some testing. After all the hard work and dedication, Faithwaite is proud to announce that the mod is finally coming out on April 23, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nOur British readers should be familiar with that date, as it's when St. George's Day takes place. Talk about patriotic! There's not long to wait now, and this extra time gives the volunteers one last push to get London ready.\n\n\nOne of the most ambitious mods out there\n\n\nIf you're a fan of Fallout but aren't sure what this project is, boy are you in for a treat! It's essentially a community-made DLC-sized modification for Fallout 4 that – as the name heavily implies – sets things in England's capital city, complete with its own story and factions.\n\n\nIt boasts 90,000 lines of dialogue (more than New Vegas, apparently), new animations, plenty of quests, as well as 15 districts to explore, including Croydon, Hackney, Camden, Westminster, and of course, the City of London itself.\n\n\nThe team sadly had to push the initial release window back due to global issues involving some of the developers. However, things appear to be on-track again and the delay doesn't seem to have hampered the mod too much.\n\n\nCheck out the official Fallout London website for more details about the project. I, for one, am very excited about it. Is that because I'm British myself? That could be part of it, I admit.\n\nThe post Long-awaited Fallout 4 mod, Fallout London, announces release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to @GTAFocal, an account that follows all Grand Theft Auto-related news, the contents of the leak aren't new and originated from the massive 2022 GTA 6 leaks. However, until this point, the data had been shared among private groups alone. \n\n\n\n\nThough some have been brazen enough to post the content on Twitter, Take-Two Interactive is taking down links leading to the leaks. This isn't the first time Rockstar has suffered a leak this year, and just a few weeks ago, we had the GTA 6 trailer showing up before Rockstar intended to debut it. \n\n\nWhile it might be tempting to have a peek behind the curtains to see what's going on with the GTA developers, it isn't the wisest idea to provoke a company that has shown itself to be willing to use the full might of the law to protect its IPs. The teen behind the infamous GTA 6 leak in 2022 was deemed unfit to stand trial and has since been given an indefinite hospital order. \n\n\nWith a confirmed 2025 release date, it won't be long before we get more information on GTA 6 from official sources.

          "description": "Everybody calm down! It's happening! Everyone's favorite sword-wielding android, 2B, is coming to Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising. I didn't know that I was missing her but it's abundantly clear that I was.\n\n\nIn a move that is both simultaneously surprising and not, Square Enix is licensing out one of its most popular characters. It appears that the puppet character, Nier, will have some competition in several ways.\n\n\nWhen is 2B coming to GBVSR?\n\n\nDuring Granblue Fes 2023, Cygames and Arc System Works announced the Nier: Automata star would be joining the fantasy fighter's roster in February 2024 as part of the Deluxe Edition Character Pass 1 or for $7.99 individually. In addition to 2B as a playable character, she'll also be usable as a Premium Avatar as part of the DLC.\n\n\nFor those who don't speak Japanese or want to sift through 6+ hours of footage, a post was made on Twitter (now X), including a 65-second video of the blindfolded battler. \n\n\n\n\n2B makes a rather stylish entrance with Pod following some conversation between the baffled Gran and Djeeta. She then gets to work with both the Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty swords before unleashing a Skybound Art with several Pod units.\n\n\nShe looks formidable with large sweeping attacks, quick-fire attacks from Pod, and teleporting dodges aplenty. I'm certainly excited to try her out as, despite not really enjoying Nier: Automata's story, 2B's design and gameplay completely won me over.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't 2B's first foray into fighting game territory, as she previously traveled back in time to fight against the likes of Nightmare and Voldo in Soulcalibur VI. She was a ton of fun to play then and her appearance in GBVSR looks to be a repeat performance. Whether you intend on playing her or not, it'll be wise to practice against her in the training mode as she's likely to be a popular pick following the release.\n\nThe post 2B is coming to Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising appeared first on Destructoid.",

I bought them some time ago. I haven’t played them. They intimidate me.\n\n\nClassic CRPGs are terrifying. I often say that game design doesn’t expire; it merely changes, but one common feature of ‘80s and ‘90s CRPGs is a wall of overcomplicated UI. The game itself might be relatively simple, but the sheer number of buttons, menus, and functions is staggering. I’ve been stopped while trying to create a character.\n\n\nSo, for the purposes of this article, I decided to finally step into SSI’s D&D world. Not in an RPG, goodness, no. I’m still terrified.

And while I don’t think that advice was totally necessary, I still don’t know how to begin describing the experience.\n\n\nFor lack of a better option, the best way to understand this game is to understand its creator. Astlibra was developed predominately by one Japanese developer who goes by the name “KEIZO”. From what I’ve gathered, KEIZO is not a professional game designer.

Indie Publisher Versus Evil announced on Twitter today that parent company TinyBuild has shut down the company and laid off all the staff. Head of Production Lance James confirmed the closure on Twitter as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Welp. That was a fun 10 year ride. The entire Versus Evil team has just been laid off. Let me be clear - this wasn't a Versus Evil decision or choice.\"\n- Lance James, Versus Evil Head of Production\n\n\n\nLegal issues between the two companies recently ended\n\n\nAccording to GamesIndustry.biz, earlier this month TinyBuild announced that it had settled a legal dispute with Versus Evil's former owner Stall Proof LLC. General Manager Steve Escalante and Head of Production Lance James were also involved in the legal dispute. In the end, TinyBuild paid $3.5 million and legal costs to settle the dispute, and Escalante left the company shortly after.\n\n\nOver a decade of publishing\n\n\nVersus Evil was founded in 2013 by Steve Escalante, who served as Marketing Director at ZeniMax Online Studios prior to doing so. In 2021 TinyBuild acquired the company as well as its QA Studio Red Cerberus. Over the last decade, Versus Evil has published very popular titles including The Banner Saga from developer Stoic and Obsidian Entertainment's Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire.\n\n\nIt's been as rough a year as I can remember for the games industry. This one feels extra cruel as we're just a couple of days away from Christmas and a little over a week from the new year.\n\n\nWe reached out to TinyBuild for comment but have not yet received a response.\n\nThe post Indie publisher Versus Evil has been shut down by Tinybuild appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Japan, Hoshi wo Miru Hito for Famicom is considered a kusoge no densetsu or “legendary crappy game.” One of the worst games of all time. It never made it to North America, but now we can share the pain, as a complete fan translation for the game has been released.\n\n\nThere had been a previous attempt at a translation made by modder KingMike, but it was never fully complete, leaving much of the battle text in Japanese. Last month, user Brandnewscooby released a patch for that patch, which picks up where KingMike left off and finishes the translation of the battle text.\n\n\nImage via Romhacking.net\n\n\nSometimes called Stargazer by Anglophones, Hoshi wo Miru Hito is an RPG that Hardcore Gaming 101 calls “hilariously embarrassing on just about every level.” The RPG genre exploded in popularity in Japan following 1986’s Dragon Quest, and Hoshi wo Miru Hito seems like a pretty blatant attempt at trying to get in on that boom. It does bring some interesting things to the table, including a futuristic setting, and managed to just barely precede Fantasy Star.\n\n\nHowever, every idea the team had seems to have been executed rather poorly. While considered to be somewhat charmingly inept, there are severe balancing issues and incredibly obtuse mechanics. The fact that English monoglots may now be able to understand the text doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to actually complete the game.\n\n\nIt was reported back in 2020 that City Connection was going to release the game worldwide, suggesting an official translation, but it only saw release in Japan.\n\n\nUntil we eventually get an official translation for Hoshi wo Miru Hito, you can find the initial fan translation patch here and the patch for the patch over here.\n\nThe post Legendary crappy game, Hoshi wo Miru Hito, gets completed fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

The hackers then released some of this information, with threats of publishing more if their ransom demands weren't met.\n\n\n“We’re both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it has taken on our dev team. We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other,” Insomniac's release says.\n\n\n\n\nThe statement acknowledges data involving “personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors.”\n\n\nHacks and leaks have been happening in the video game industry for decades. There have even been recent attacks against Sony and Rockstar, with the latter resulting in leaked development footage of Grand Theft Auto 6. Activision was hacked late last year, and it has been reported that employee information was compromised as a result of that, though the company claimed that it wasn’t.\n\n\nBut regardless of the company involved, I feel bad for the employees involved. I’m sure having development footage of a game that isn’t ready to be shown off yet is vexing and disappointing, but having HR documents stolen can be traumatic. Having them leaked on the internet can lead to horrible problems for the people affected.\n\n\nAs for Wolverine, Insomniac says that development is continuing as planned, and the team will share \"official information\" when it's ready.\n\nThe post Insomniac responds to massive hack: ‘We’re both saddened and angered’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

It has announced that it will be shutting down by the end of the year. \n\n\nAccording to the announcement from the studio, a \"lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll.\" Though the company wishes it could continue with its AAA VR projects, it has become impossible to justify the expenses. \n\n\nThis is notable news for the VR community, as Firewall: Zero Hour was a popular PS VR title that had earned itself good reviews. Firewall Ultra was released for the PS VR2, though it failed to impress players as much as its predecessor. \n\n\nEmployees have commented on the imminent closure on social media, celebrating their time with the studio while announcing their availability for new opportunities. They join the ranks of thousands of other gaming industry employees who have found themselves in a similar position this year. It has been estimated that in 2023 alone, around 9,000 video game jobs were lost. \n\n\nFirst Contact Entertainment isn't the only company struggling to master the VR space, with Sony also calling it a \"challenging category.\" PS VR2 players looking for first-person shooters aren't out of luck, however.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Eric Lempel, the head of global business at Sony Interactive Entertainment, reveals how some of these projects have been faring. \n\n\nThough Lempel states that the VR headset sales are \"going well,\" the VR category is still challenging. He argues that \"there was a higher expectation generally for what VR would do to gaming.\" Other hardware benefitted from the Black Friday sales period, including the PS Portal. According to Lempel, PlayStation enjoyed its most successful November ever in both sales and revenue.\n\n\nImage via Square Enix.\n\n\nSony is having no problems selling PS5s \n\n\nAs Sony announced this week, over 50 million PS5s have been sold. This, according to Financial Times, means the console outsold \"Microsoft's Xbox by almost three to one in 2023.\" Lempel comments on the sales milestone, claiming that with prior supply problems solved, the console is \"now on track to outsell PlayStation 4\" which has sold over 117 million units. \n\n\nReferencing data from Ampere Analysis, FT claims PS5 sales grew 65% while the Switch fell 18% and the Xbox fell 15%. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst from Creative Strategies, states that the divergences reflect differing strategies from the hardware manufacturers: \"Sony really cares about selling hardware but from a Microsoft perspective, it’s more about their subscription service.\"\n\n\nSony recently released a slimmer version of the console, and with the right line-up of titles, 2024 could be another successful year for the company.

Some of our favorite indies that didn't wind up competing for that genre's award wound up here, as Slay the Princess, Cocoon, and BattleBit Remastered compete for a spot among PC greats.\n\n\nStarfield is competing here too  — there's no reality in which I'm playing that on consoles without mods, and it seems a lot of us are in the same boat. There's also Baldur's Gate 3, Dave the Diver, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on our nominees list, but Larian's brain tadpoles ultimately win here. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is Destructoid's Best PC Game of 2023. It's one of the games that, even in a year of heavy hitters, stands out as a must-play. \n\n\nOur review, handled by senior editor Eric Van Allen, echoes many of my own sentiments about the RPG as he praises its storytelling, visual scale, and strategic combat. I've spent more than my fair share of time troubleshooting it, especially into Act 3. But that I can still enjoy it this much this speaks to the quality of both what's already there and the continued update support from Larian. Even at its ugliest, Baldur's Gate 3 is a gem. \n\n\nI'm stuck in a constant loop replaying BG3, so it'll probably wind up my pick for 2024, 2025, and so on. The romances are just too good, and when I'm not poking around in Faerun, I'm busy modding it. Either way, thanks to the folks at Larian for pulling this together. It's a special game with a development tale I'm endlessly curious about, and I'm not sure if I'll ever play another like it.\n\n\n\nDestructoid’s Best PC Games of 2023, nominees:\n\n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3\n\n\nStarfield\n\n\nCocoon\n\n\nSlay the Princess\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\n\nBattleBit Remastered\n\n\nDave the Diver\n\n\n\n\nThe post Destructoid’s award for Best PC Game of 2023 goes to… appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.\n“You've never played this?”\nI understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it.

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. \nBetween big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, \"Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.\" You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.\nThe other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, \"Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.\"D All three games will be available to download on January 2.\nAnd as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.\nAre you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games?

During his tenure, he worked on first-party behemoths like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Detroit: Become Human. But today, heʼs talking about a different type of testing involving a headset and physically mimicking movements for multiple hours at your office desk.\nIn games like Blood & Truth, where you take a starring role in action movie-esque setpieces, the fun factor of virtual reality quickly makes itself apparent.

The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.\nFor Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. \"We started off expressi…",

Sony did not comply with the demand and the ransomware group released 1.67 terabytes of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac. \nInsomniac just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here.

A new trailer shows off more of the game’s frosty action and, of course, the series’ signature foul-mouth humor.\nAs the New Kid, players join Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny on an epic quest after a blizzard blankets the Colorado town, and school is canceled. Like the most recent South Park titles, The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole, the adventure is told through the lens of a make-believe high-fantasy adventure, but Snow Day ditches turn-based combat in favor of a more action-oriented experience. \n\n\nPlayers can use different melee and ranged weapons, wield magic and other abilities, and customize their character with various clothing. Snow Day can be played with up to four friends, alongside strangers in online matchmaking, or as a solo experience with A.I. allies. \nSouth Park: Snow Day is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

It said at the time that servers for The Day Before would remain in operation but that the game's future was unknown. Now, the studio has announced that it has officially ceased operations and The Day Before's servers will be turned off next month. \nMore specifically, the servers will be turned off on January 22, 2024. While the game has an emphasis on online play, it could still be played offline. However, on December 12, five days after the game launched on Steam, it was pulled from the storefront and The Day Before hasn't been available for purchase since. Plus, Fntastic says the game will be \"retired.\" \npic.twitter.com/GIX4ZAztny\nDecember 22, 2023\nHere's Fntastic's full statement on the server closure: \nThe Day Before launched into Early Access on December 7. The game peaked at 38,104 concurrent users at launch on Steam but today, that number is down to 55 players, according to SteamDB. In those four days, The Day Before also received enough negative reviews from players to place it into the 10 worst-reviewed games on Steam. \nOver the years, The Day Before has been the subject of controversy, ranging from requests for volunteer work, various delays, broken promises, and more. Fntastic has scrubbed its entire YouTube channel, leaving the following note as its channel's description: \"We're grateful to everyone who supported us during these difficult years. It's been a fantastic journey over the past eight years.\" \n[Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fntastic's statement said, \"Steam will not proactively refund all remaining players.\" The statement says, \"Steam will now proactively refund all remaining players\" and the story has been updated to reflect that. Game Informer regrets this mistake.]\nHave you played The Day Before?

          "description": "Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.\nSince the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.\n\n\nThe holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. \nThe milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. \nIt’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March. We're curious to see what else Sony has up its sleeve as the next year progresses.",

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
