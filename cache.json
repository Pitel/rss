          "description": "Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it's less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there's a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it's in 1.0. If you haven't yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it's very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.\nRead more",

He's got credits on some of the studio's best-loved games, from Baldur's Gate 2 through Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic to Dragon Age: Origins and the Mass Effect trilogy. He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale's launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of \"gravity\".\r\n \nRead more",

Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.\nRead more",

          "description": "Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale releases into Steam early access today. Our pre-launch impressions? Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is \"cautious\" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Every year, there are a couple of game soundtracks I become properly obsessed with. In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  \nComposed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.\nThe boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.\nRead more",

Even ongoing server connectivity issues haven’t done much to spoil the sense of fun, which incidentally, can also be shared on the Steam Deck.\nIndeed, following a quick Proton update on Valve’s part, its previously SteamOS-incompatible anti-cheat will no longer put the kibosh on you dropping into Helldivers 2 via your Deck. I’ve been testing on both an original 512GB model and the newer Steam Deck OLED, and as long as you don’t mind dropping the quality settings, it can usually run tidily above 30fps.\nRead more",

It not only poked fun at the reverential distance enforced on us by stuffy old art galleries, but it also invited us to recreate abstract modern masterworks by clicking, tracing and generally getting up close and personal with them with our big, colourful in-game fingers. Now, solo developer Thomas Waterzooi is back with Please, Touch The Artwork 2, which takes us on a slightly different journey through the art world as a hidden object point and click game. It's out today, is completely free, and was made to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the death of the Belgian expressionist and surrealist painter James Ensor. \nRead more",

Major cards are used at portals to conjure up a particular biome or world type and set the difficulty, including an approximate choice of resident NPC factions, local fauna and resources. Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings. You can lower the gravity for optimal umbrella gliding conditions, alter the weather or summon a Blood Moon (sorry, Zelda) that reduces your max health. \r\n\n \nRead more",

If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. \nIt is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof. \nRead more",

          "description": "I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.\nThis might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.\nRead more",

          "description": "Because it’s somehow my job to worry about the technical fidelity of electronic toys, I’ve been eyeing the long-overdue arrival of Skull and Bones with some nervousness. After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.\nBut nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.\nWhile Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.\n Read more",

Rather, the task here is always to try and save him from his own idiocy - namely, his malfunctioning ship that keeps firing his missiles right back toward him. He's an ungrateful little sod if you do rescue him from certain doom, but I kinda love him for it anyway - and thanks to an industrious pair of modders, you can now have Soggins join your crew to inflict his own special brand of personal chaos on you. \nRead more",

The original tank controls are by far and away the best (and only real) option for going back and experiencing Lara's OG adventures from the late 90s, and I'm not just saying that out of nostalgia. The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs. They are utterly maddening, and the antithesis of everything Tomb Raider stands for. I implore you, do not go anywhere near them, for your own sake as well as Lara's.\nRead more",

          "description": "Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.\nIn practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "By now you'll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games' upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.\nWith so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.\nRead more",

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. \r\n\n\r\nOh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there!

          "description": "MojeFedora.cz informuje, že ovladač Nvidia už není v GNOME Software. Před 7 lety se zjednodušil způsob, jak nainstalovat proprietární ovladače Nvidia do Fedory. Pokud jste po instalaci souhlasili s repozitáři třetích stran, přidal se speciální repozitář z RPMFusion, který balíčky s ovladačem obsahoval. Zároveň byla přidána integrace s GNOME Software, takže stačilo dát hledat v katalogu softwaru \"nvidia\" a ovladač šlo nainstalovat několika kliknutími.\r\n\r\nNyní se od tohoto řešení ustoupilo. Ovladač v RPMFusion totiž není podepsaný klíčem Fedory a tudíž nefunguje se SecureBootem, který má dnes zapnutý většina počítačů. Zmizela pouze integrace s GNOME Software, kde už nyní ovladač nenajdete. Repozitář s ovladačem je stále k dispozici a lze ho doinstalovat přes DNF. Uživatelů, kteří ovladač už nainstalovaný mají, by se to nemělo nijak dotknout. Momentálně se hledá nové řešení, které by bylo jednoduché a zároveň fungovalo se SecureBootem.",

The free Monsters, Inc. content for Disney Dreamlight Valley, which includes Mike and Sulley as villagers, launches for free on all platforms\n\n\nAnnounced on Twitter Wednesday, this content marks the game's ninth update. Few details are shared so far. However, from the sneak peek video shared on social media, we know we'll be exploring the Laugh Floor, where Mike and Sulley work, in addition to a new costume. The outfit looks inspired by the film's intro with colorful doors embedded into the design. \n\n\nThe Disney Dreamlight Valley roadmap for this year is currently on schedule. In December, the A Rift In Time expansion launched. In Spring 2024, more of Ancient's Landing is explorable with two new villagers coming. The community believes the \"vibrant new villager\" and \"very lucky villager\" in the content roadmap to be Daisy Duck and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. \n\n\nImage via Gameloft\n\n\nAfter that, fans believe a realm based on Mulan launches in the late Spring season (with pink blossom flowers being displayed on the roadmap image) and The Princess and the Frog's Tiana could head to Disney Dreamlight Valley during the summer. Lastly, we'll likely have to stop Jafar from ruining the rift in an area inspired by Aladdin's Agrabah. \n\n\nThis isn't the only news we've heard from Disney today. The Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated developer Purple Lamp Studios is remaking the Nintendo Wii's Epic Mickey for modern platforms. It's a neat Mickey platformer that gives you the choice to remove or bring back objects in the world with Yen Sid's magical paintbrush. You'll also meet long-lost Disney characters within this strange realm.\n\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley adds Monsters, Inc. content later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Limited Run Games has announced that they’re going to be re-releasing Hudson’s 2003 Game Boy Advance game, Ninja Five-O, both physically and digitally for Switch, PS4, and PS5.\n\n\nYou might be thinking that Ninja Five-O is a quirky early-’00s localization title, but it was never released in Japan despite being developed by Hudson and published by Konami. That’s actually what it’s called, though it was released in Europe as Ninja Cop. It’s an extremely rare GBA game that now commands an impressive price tag on the collector’s market.\n\n\n\n\nI was considering it for coverage as part of my Weekly Kusoge column, but then I found out that it’s actually a good game. Despite being rather obscure and having a small print run, the critics who reviewed it at the time gave it high marks.\n\n\nJust look at that trailer. You can tell it’s fun to play. Featuring a ninja in the modern world, it resembles 1988’s Ninja Gaiden on NES, but Joe Osugi’s fancy footwork and flashy ninjutsu gives him a more impressive presence than Ryu Hayabusa of that series. According to the Blurb, Joe is out to “protect the city of Zipangu and take down the evil Mad Mask bosses.”\n\n\nNinja Five-O is another in a lineup of games that are starting to come from Limited Run Game’s new partnership with Konami. Previously, they announced Rocket Knight Adventure and Felix the Cat. Given Konami’s history of not respecting their back catalog, it’s nice to see that get opened up. I still have my fingers crossed for some localized Ganbare Goemon games.\n\n\nNinja Five-O is coming to Switch, PS4, and PS5 sometime in 2024.\n\nThe post Rare Hudson GBA game Ninja Five-O is getting re-released by Limited Run Games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'm not saying Minecraft is entirely infinite, but it definitely has the kind of longevity most other games would kill for. Much of it comes down to the near-endless creative possibilities, but also the mods. Mods and add-ons are what keep the gaming world a-turnin', and Mojang has now added...add-ons to the game.\n\n\nOkay, so if you thought this was old news, think again. In a recent post on the official Minecraft website, the Bedrock Edition of the game now has add-ons available in the Marketplace. Mods were typically associated with the Java build (i.e. on PC), but now the studio has made it so you can use them \"no matter which device you play on.\" Or something like that.\n\n\n\n\nWhat seems to distinguish regular mods from these Bedrock add-ons is they add content rather than just replacing. That's according to a response to a question asked by someone on Twitter/X.\n\n\nI'm not confused, you're confused!\n\n\nHere's what the developer says about it. Maybe that'll clear things up...\n\n\n\nAvailable through Minecraft Marketplace, add-ons let you add new blocks, mobs, items, recipes, and other content to both your existing worlds and new ones.\n\n\n\n\nIf you take a look on the Minecraft Marketplace, you can see that add-ons are in their own category. This means they're not the same as texture packs, mini games, new skins, or adventure maps. Actually, why am I telling you this? You all know how mods work.\n\n\nAnd to celebrate these add-ons, Mojang has released a few examples for free. So if you want some new furniture, a pet guinea pig, or to have all the wool in the world (we're all different), that's totally a thing you can do now. With add-ons. In the Bedrock Edition. Which, as far as I could tell, were already a thing..?\n\nThe post Confusingly, Minecraft has introduced add-ons to Bedrock Edition appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For those who already tried the demo for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, there's now more in store. Today, the demo has expanded with an open-world section of Junon for players to roam about and explore. \n\n\n\n\nAnnounced during the dedicated State of Play, the original demo gave you access to the first chapter of Rebirth, with a party of Cloud and Sephiroth in the game’s opening. Now, the new update, “Dawn of a New Era in Junon”, is available for free for the demo. \n\n\nIt follows Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith, and Red XIII several hours into the game as they emerge onto the outskirts of the fortified stronghold Junon. The update is made specifically for the demo and features a small piece of the open world. Within the new section, players can ride Chocobos, use the new Item Transmuter to craft items, take on Combat Assignment missions, and more.\n\n\nIf you played the first section with Cloud and Sephiroth, you'll receive the Kupo Charm and Survival Set in the full Rebirth game. You'll also get to skip the Nibelheim section, though you can still play it again, which I definitely will. Save data from the “Dawn of a New Era in Junon” section won't transfer, as it is special to the demo. Still, fans and newcomers can try out new forms of exploration and use powerful synergy attacks with your teammates.\n\n\nAlongside Junon, the Performance Mode will receive some face-lifts due to player feedback. As reported by the great Steven Mills, the demo will look much better than it did before at 60 fps. While I really enjoyed the demo, there were some problems with the graphics. Fortunately, the upgrades will make for a great time, making now the perfect time to dive in.\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches onto PS5 on February 29. The demo is available now on the PlayStation Store.\n\nThe post PSA: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo unlocks its Junon section today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following the announcement of Pentiment and Grounded heading to the Nintendo Switch, it seems like Hi-Fi Rush is slamming its way onto the PS5 this March.\n\n\nThe reveal arrived a bit earlier than intended, mind. It seems Bethesda's LATAM YouTube channel pulled the trigger a little too early, confirming the game's release on Sony's console on March 18. The video was swiftly taken down. But an official announcement will probably arrive shortly, now that the cat has officially escaped the bag.\n\n\n\n\nHi-Fi Rush is the third Xbox game to head to other platforms\n\n\nAs mentioned, Hi-Fi Rush will be the third game to leave the shelter of the Xbox umbrella. Before the video was unceremoniously unleashed, Pentiment and Grounded were revealed for the Switch during today's Partner Direct. \n\n\nThe move directly follows a podcast last week in which the Xbox team confirmed that four Xbox-published games were heading to other platforms. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer said the change would allow the publisher to \"invest in maybe future iterations of those, sequels to those, or other games like them in our portfolio.\" The podcast was announced after rumors began to swirl that Xbox-exclusive games were going elsewhere and that Microsoft may go third-party only in the wake of rising development costs. \n\n\nAll three games confirmed today were revealed in a report by The Verge last week. The only game in the report that hasn't yet hopped the fence is Sea of Thieves. But with three games out of the four now confirmed for other platforms, we'll likely hear word on Rare's PvPvE pirate adventure soon enough. \n\n\nHi-Fi Rush was surprise-launched in January 2023 on Xbox and Game Pass. The cel-shaded, rhythm-based game became an instant hit and quickly earned a passionate fanbase. We loved it, awarding it the best Xbox game of 2023. \n\nThe post Hi-Fi Rush heads to PS5 in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Palia developer Singularity 6 announced today that the cozy social MMO will finally head to Steam on March 25. As of now Palia is only available via a stand-alone client on PC and Nintendo Switch. The Steam version will also include c ross-progression play and cross-platform availability, allowing friends to play together across the Steam and standalone clients on PC as well as those on Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nImage via Singularity 6\n\n\nFeeling Froggy\n\n\nThose who login to Palia during its first 30 on Steam will receive an exclusive snuggly Frogbert plush reward. The froggy plush will grow in size based on how many wishlists Palia gets on Steam, maxing out at 500,000 wishlists. I wonder how big the scaling can get...if we hit 500,000 do we get a massive Godzilla-sized frog overlooking Kilima and Bahari Bay? I doubt it, but who knows.\n\n\nOverall this feels like the right move for Palia. For a game so reliant on its player base due to its social aspects, it only feels natural for it to be available on Steam, without a doubt the biggest PC platform. Day one cross-compatibility is a big feature as well because, well, who likes losing progress or starting over in an MMO? Being able to continue your progress right where you left off on Steam is super convenient.\n\n\nPalia releases on Steam on March 25. Those wanting to check it out beforehand can do so via the standalone client available on the Palia website or on Nintendo Switch. It is free on both platforms.\n\nThe post Cozy Social MMO Palia coming to Steam next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

To hold us over, there’s a demo available right now.\n\n\nContra: Operation Galuga is a retelling of the original 1987 arcade (1988 NES port) narrative that sees Bill Rizer and Lance What’s-his-face storm the Galuga archipelago to take down the Red Falcon organization. This isn’t a remake, however. While references are made to games in the series, everything is remade and modernized.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, beyond Bill Rizer and Lance Otherguy, there are a number of other characters in the mix. Each one has its own unique abilities. There’s Lucia, Ariana, Stanley Ironside, and Probotector (based on the censored European ports of the Contra series).\n\n\nI had the chance to talk to the game’s director, Tomm Hulett a while back. This isn’t WayForward’s first try with the series, as they handled 2007’s well-received Contra 4 for the DS.\n\n\nOkay, the demo finished downloading for me, so I’m out of here.\n\n\nContra: Operation Galuga will launch on March 12 for Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Limited Run Games will be handling the physical release, and preorders will open on March 1. The demo is available today.\n\nThe post Contra: Operation Galuga is out March 12, demo now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games have announced Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, a compilation of the two online multiplayer games.\n\n\nThe original Star Wars: Battlefront was released in 2004, followed by Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005. Both were largely multiplayer affairs that generally followed the capture framework set by 2002’s Battlefield 1942, but with a Star Wars twist.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, EA would return to the series with the simply titled Star Wars: Battlefront in 2015 followed by Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2017. Video games, am I right? Whether or not these later games live up to the originals depends on who you ask. For those who prefer the classic PS2/Xbox/PC games, having them collected on modern platforms is a good get. They support 64 players online and include all the bonus/expansion content.\n\n\nPersonally, I preferred the Battlefield 1942 mod, Battlefield: Galactic Conquest. It was pretty janky, but being built on top of Battlefield 1942 makes it instantly superior. You heard me.\n\n\nStill, this is pretty tempting. It’s too bad they couldn’t also fit in Free Radical’s Star Wars: Battlefront 3, which was canceled despite allegedly being mostly finished. Video games, am I right?\n\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection will be available on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 14, 2024.\n\nThe post Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection collects the classic Battlefront games on March 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, we got a peek at what's to come for the hybrid console. One of the exciting announcements was that Super Monkey Ball is getting a new entry titled Banana Rumble. The game launches on June 25 this year, and pre-orders begin today, February 21. \n\n\n\nThe latest addition to the long-running series looks like it will be choked full of content. As the trailer reveals, the platformer will feature over 200 new stages, which is more than enough Super Monkey Ball goodness for anyone. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, you can make the most of the Switch's abilities and utilize the optional motion controls. Though there'll be new challenges, you'll also have new moves to help you. This includes a new spin-dash move that allows you to overcome obstacles and create shortcuts.\n\n\nThough the game can be played alone, it has placed a significant emphasis on multiplayer gaming. You'll get to enjoy a four-player local co-op mode, allowing friends and family to play together. Interested in proving yourself to the world? Then jump into the online multiplayer mode which allows up to 16 players to race their way to the finish line. \n\n\nThat's not the only multiplayer mode available. There's Banana Hunt which has you collecting falling bananas, and for some PvE fun, you can try Robot Smash and try to destroy a robot with your teammates. There's even more content coming our way, but further information on that will come later. \n\n\nIt looks like there'll be a lot of monkey business with Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble, but I'm ready to enjoy the chaos. \n\nThe post Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble is out on Switch this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Software and Bandai Namco just released the official gameplay trailer for the upcoming Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree and it looks exactly like I hoped it would. More epic boss battles, new weapons to find and learn, and lots of dying. You know, more Elden Ring. Shadow of the Erdtree is set to release on June 21, 2024, and is even getting its own collector's edition that looks pretty epic.\n\n\n\n\nShadow of the Erdtree\n\n\nIn Shadow of the Erdtree players will follow in the footsteps of Miquella, an Empyrean and brother to probably the most epic encounter in Elden Ring, Malenia. Along the way, we'll confront new bosses and acquire new weapons and armor. There's a lot to unpack from the roughly three-minute trailer, but I'll say this: a lot of the new weapons look like a lot of fun.\n\n\nShadow of the Erdtree will launch with a handful of physical and digital editions. \n\n\nThose who already have the base game can pick up just the Shadow of the ErdtreeDLC for $39.99. However, for those without a copy of Elden Ring, a new Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition includes both the base game and the new expansion.\n\n\nFor those wanting some extra goodies, a Premium Edition is available for both aforementioned editions that add a digital art book and digital soundtrack.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere's also a limited quantity Collector's Edition featuring a 46cm statue of \"Messmer the Impaler\", a 40-page physical art book, and the digital soundtrack. It also includes a voucher code for the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion on the platform of your choice.\n\n\nElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree releases globally on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on June 21, 2024.\n\nThe post Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is out in June, check out the first gameplay now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "March 8 is not far off now. But for those a little too impatient for then, a small slice of Unicorn Overlord is on the way for Switch owners today through a demo, to tide you over until then. \n\n\nAnnounced during today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, Vanillaware's Unicorn Overlord is getting a demo for Nintendo Switch today. Mysteriously, though Unicorn Overlord is also heading to PlayStation and Xbox Series consoles, only the Switch has been confirmed for a demo. Even outside the Direct, publisher Atlus' upload of the trailer only cites the Switch.\n\n\nYou can find the listing, with the demo live now, here on the eShop.\n\n\n\n\nThat may be bad news for any non-Switch owners looking to get tactical before March 8. Good news for the Switch folks, though: save data will convert over to the main game, so no losing any progress you make in the demo.\n\n\nDon't lord it over me\n\n\nIt's nice, at least, to see a demo out for this, and with save data carrying over too. It feels like we've seen a lot more of these over recent years, and for big RPGs, it's an especially nice feature. A good way to dip your toe in without committing the full way.\n\n\nAnd there looks to be quite a bit to commit to in Unicorn Overlord. The latest game from 13 Sentinels and Dragon's Crown studio Vanillaware sees the team tackling tactics, with battles reminiscent of both Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy XII's Gambit system, somehow.\n\n\nIt could be a big game to dig into, so having a little time to check it out now amongst a slew of other demos and games hitting the Switch is nice. If you end up digging it, the full game of Unicorn Overlord arrives on March 8, 2024 for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.\n\nThe post Unicorn Overlord gets a Switch demo today, with save data carryover appeared first on Destructoid.",

As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, it was announced that Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On, the previously Apple Arcade exclusive remake of the 2014 3DS title, is releasing on Nintendo Switch today.\n\n\nI played the hell out of Pocket Card Jockey when it released on 3DS all those years ago. I can remember being pretty mesmerized as I trained up the best horse possible. I never did beat it, however. I remember hitting some resistance that I couldn’t overcome.\n\n\nEverything else about that game is a blur to me. That’s basically it. I can remember cards, horses, and the fact that I couldn’t complete the game.\n\n\nThe game is like if you crossbred the Japan-only Derby Stallions series with Solitaire. You breed horses, then race them while doing card stuff to win. Really, I don’t remember what kind of card stuff, but if you watch the trailer in the Nintendo Direct, maybe you can grok it better than I can.\n\n\nIf my praise of the original version isn’t enough, our old pal CJ Andriesson said that Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On was “already a contender for [his] personal Game of the Year” when it released on Apple Arcade last year.\n\n\nAnyway, I know what I’m doing today.

Two Obsidian games, Grounded and Pentiment, are making their way to Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nAnnounced during today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, the backyard survival game Grounded heads to Switch on April 16, 2024. That's still a couple months off, so if you want something sooner, Pentiment hits Switch tomorrow, February 22.\n\n\n\n\nSwitching over from Xbox\n\n\nAfter a hectic period of rumors and speculation, Xbox confirmed last week that four of its games would be heading to new platforms. We now know for sure that Grounded and Pentiment are two of them; the other two are expected to be Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves, per The Verge.\n\n\n\"We see an opportunity to utilize the other platforms as a place to just drive more business value out of those games, allowing us to invest in maybe future iterations of those, sequels to those, or other games like them in our portfolio,\" said Xbox head Phil Spencer at the time.\n\n\nGrounded is a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids-esque survival game about getting by in the backyard, staying alive against a backdrop of giant ants and such. It's an intriguing game, and I'm curious to see how it holds up on the Switch particularly.\n\n\nBut Pentiment? Y'all have no excuse now, if you haven't played Pentiment yet. This historical murder-mystery was one of my personal favorites of 2022, criminally overlooked in my opinion, and absolutely a must-play if you enjoy good stories, fantastic art, and the idea of a game that grapples with actual, real history.\n\n\nGrounded hits Nintendo Switch on April 16, while Pentiment arrives on Switch tomorrow, February 22.

Pro-Am. For the SNES, we have 1993’s Battletoads in Battlemaniacs and 1995’s Killer Instinct. And on N64 is 1997’s Blast Corps, which requires the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack to access.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s no Rare Replay, but it’s… no Rare Replay.\n\n\nOf the bunch, I’m excited to see Blast Corps on here. It’s a creative title that just smells like early N64. It’s all about demolishing buildings with a plethora of weird vehicles. A truck carrying nuclear devices has lost control and is very slowly moving through populated areas. The only solution, obviously, is to knock down everything in its path. And for bonus points, knock down everything that isn’t in its path, as well.\n\n\nSnake, Rattle & Roll is fine. R.C. Pro-Am is a bit of an NES staple. Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is not the best nor worst game in the series. Killer Instinct is a pretty big departure from the much flashier 1994 arcade release.\n\n\nStill, it’s a great bunch of games for the service. But it would have been cooler to see Rare Replay go multi-platform.\n\n\nThis buffet of Rare titles will hit the NSO channels today.\n\nThe post Five Rare Ltd games are out on Nintendo Switch Online service today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the Nintendo Partner Direct today, THQ Nordic announced that 2010’s Epic Mickey is getting remade in Disney’s Epic Mickey Rebrushed.\n\n\nAlongside the announcement is a trailer that shows off the upgrades. The game was original released on the Wii. To be fair, it was a pretty good looking Wii title, but the extra layer of shininess is noticeable. Starkly, the trailer opens by showing glimpses of the game’s opening (the one in the Nintendo Direct actually shows gameplay). If you’re familiar with the original, it’s very easy to see how things have improved.\n\n\n\n\nEpic Mickey was reasonably well received at launch. It involves Mickey going into a dark, painted world to face off against Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character he upstaged back in the golden age of animation.\n\n\nCan we workshop the title, though? No one says “Rebrushed.” It doesn’t work as a play on words.\n\n\nSwitch is the only platform announced for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, but it’s set to release sometime in 2024. \n\nThe post Disney’s Epic Mickey Rebrushed touches up the 2010 Wii title appeared first on Destructoid.",

I guess I’ll soon know if I should hold off or if I need to pick it back up again before the expansion launches.\n\n\nThe trailer is set to be three minutes long, so it’s not going to be an in-depth look, but hopefully, we’ll get a good look at things.\n\n\nThe trailer fo Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to go live at 7am PST, 10am EST on February 21, 2024.\n\nThe post Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is getting a gameplay trailer tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.\nPentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. \nWhen it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is \"a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.\"\nPentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future.

Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on's first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.\nYou can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella's egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear's head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.\n\nThe game's official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here's the official description.\nThe Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.\nDiscover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.\nFollow the link to read Game Informer's Elden Ring review.",

Grounded, a four-player survival game where players assume the roles of children shrunken down to the size of bugs, is coming to Switch this April.\nGrounded originally launched on Xbox One and PC in Early Access in June 2020, where it stayed until September 2022. This is in line with Spencer's comments that the Xbox games coming to other platforms will have been exclusive on Xbox for at least a year. The other rumored Xbox titles to come to other platforms are Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and another Obsidian game, Pentiment. \nGrounded arrives on Switch on April 16 with cross-platform co-op, but you can also take on the miniaturized backyard challenges solo.

          "description": "Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.\nWe’ll let the trailer speak for itself.\n\n\nIn Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.\nSince the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  \nRedemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. \nRedemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we'll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.",

When I see Patrick Mahomes, Lewis Hamilton, and Eminem all dueling it out in Battle Royale mode, I have to wonder – who is even left to add? Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says \"Fortnite Festival,\" implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.\nThe funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, \"what is fortnight,\" either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.\n*fortnite https://t.co/1FwPHmMfRJ pic.twitter.com/9BSG6S23zh\nFebruary 20, 2024\nFortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it's getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney.

The question has been asked in the past, but it was most recently brought up at a panel at FanExpo Vancouver 2024, according to The Direct.\nThe question was posed to Cameron Monaghan, known for his roles on Gotham and Shameless as well as his starring role as Cal Kestis in the Star Wars Jedi series. For Monaghan, it's not a question of whether he's willing to reprise his role as the character, but a question of the circumstances in which that character would appear.\n\"It would have to be right.

Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it.

They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.\nAccording to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.\nSpencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.\nBond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.\n\n\nThe podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.",

          "description": "It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.\nThe video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. \n\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. \nWith Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). \nWe don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.",

Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. \nThe video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.\n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22.

The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. \nThis is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. \nAmong others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.",

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the \"where\" and \"when\": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.\nWhen the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.\nWhat do you think the future of Xbox looks like?

And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.\nThe developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.\nAfter 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...\n#deadcells https://t.co/CqbNvNXGu1 pic.twitter.com/RAz8OL1SCC\nFebruary 9, 2024\nAlong with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, \"The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!\" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.\nFor more on Evil Empire, you can read Game Informer's impressions of the Dead Cells: Return to Castelvania DLC.",

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating.

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.",

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
