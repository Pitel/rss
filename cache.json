However, developer Natsume Atari has dared to attempt recapturing the lightning-in-a-bottle success of the iconic crossover series by combining those same ingredients into an all-new package: Reynatis. This fresh action RPG first hit the Switch in Japan in June 2024, and is now arriving overseas. We’d like to say that’s cause for celebration, but as enticing as a game that boasts some of the same key talent and gameplay underpinnings from Square Enix’s beloved action franchise may sound, we reckon this second go-around needed more time in the oven.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fragrant Story and Papaya's Path is now available on the Switch eShop and (as you might expect from that name) it packs in the base game and its 2023 DLC expansion too.\nFor those who missed this one when it launched on the 3DS in *checks notes* 2022, Fragrant Story is a tactical RPG inspired by the classics. Created by indie developer William Kage, this short-but-sweet Final Fantasy Tactics-style experience was a little too slight for our tastes at launch, but this Switch release extends the campaigns of both the base game and the DLC, beefing things up to a 10-hour story and a 30-hour 100% completion — not bad when you consider the original lasted us maybe five hours.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Set in a pastel-hued mid-'80s Reseda, California, while locations are rather plain initially, they quickly improve as things progress, with one of the best-looking arcade centre stages we’ve seen in a while.

You can do that anywhere.”\nA QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United.

Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.\nRead more",

It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette.

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\".

I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.\r\n\n\r\nWhat do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass.

          "description": "There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

I had a short go on it, and while there's no chance two hours of hands-on time could give me a full impression of the building game's suite of creative tools, I was quietly pleased with the jungle-themed pool I nestled into the earth.

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea.

It boldly describes itself as a \"Cult-of-the-Lamb-lite, Rimworld-lite, Majesty-like mixed with Black & White with a pinch of Against the Storm\". Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence.

Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest.

          "description": "The Moments mode might not be on top of your priority list in EA FC 25, but it can be a great way to improve your Ultimate Team squad.\n\n\nBy completing the Milestones moments, you can get a Jumbo Rare Players Pack, which is valued at 100,000 coins (if you bought it from the market). You'll also get enough Stars to open a Rare Players Pack from the Moments store, which is usually valued at 55,000 coins. While completing the set can be pretty tricky, an ongoing glitch and a second controller can make your task a lot easier.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Moments Glitch explained\n\n\nThe Moments game mode is a PvE experience where you tackle the AI in custom scenarios. Each scenario has certain conditions in order to complete them and earn the rewards. Some of them can be pretty hard (the last two sets of the Moments Milestones are great examples).\n\n\nHowever, there is an ongoing workaround that lets you simplify the process of completing any Moments you want.\n\n\n\nConnect a second controller.\n\n\nGo to Friendlies.\n\n\nSelect Couch Play.\n\n\nUse each controller to select a side (as if you're going up against your friend).\n\n\nQuit the match.\n\n\nGo to Moments and start one.\n\n\nNow, you'll be able to control your team and your opponents (without the glitch, your opponent will be controlled by the AI).\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you complete the Moments Milestones across all difficulty levels, you'll automatically get a Jumbo Rare Players Pack, along with additional packs as well. There are two Rare Players Packs as well, which can be unlocked using stars from the Moments seasonal store.\n\n\nWhile this method reportedly works on PC, I tested it out on PS5. You'll need to have a separate profile on your console for the second controller. That allows the game to think that two separate persons are playing, allowing for the glitch to happen.\n\nThe post How to perform the Moments Glitch in EA FC 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In the Fall of 2022, Netflix and CD Projekt Red released Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, an animated prequel to Cyberpunk 2077 that became one of the year's biggest sleeper hits. During Geeked Week 2024, the two studios revealed they're getting back together to make another animated project set in the Cyberpunk universe.\n\n\nNetflix's new Cyberpunk project won't be Edgerunners Season 2\n\n\nThe announcement came as a brief but stylish trailer that barely reveals anything about this new project. All we know with any certainty is that this new Cyberpunk project will again play out in the mechanized jungle that is Night City. The trailer's description also confirms that Netflix Animation will be involved, proving that this will be an animated production.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not surprised that Netflix is bringing us more Cyberpunk animation. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was an earth-shattering success, so much so that Cyberpunk 2077's 1.6 and 2.0 Patches added a plethora of Easter Eggs and references to it. I've binged the series three times since 2022, and I'm still reduced to a sobbing mess by the time I reach the last episode.\n\n\nUnfortunately, whatever this new Cyberpunk series (or film) ends up being, it won't be a continuation of Cyberpunk Edgerunners. CDPR confirmed long ago that they had no plans to produce a second season of Cyberpunk Edgerunners, and I, for one, am perfectly okay with that. David Martinez and his crew's adventures ended on a heartbreaking but satisfying note, and it'd be wrong to take that sense of closure away by trying to continue the story.\n\n\nWhile we won't get Cyberpunk Edgerunners Season 2, we've known that CDPR has been planning to make other animated projects set in Cyberpunk 2077's world. Hopefully, this new entry will be just as nova as Cyberpunk Edgerunners was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Netflix and CD Projekt Red are making another Cyberpunk anime appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Famous Bloodborne hacker Lance McDonald just made a very interesting discovery in Astro Bot. While he hasn't found a way to play the game in 120 frames per second, he's found the next best thing: Sony being quietly very naughty. \n\n\nIn a recent tweet, McDonald shows Mister Mosquito's cameo in Astro Bot, then reveals its secretly naughty origins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstro Bot features numerous cameos from PlayStation characters, most of them from very popular games. Mister Mosquito, however, is but a novelty stealth game from the PS2 where you just went from room to room trying to suck blood off of people without getting noticed.\n\n\nMister Mosquito showing up not as an Astro Bot clone but as an actual tiny mosquito in a bloodless world likely had the few people who noticed his presence scratching their heads. Turns out the reason was fan service in the most in-the-know sense of the word. That cameo isn't a mere reference to Mister Mosquito, but specifically to a level where the titular Mosquito has to suck blood out of a woman while she's sleeping in a bathtub. \n\n\nThere's no actual nudity involved, but anyone versed in anime culture will know the exact purpose of including such a stage in a game.\n\n\n\n\nMister Mosquito even passes out, in a hearts-in-his-eyes cartoon style, upon mission completion. We can perhaps forgive Sony for this weird mission because Mister Mosquito is from a time before Bee Movie inadvertently taught humankind about the grossness of human-insect lust. Still, it's a pretty peculiar thing to be referencing right now in a game for kids. Did team ASOBI snuck this reference into the game, or, even better, was Sony trying to celebrate the time when developers put all sorts of lewd Easter eggs in games? We may never know.\n\n\nYou can now play Astro Bot on PlayStation 5 or get Mister Mosquito for the PS4 or PS5 from the PlayStation Store.\n\n\n\nThe post Astro Bot features a surprisingly naughty reference to a PS2 cult classic appeared first on Destructoid.",

This iconic manga, which was first released in 1999, has since become a cultural phenomenon, and the anniversary PV is a heartfelt tribute to the maverick ninja.\n\n\nThe anniversary PV beautifully captures some of the most iconic moments from both Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden, taking fans through key battles, emotional scenes, and memorable characters that have defined the series. From Naruto’s early days as the underdog ninja in Konoha to his evolution into the Seventh Hokage, the video serves as a nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans.\n\n\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, the story follows Naruto Uzumaki, an orphaned ninja ostracized by his village due to the powerful Nine-Tailed Demon Fox sealed within him. To gain recognition and prove his worth, Naruto dreams of becoming the Hokage, the strongest ninja in the village.\n\n\nNaruto, penned by Masashi Kishimoto, first debuted as a manga series in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1999. In 2002, the manga was adapted into an anime by Studio Pierrot, marking the beginning of its international success. The anime ran for 220 episodes, covering Naruto’s early years and his growth as a ninja. Its sequel, Naruto: Shippuden, continued the story from 2007 to 2017, with 500 episodes that focused on Naruto’s maturation and the climactic battles that decided the fate of the ninja world.\n\n\nThe franchise has also received a number of spin-off manga series, as well as movies and video game adaptations. The manga can be read on MANGA Plus and VIZ Media, while the anime is available for streaming on Crunchyroll.\n\nThe post Naruto receives PV in celebration of 25th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",
