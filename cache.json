WitchSpring R is a whimsical, story-driven RPG that follows the story of Pieberry, a talented young witch who’s grown up in the woods by herself.\nAs the name might suggest, Pieberry is a big fan of pies. And strawberries. The story starts off calmly enough, with Pieberry attempting to leave her magical forest home to track down a strawberry pie like the one she ate as a child, all while trying to understand why she was seemingly abandoned by her parents. It spirals from there, with a vast world and vibrant roster of characters, ranging from pudding monsters and lightning lions to witch hunters and celestial beings. It’s a narrative-driven experience, but the gameplay switches from turn-based combat to fun puzzles quickly.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there?

Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view.

Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

          "description": "Our Black Myth: Wukong review hails the game as \"a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox\". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.\nAll that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other \"content creators\" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of \"trigger words\" like \"Covid-19\", no talk of \"politics\" or \"feminist propaganda\", and no mention of \"China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc\". \n Read more",

          "description": "Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update. \n Read more",

And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.\nAh, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.\n \nRead more",

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic.

          "description": "With the Black Ops 6 beta on the horizon, Treyarch and Raven Software aim to increase the excitement even more with its Multiplayer Reveal trailer. \n\n\nThe trailer jams in plenty of new and returning Call of Duty features, with one of the stand-outs being the body shield tactic. You may remember this Black Ops Cold War mechanic, allowing you to pick up a body and use it as a defense mechanism. Black Ops 6 offers this maneuver once again, which will go along nicely with its new Omnimovement.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the body shields, we got a brief snippet of some shiny new toys to try. One, in particular, is a baseball bat melee weapon with a brutal Finishing Move. The RC-XD (Remote Controlled Explosive Device) also makes an appearance, bringing chaos along with it. Both tools were a part of past Call of Duty iterations, and now they'll be revamped in BO6.\n\n\nThe list of returning CoD features from this latest trailer could go on and on, including the classic tomahawks and Prestige system. Plus, the reveal confirms the comeback of the Prestige Master, a mechanic that permits players to reach Level 1,000. Although you won't be able to use it in the beta, it should be good to go by launch day. \n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIn addition to this content, you can look forward to plenty of new features, especially with the 16 Black Ops 6 exclusive maps. The trailer already gave us a sneak peek into the brand-new locations, from the tropics to desolate buildings. It also teases the upcoming Operator skins that may tie into the Zombies Terminus crew.\n\n\nYou can experience this new world of Call of Duty once the Black Ops 6 beta and early access drops. But, if you want to make more preparations, get ready for the COD Next event on Aug. 28 for additional BO6 content.\n\nThe post Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer trailer brings back body shields, bat weapons, and RC-XD cars appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari has revealed Fatal Run 2089, a very late sequel to the very late 1990 game Fatal Run. More importantly, I don’t remember the last time I played a decent, new vehicular combat game. Maybe Gas Guzzlers Extreme or Carmageddon: Max Damage. Quite a drought in games about stapling miniguns to station wagons.\n\n\nFatal Run was a very latterday game for the Atari 2600 and 7800. As such, it was pretty much unknown to anyone outside the core fanbase of those consoles until its inclusion in the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. That’s when I played it, and while the 2600 version just feels significant for the way it translated the game to well-fermented hardware, the 7800 version was fun. Of course, as a fan of raster racing games and car combat, I was set.\n\n\n\n\nFatal Run 2089 looks pretty fun. It’s running on Unreal Engine 5, but I wouldn’t have guessed that. It has the grungy metal look and simple terrain of an Unreal Engine 3 title. However, it does have it where it counts, by which I mean when you land a jump, the camera shakes to make it seem like your car is very heavy. Like in Burnout 3 or Split/Second.\n\n\nThere are corkscrews, 20 tracks, and I spy boss vehicles. The press release promises “branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces that keep every run intense and unpredictable.” There are seven vehicles, four bosses, and you can upgrade your vehicle by picking up (in-game) currency.\n\n\nFatal Run 2089 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch (?) and PC sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Fatal Run 2089 revives the Atari 7800 classic, also vehicular combat appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Indie World Showcase will air first, followed by the Partner Showcase, for a total of roughly 40 minutes, after all is said and done.\n\n\n\n\nIn case the names didn't tip you off, don't expect any news about the successor to the Nintendo Switch here. Not only do these streams normally not focus on Nintendo news (Partners and Indies are both third-party showcases), but Nintendo is outright saying that there will be no mention of the Switch successor.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we expect then? Well, the Silksong faithful are already donning their clown masks. And I mean, we have to hear something about that game again at some point, right? Oh no. It's happening to me too.\n\n\nI expect the Indie World side of things to be full of surprises and, fingers crossed, a \"later today\" drop or two. Those are always exciting to see, and my Switch could use a new indie game or two to pick away at.\n\n\nAs for the Partner Showcase, that will be all third-party offerings. My best speculation is to expect some frequent collaborators; Square Enix, for example, or Marvelous. I'd love to get some more details on whatever Level-5 has been up to as well.

From here, you can select any preset to equip it, giving you a quick and easy way to wear those clothes again if you have to swap them out for any reason.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlongside equipping your presets, you can also overwrite them to replace the outfit with what you're wearing now, rename it to make it easier to distinguish from others, or delete it to make room for another set. Since there's a four preset limit, you can't have hundreds of clothing options to swap through, but you can have a few of your favorites that you can tweak through the regular wardrobe categories.\n\n\nHaving presets is especially helpful if you're completing quests or completing Daisy's Boutique challenges and don't want to risk losing your current outfit. That way, you can wear the mission's clothes or accessories and return to your previous outfit later without searching through each category for items.\n\nThe post How to save outfit presets in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

This thing is a low-fantasy transmog farmer's dream, but as far as where to spend it, you'll be running around like a Kobold without a candle if you don't know where to look.\n\n\nWhere to find Osidion in Dornogal\n\n\nYou'll need to find the ensemble vendor Osidion within the Forgegrounds in Dornogal, located at the location shown on the map below:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nSo, just in case you made your way here without knowing: how do you get Earth-Encrusted Gems? Renown, of course! You'll get one Earth-Encrusted gem at the following Renown levels:\n\n\n\nCouncil of Dornogal: Level 4 and Level 20\n\n\nAssembly of the Deep: Level 4, 15, and 20\n\n\nHallowfall Arathi: Level 5 and Level 20\n\n\nThe Severed Threads: Level 9 and Level 20\n\n\n\nThat's nine total complete ensemble sets from Osidion throughout your journey, and some of them are pretty choice. From full wizard-themed sets to low-fantasy mining dwarf attire, these threads are a nice counter to the flashier sets you'll get via gearing. \n\n\nIt should be noted that Earth-Encrusted gems are Warband rewards, which means you'll only be getting one across your characters at each of the reward levels above. That said, nine is a pretty comfy number, so unless you're a real Trial-of-Style-head, you should have your fill and then some by the end of the expansion.\n\nThe post Where to spend Earth-Encrusted Gems in WoW: The War Within appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Making a lateral pass in Madden 25 might not be your go-to option in offense at all times, but it can certainly help you to get out of a tricky situation.\n\n\nUsually, most plays in the offense either involve making a run with your RB or throwing it to one of your receivers. There will be times when you may have to shift from your preplanned course of action just to ensure that your play doesn't get interrupted by the defense. But if you're someone who likes to take a risk and make some trick plays, the lateral might just be an excellent addition to your arsenal of offensive plays.\n\n\nHow to perform a lateral pass in Madden 25\n\n\nA standard pass, whether it's a lob or bullet, travels forward. The lateral has a backwards or sideways trajectory. Typically, it passes the ball from the QB to one of your RBs, who then tries to dart forward and gain yards. \n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nTo hit a lateral switch, press the LB/L1 button, and your ball carrier will pass it off to the closest receiver. This type of pass is straightforward to make, but there are certain aspects to keep in mind before you attempt. Just like a forward pass, a lateral can be intercepted by the defense if they're close enough.\n\n\nUnlike a forward pass, an unsuccessful lateral switch doesn't lead to a stop in play if the ball hits the ground. This increases the odds of a fumble (which doesn't happen if your forward pass hits the ground). Also, you can make multiple lateral switches, but it's best to avoid doing that.\n\n\nSo far, the lateral switch is a good option after receiving kickoffs and punts. But in those cases, you'll need to run really close to another player on your team before trying to attempt the pass. When I manage to do it successfully, it certainly adds at least a few more yards.\n\nThe post How to lateral pass in Madden 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new announcement gives fans something to look forward to in the coming year.

The arc delves into the backstory of two of the series' most important characters, Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto, during their time as students of Jujutsu High. It also delves into how the two close friends ended up pursuing different paths — one towards becoming the world’s strongest sorcerer and the other towards a tragic downfall.\n\n\nIn addition to the film, more Jujutsu Kaisen content is on the horizon. During the recent JujuFes 2024 event, it was revealed that an official guidebook covering both the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death and Shibuya Incident arcs will be released on October 4, 2024. According to AnimeTV, this guidebook will offer fans a deeper look into the series with detailed setting materials and exclusive commentary from the cast and staff.\n\n\nFor those looking to catch up or relive the series, both seasons of Jujutsu Kaisen, along with the prequel film Jujutsu Kaisen 0, are available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Netflix in select regions.

Ronaldo is the latest in a series of popular footballers whose cards have reportedly been leaked.\n\n\n I still have doubts about the actual in-game stats, and these have not been officially released yet, so I'd advise reserving judgment until the developers fully reveal them. \n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's rumored item in EA FC 25 looks similar to EA FC 24\n\n\nFootballers with similar ratings between EA FC 24 and EA FC 25 will be very common. After all, there are very few names who undergo a drastic overhaul within a year. In Cristiano Ronaldo's case, it's rumored that he will retain his overall of 86. This also means that the Portuguese forward will be a walkout in Ultimate Team once again.\n\n\nHis key card stats are rumored to undergo some changes. His passing and physicality numbers have improved, but the rest are the same as his card in. Of course, it's best to wait for the full in-game stats reveal from EA Sports before we can judge how effective he could be in the game.\n\n\nPersonally, I am expecting Ronaldo to get a slight nerf in his ratings. He has been consistent for his club side, but his performances for the country have been lackluster. He has also aged by a year, and footballers do slow down as they age.\n\n\nIf this rumored card turns out to be his actual in-game item one month from now, it will still be usable.

He is one of the few characters who managed to skyrocket in infamy during his career as a pirate. He has not only got himself recognized as part of the Worst Generation, but he has also been properly recognized as an Emperor of the Sea. One thing big-name pirates have going for them is their remarkable military force. For instance, Big Mom literally has islands of warriors ready to mobilize at her command.\n\n\nWith Luffy's rise in infamy, it's only natural that he himself has a fleet sailing under his name. This came into realization during the Dressrosa Arc, wherein a few of his Colosseum co-competitors underwent a sakazuki pledge to serve him. Despite Luffy's initial reluctance, the Grand Fleet still came in…",

Now, these games are starting to get their full releases and one of them stands out — Galaxy Burger. \n\n\nThe concept of Galaxy Burger is simple: travel the universe opening a string of burger joints to serve aliens (and mecha-cats) their much needed junk food.
