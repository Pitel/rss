We're well into Year 8 now, and we're being served up a series of remakes and remasters of old favourites while Nintendo's premier teams focus on brand-new games for the brand-new system.\nFirst-party-wise, in the last six months we've had Super Mario RPG, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and the Nintendo-published Another Code: Recollection — and we also got Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, Advance Wars 1+2, and Metroid Prime Remastered last year. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is launching today, with Luigi's Mansion 2 HD arriving next month. If you're a sucker for new versions of old classics, you've been like a pig in mud on Switch and elsewhere over the last couple of years.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As such, he struck a deal with Nintendo in which 20-30% of his surplus income would go to the company, meaning that he will likely be in significant debt for many years to come.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You might run into an easy enemy once in a while, but if you decide to take a chance during an expedition and descend a floor ‘just to see’ how it goes, it will not go well. \"Your entire party has been slaughtered.\" Again. This remake of Sir-Tech's formative 1981 dungeon crawler may have had a few rough edges sanded off by Digital Eclipse, but underneath the finery this is the same game that has been wiping your parties for over four decades. There's no such thing as 'winging it' in Wizardry.\nThe remake opens with a letter from the 'Project Murphy' team explaining its aims. \"Our primary goal is to make the original game accessible to modern players while remaining faithful to the original feel and gameplay.\" For better or worse, what we have here is a very faithful adaptation that retains the spirit of the Apple II original. And it's a fine — and punishing — piece of work that might benefit from a couple more optional enhancements.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Turn the Paige.\nThough plenty of Paper Mario fans are eagerly awaiting the return of one of the greatest games in the series at the time of writing, there’s another new game set in a papery world that we’d suggest you pay attention to. Newfangled Games’ Paper Trail is the debut release of the boutique London-based studio, and its smart mixture of creative puzzle design with gorgeous storybook visuals makes for a compelling puzzle experience. Paper Trail is a pretty simple game at heart, but it’s so fresh in its ideas and execution that it’ll stick around in your mind long after you’ve finished it.\nPaper Trail places you in the role of Paige, an intelligent girl living with her family in a quiet seaside village who has aspirations of going to school to become an astrophysicist. Her parents oppose her choice to go to college, however, leading to Paige running away from her family and home towards her goals. Along the way, she uses her ability to change reality to help strangers she encounters, who in turn provide her with companionship as she gets farther away from home. It’s a pretty simple premise, but it’s helped greatly by the voiced ‘journal entries’ as you travel between worlds, which also help flesh out Paige’s tragic backstory and motivations for choosing her vocation. It’s not exactly a ‘deep’ narrative, but it draws you in and lulls you into a sense of ease with its soft magical realism.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.\nAnd what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.\nRead more",

You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.\nRead more",

Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase \"by Ernest Cline\" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.\nRead more",

I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming.

No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his.

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.\nRead more",

It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.\n \nRead more",

It's really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption's sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).\nRead more",

Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.",

However, adding friends isn't as easy as adding their character's display name, as you need a specific ID before initiating the request. \n\n\nHow to add friends in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nBelow are the exact steps to use for adding friends in Wuthering Waves:\n\n\n\nOpen your in-game menu and select Friends.\n\n\nSelect Add Friend and type in their user ID.\n\n\nWait for them to accept your request.\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce your friend finds their unique ID and shows it to you, you can add them as a friend, allowing them to join your world and adventure alongside you. However, unlocking co-op play requires progressing through a portion of the main storyline, so you won't be able to join others immediately. Advancing this far takes around two to three hours if you're playing at a casual pace.\n\n\nWhat is User ID (UID) in Wuthering Waves?\n\n\nYour UID is the unique identifier Wuthering Waves uses to differentiate you from other players. Everyone has a unique user ID, meaning yours will never be the same as someone else's. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can find your user ID by heading into your main menu under your character name. Alternatively, you can see it in the bottom corner of your screen while you're playing the game. If you want someone to add you as a friend, you can send them this ID for them to add. Similarly, if you want to add someone, this is the number they'll have to give for you to send a friend request.\n\nThe post How to add friends in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

Convince Flavio to hand it over, and you’ll meet with the ‘Stache Brothers Red and Blue.\n\n\nTo reiterate, this all happens in Chapter 5. About halfway through the chapter, you’ll find the skull door. Eventually, you’ll return to Flavio who will follow you back across the island to see it for himself. You can then convince him to borrow the skull. It slots into the door, and the ‘Stache Brothers Red and Blue rise from the ground.\n\n\nThe hint for completing this is in Flavio’s song, which he will helpfully start singing soon after the ‘Stache Brothers’ appearance.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe song first mentions Red ‘Stache “landing on his end” three times. What this means is that you need to jump on top of the pillar with the red mustache and do a spin jump (ground pound) three times.\n\n\nYou’ll then need to move to Blue ‘Stache. The song says he’s whacked four times on the belly. That simply tells you to hit it in the face three times with your hammer.\n\n\nThe skull door will then (partially) open. Grab Admiral Bobbery and toss him up on the ledge that opened. He’ll walk in and detonate, blowing the door open.\n\n\nFlavio will mourn the loss of his treasured Skull Gem, but it is quickly returned to him.\n\nThe post How to solve the ‘Stache Brothers Red and Blue puzzle in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll visit this city during the main storyline, but if you've ventured past it, you can fast-travel to the Resonance Nexus and visit the quest marker. \n\n\nAfter speaking to Chenpi, you'll give him the Sonance Casket, where he'll explain the item is and its purpose. Doing this introduces the Casket Delivery service, which, in exchange for Sonance Caskets, you'll receive items such as Astrite, Lustrous Tide, and EXP potions, among other valuables. Each delivery level requires more Sonance Caskets, so you'll need to keep an eye out for these items during your travels before giving them to Chenpi and receiving each reward tier.\n\n\nAll Sonance Casket locations in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nThere are 139 known Sonance Casket locations in Wuthering Waves.

          "description": "Focus Entertainment and Auroch Digital have announced that there’s a (paid) DLC expansion incoming for 2023’s Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. Forges of Corruption will feature new enemies, weapons, and environments, and it’s coming June 18, 2024 to PC and Consoles.\n\n\nWarhammer 40K: Boltgun was pretty far off from being my favorite game of 2023. In particular, my biggest issue with it was its confusing and weak level design. However, it still left a big impact on me. Its weapon sound effects are incredible and being a big, stompy-legged war machine felt great. Despite all its problems, I still felt the need to recommend it.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, I’m definitely interested in this DLC. Beyond giving the developers a chance at highlighting the gameplay with some (hopefully) better level design, I’m excited to see whatever new weapons get thrown our way. To be specific, they’re adding the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher. Boltgun didn’t have a missile launcher already? I can’t remember. I suppose the eponymous Boltgun is technically a rocket launcher already, as explained to me by a reader.\n\n\nThe Forges of Corruption campaign will take us back to Graia, which is a bit of a shame since I’d rather see something that isn’t just one big industrial planet. The new enemies you’ll be facing are the Helbrute and the Terminator.\n\n\nOn top of but separate from the upcoming DLC, Auroch Digital is also adding a horde mode. A staple of the modern FPS, horde mode has you facing off against endless waves of enemies. The horde mode will be free to all players, whether they purchase the DLC or not.\n\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Boltgun is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Forges of Corruption releases on June 18, 2024.\n\nThe post Warhammer 40K Boltgun: Forges of Corruption DLC gives new reason to reload in June appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hellblade 2 is almost entirely a linear experience. Barring some slight changes in how you tackle combat or how quickly you solve puzzles, each player gets from point A to point B in the same way.  That is, except for one specific moment near the end of the game. Here's whether you should help Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2.\n\n\nShould you go with Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2?\n\n\nThis choice appears when proceeding through the Jarnvior forest near the end of Hellblade 2. As you progress, you'll link back up with your companions who are experiencing their deepest fears come to life. Senua partially helps both Fargrimr and Astridr with their issues, but then comes upon a crossroads where she must choose who to help. The one who's lost his way, or the one who fears what can't die by the blade.\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a big choice, who you choose here doesn't affect the main story in any meaningful way. You'll help one of them navigate the forest for a few moments before finding the other down the path, shaken up but no worse for wear. After meeting up with Thorgestr, the story proceeds as if the choice never came up.\n\n\nWhile it is a little sad that neither choice matters, it's likely Ninja Theory just wanted to test your thoughts on who you'd help in that situation more than making you decide who lives or dies. If you had to choose between someone who could no longer fight for themselves and someone who could no longer see the path forward, who would you choose to save?\n\nThe post Should you help Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Unlike other puzzles, you can levitate the pillars and move them onto the blocks, allowing you to see which panels will emit light when you place the pillar. \n\n\nOnce you place each pillar on the Encryption Blocks, you'll unlock the chest and claim its reward. Typically, locked treasure chest rewards include Astrite, EXP potions, or character ascension materials. \n\n\nHow to unlock the Levitator ability\n\n\nIf you encounter one of these puzzles before unlocking levitation, you'll first have to progress far enough into the main story to visit the Jinzhou city hall. Here, you'll meet with Sanhua and learn more about your current situation before venturing off to the next area. Before leaving, though, Sanhua will provide you with multiple character abilities, including levitation.\n\nThe post How to open Encryption Block chests in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Almost every combat-heavy game offers controller support, allowing players to maneuver around the battlefield easily. However, you may have stumbled upon a roadblock in Wuthering Waves, where the feature may not be available. We're here to show you how to play on a controller in Wuthering Waves, including what devices are supported. \n\n\nWuthering Waves controller gameplay, explained \n\n\nAs of now, Wuthering Waves only supports controllers on PCs, not on mobile devices. I've tried it on Android to no avail, producing a mouse cursor on the phone screen with no inputs. iOS users have said the same thing, so PC controller support is the only way to go. \n\n\nSupported controllers for Wuthering Waves\n\n\nWuthering Waves is compatible with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One controllers. Although I've heard some reports about PS4 controllers not being compatible, it did work for me. All you need to do is simply plug it into your PC to begin playing Wuthering Waves this way. \n\n\nIf you prefer to connect via Bluetooth, you can do so by turning on your controller's Bluetooth mode and then searching for it in your PC's Bluetooth settings. Once connected, the game will recognize the controller and switch to controller mode. \n\n\nHead to Settings and select the Keys tab. You can tweak button inputs from here, including locking on a target, dash/dodge, and Resonance Skill. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIt isn't clear when controller support will be available for mobile, so you may want to stick with PC in the meantime. Kuro Game Studio has indicated that they are working on a gamepad feature, but it looks like it won't be entirely available for all platforms on launch.\n\nThe post How to play on controller in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

Treyarch was confirmed to develop the upcoming title alongside Raven Software. Previously, the two studios collaborated on the Black Ops: Cold War campaign in 2020, which was the most recent Treyarch-led title.

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, \"I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.\"</p>\n\n<p>The interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"</p>\n\n<p>He also briefly touches on the future of <em>The Last of Us</em> TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.</p>\n\n<p>You can read the full interview <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html\">here</a>.

The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1790396884873355624\">You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here</a>. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GF8M0YoySoc\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Head to&nbsp;<em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/gameinformer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills</p>\n\n<p>The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>",
