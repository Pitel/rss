These range from the sweet to the silly to the spectacular.

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. \"Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op,\" say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier.

The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.\n \nRead more",

It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.\nRead more",

The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?\nGranted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates.

Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’?

There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.)

This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.\n \nRead more",

The Moonstone Axe's heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable.

But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass.

          "description": "Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We'll try to find out more. \nOriginal article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.\nMegacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking \"AZ-TECH\" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.\n Read more",

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole.

The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. \nRead more",

          "description": "In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.\n \nRead more",

Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.\n \nRead more",

Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of \"free\" and \"vegan\" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know.

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.",

          "description": "During the Wholesome Direct stream today, Krillbite Studio announced that their cute take on food truck employment now has a release window. Fruitbus is currently planned for release on PC sometime in October 2024.\n\n\nFruitbus grabbed my attention last year when it was announced. I really love the idea of a food truck simulation game, but the actual Food Truck Simulator was a catastrophic disappointment. Fruitbus is very similar conceptually, as you drive around in a food truck, park it in a good spot, and then cook and serve food. The big difference is that Fruitbus has a much cuter take on the profession.\n\n\n\n\nThere was a demo released shortly after its announcement. I dove into it but found it mainly functioned as a proof of concept. The basic mechanics were there, but it needed a lot more work to tie it together. A lot more work has no doubt been done at this point, so I’m looking forward to trying it out again.\n\n\nOf note was the fact that the world was somewhat bland outside of towns. One of the mechanics has you journey into the wilderness to acquire new ingredients, and the lack of liveliness in the world made this more of a chore than it has to be. There were other areas that needed to be tightened, but I don’t remember them all. This was nearly a year ago and probably an early build. Since then, the demo has been updated a few times (most recently a completely new build in March), but I decided I’d probably wait until closer to release to try again.\n\n\nIt’s still a few months off, but at least I know where I should be clearing my schedule. If you’re interested in taking Fruitbus for a spin, there’s a demo available now.\n\n\nFruitbus will be available for PC this October, 2024.\n\nThe post Cute food truck simulator Fruitbus opens for business in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Way back in 1990, Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza created a brand new character for the ever-expanding Marvel Comics universe. The mercenary named Wade Wilson, better known by the alias Deadpool made his introduction in the pages of The New Mutants #98. Little did anyone realize then how much of a global phenomenon this character would become in only a few short years.\n\n\nPlenty of quips, fourth wall breaks, and astounding comic book moments later, Deadpool has become one of the most popular Marvel creations of all time. His crude humor and willingness to poke fun at just about anything has endeared him to generations of comic readers, in addition to those who don't read so often. Merchandise, cartoons, and movies, such as the highly anticipated Deadpool & Wolverine, set to release on July 2…",

          "description": "Fortnite's Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked was off to a rough start as many players felt alienated by the bigger focus on vehicular combat. Things got even worse when some players began wondering if premium cars offered more advantages than free ones, and someone proved the doubts right.\n\n\nCredit for the discovery goes to Tiktoker Nickeh30, who easily proves in the video below that some of the cars you can only get by spending V-bucks offer much greater protection to their drivers:\n\n\n\n\nEven though this doesn't apply to every single one of the premium cars at your disposal, it's still a problem because Epic states that paid cosmetic skins that offer actual gameplay advantages go directly against the company's policy. The company quickly addressed the situation by admitting that the issue exists and stating that it's working on fixes that will begin rolling out with the upcoming updates.\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, The unfair advantages present in premium cars don't come from better stats resulting from secret codes that the company put there just to benefit the rich. They come from these cars' more extravagant design that features smaller windshields and leave the drivers way more protected. It seems like this was but one of the many untold side benefits of being rich. \n\n\nYou'd think that a car design inspired by Lamborghini wouldn't be the best choice for a road trip on the Wasteland, but these things have proven time and time again that they're somehow capable of adapting to any situation.\n\n\n\n\nFor better or for worse, you can now enjoy Fortnite's Mad Max-inspired new season on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\n\nThe post Fortnite’s accidental pay-to-win cars, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been over 10 years since Bit Kid successfully crowdfunded Chasm and nearly six since it fully launched. Now the developer is ready to return to the Metroidvania genre, this time ditching procedural generation in favor of the gnarly, intricately-designed world of WOLFHOUND.\n\n\nThere's no release date in place yet, but WOLFHOUND is in the works for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam). You can see what Bit Kid is going for with this one in the announcement trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nSet in 1944, WOLFHOUND sees the appropriately grizzled Capt. Chuck \"WOLFHOUND\" Rossetti attempting to infiltrate a Nazi base hidden in the Bermuda Triangle. Naturally, that means he'll run into a number of monstrous creatures during his mission as he scavenges for weapons and ammo and ventures deeper into the heart of a greater mystery.\n\n\nBack to basics\n\n\nScreenshot via Bit Kid\n\n\nThe visuals immediately stand out, and not just because of some great character animation. Check out that tile arrangement, which manages to look mismatched and hectic in a way that works and feels authentic. That authenticity is one of the key aspects driving the aesthetic. Bit Kid founder and lead developer James Petruzzi said he wanted to \"dive deep into the style of NES and 8-bit gaming\" with this one. While this isn't exactly something you could ever get running on an original console, WOLFHOUND adheres to an 8-bit color palette and 320x180 pixel resolution. \n\n\nSome of the artistic talent reeling in all those pixel art explosions and viscera have previously worked on games like Freedom Planet 2, Sparklite, and the Shantae series. In a similarly legitimate vein, the soundtrack was composed in Famitracker, featuring the chiptune earworms of RushJet1 (Alwa's Legacy, Cave Story+). It all swirls together for a run-and-gun concoction I very much want to play right now, so hopefully, we won't be waiting too long. \n\nThe post Chasm devs reveal sci-fi WWII Metroidvania WOLFHOUND, and it looks gnarly appeared first on Destructoid.",

The FC Mobile Training Transfer, as planned by EA Sports, will help to reduce many headaches.\n\n\nFC Mobile Training Transfer Guide\n\n\nThe FC Mobile Training Transfer process will be pretty straightforward, and a new currency will be introduced for the same purpose. You'll be able to earn Training Transfer points, which will be used to shift the XP from one card to another.\n\n\nImage via EA Sports\n\n\n\nSelect Training Transfer from the menu.\n\n\nFirst, select the card from which the training will be transferred.\n\n\nSecond, select the card which will receive the XP.\n\n\nClick on the 'Transfer' button to complete the process.\n\n\n\nThere are still going to be a lot of strategies involved with the transfer process. First, the training transfer will be limited if the target player has a lower rank. In such cases, the extra XP will remain with the original card, and you can transfer it once the rank of the target card is high enough. Additionally, ranks of the cards won't be affected by any transfer of training. \n\n\nYou should also remember that 10% XP will be lost in each transfer. Training Transfer points, required in every exchange, won't be infinite either. However, there will be plenty of in-game activities from which players can earn these points.\n\n\nFC Mobile Training Transfer will be available after the update on June 11.

Set to release on PC on July 11, players will finally be able to lace up and start kicking down the doors of anthropomorphic enemies that plague the menacing city.\n\n\n\n\nI've been excited about this one since it was announced back in 2022. It looks like the fast-paced reckless fun you'd expect from a Devolver-published title, where I'll probably die a lot and end up slamming the restart button to get right back into the madness.\n\n\nPlayers will navigate various levels using their...Anger Foot...to kick down doors to surprise and eliminate enemies as they move through each level as quickly as possible. While your primary weapon is your foot, you'll also be able to pick up additional weapons and power-ups as you progress.\n\n\nAnger Foot is set to release on PC on July 11.\n\nThe post Anger Foot kicks up a PC release date of July 11 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Console playtesting will also be launching this Fall to give players a little taste of gameplay and get it ready for its full launch. \n\n\nBased on the trailer, M-Corp has now gone as skaters infiltrate San Vansterdam. The corporation previously had a hold of the city, but their misdeeds have finally caught up to them. Fortunately for the skaters, they can now safely travel around San Vansterdam, showing off a few gnarly tricks. \n\n\n\n\nSign-ups for the console playtest are now available via the Skate page. It'll give you a chance to see what the studio has been working on, even though it's still in its testing period. Users can then provide any feedback on the game to help shape Skate's official launch. \n\n\nPrevious Skate playtests only centered around PC and mobile versions, including the EA App. Nevertheless, the game will continue to expand with its console iterations. You may also get the chance to participate in other playtests, where Electronic Arts may invite you back for another round. \n\n\nSince Skate is still in development, there isn't a set release date as of right now. However, we do know that it will be available to play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC. Additionally, cross-play and cross-progression will be available, allowing you to experience it on any platform. \n\nThe post EA’s Skate is still in development, console playtesting coming this Fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. \nSet in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: \n\n\nFrom Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. \n\"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world,\" studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. \"This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future.\" \nHere are some screenshots from the game: \n\nEriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store). \nWhat do you think about Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream's reveal?

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.\nDustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. \n\n\nIf Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17.

It's the latest look at the game following its first gameplay appearance during last week's State of Play. \nThough this squad of hunters tries to fight back with gunfire, the ground gives way beneath them, trapping them inside a cave. We then see clips of a proper battle against these beasts, with one character using a very large gun and unleashing hell while atop a mount. The trailer also gives a few glimpses of story moments, but it's still hard to parse what the plot of Wilds entails. \n\n\nCapcom promised to share more detail about the game during Gamescom.

This upcoming action roguelite puts you in the boots of a bean who seemingly embodies every awesome trait of every action/spy hero you've ever seen.\n\n\nThe game's Steam page provides the following synopsis: \"After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him.\"\nThe humourous gameplay trailer shows the game's ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects. \nKiller Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.",

After a teaser trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, we finally have our first look at gameplay. Plus, the studio announced Slitterhead launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.\nRevealed in a new trailer during the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Slitterhead's debut gameplay trailer starts in a Chinese city, with a police detective searching through a trashed ally. He finds what appears to be a mangled body in a trash can before the trailer shows more of the neon-lit Chinese metropolis, with shots of (presumably) our playable protagonist jumping from high above to the ground below while using some spectral power that allows them to possess bodies of pedestrians. We also get a look at Slitterhead's monstrous creatures and third-person survival action gameplay, which features both guns and melee combat. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Slitterhead gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Slitterhead is looking quite action-packed, especially compared to Toyama's Silent Hill efforts. However, the lineage is clear. \nSlitterhead has largely remained a mystery since its reveal. We know in 2021, Toyama said he was working on a choice-driven game, and we assume that's Slitterhead. Toyama also told IGN Japan his next project (presumably Slitterhead) would be released in 2023. Obviously, that didn't happen, but now we know it's releasing this November. Outside of that, a behind-the-scenes video diary showed a few clips of Slitterhead, including training room-esque encounters, a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nSlitterhead hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8. \nWhat do you think about this first look at Slitterhead's gameplay?

The role-playing game is the new franchise and story from the same creative team responsible for the recent Persona games, including Persona 5.\nThe main focus of their presentation was on Archetypes, the game’s approach to classes. The characters of the game transform into various Archetypes, and within the storyline, these Archetypes represent the  manifestion of will to face one’s fears.\nArchetypes include the likes of Ninja, Merchant, Warrior, Destroyer, Gunner, Assassin, or Knight. In total, there are more than 40 distinct Archetypes.\nThe subsequent trailer showed off how some of these Archetypes function in gameplay.\nIf you’re excited to see the Persona team’s talents translate over into a true fantasy backdrop, Metaphor: ReFantazio is on the way to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, and PC, on October 11.",

The teaser implied Batman would be tussling with the Rat King (not to be confused with Ratcatcher, we think) in VR, and it would be canon to the Arkham universe that Rocksteady created, but little else was revealed beyond that. Today, we received another pre-rendered trailer, so while we're still not sure how the game will look and play, we at least have a better idea of the game's tone and characters. The dramatic cover of a popular song chosen for this cinematic trailer? \"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\" by the Smashing Pumpkins A.K.A. the rat in a cage song.\n\n\nThe trailer shows Gordon, The Rat King, seemingly in a prison cell, and what appears to be a still-sane version of Harley Quinn. Here is the story outline from the trailer's press release.\nIt’s the Fourth of July, and Gotham City is besieged by a new threat: the mysterious Rat King and his cultish devotees. Public officials have been abducted, including Batman associates Commissioner Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. The Rats have pledged to execute them in one week’s time for “crimes committed against the people of Gotham City.”\nAs widespread rioting engulfs the city, Batman races to prevent this so-called “Day of Wrath,” but it all goes wrong.\nSet between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll experience the origins of such iconic characters as The Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, and more, as Batman grapples with the contradiction at the core of his identity—the use of force in pursuit of\n\nThe press release for the new trailer promises the game will have a \"blend of exploration, stealth, and free-flowing combat the series is known for.\" The game is coming exclusively to Meta Quest 3 this year.",

It looks beautiful, as do the animations of the woman, Alba, and Neva, her canine companion. In addition to platforming, Alba can gracefully cut down foes with her sword as Neva backs her in combat.

That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.\nRight now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:\nMega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge\nMega Man II\nMega Man III\nMega Man IV\nMega Man V\n\n\nFor those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware. \nYou can stay updated on the Nintendo Switch Online’s retro offerings by visiting our complete database of available games.",

Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.\" It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. \nCheck out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:\n\n\nIn Arena, players find \"Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma's Colisseum. Here, Morgan's clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.\" Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.\nIn the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. \nHere are some Kiborg screenshots: \n\nArena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. \nYooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window. \nAre you excited for Yooka-Replaylee? Let us know in the comments below!",

Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game's preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. \nThat same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will \"expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates\" for all players at no additional cost. \nHere's a look at the Concord box art: \nAlongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. \nHere's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: \n\"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,\" the blog post reads. \"That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.\" \nThat beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. \nFor more, watch the Concord reveal here. \nHow do you feel about Concord's price point?

The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.\nRed and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. \nA press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. \nWhile we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here.

If you've been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. \n\n\nTo celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an \"Extra Battle\" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. \n\"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,\" a press release reads. \"Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use.

          "description": "The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it's adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. \n“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”\nEven though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be \"quite big\" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.\nHBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” \nFor those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.\n[Source: Deadline]",
