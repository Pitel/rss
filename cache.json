If the name hadn’t made it clear already, rather than running a hospital for money, Two Point Campus has you running a university campus… for money. Capitalism and management sims go hand-in-hand, what can you do? But does this freshman venture pass with flying colours, or is it little more than a dropout?\nThe premise begins very simply: you have a university campus where you can build classrooms, lecture halls, dormitories, student lounges, everything prospective uni-goers might want (and need) to graduate. But the trick is less about rinsing your younglings for all the cash that they carry and kicking them out the door as quickly as possible; instead, your reputation as a university is king, and struggling, unhappy, or failing students will result in fewer applications the following academic year. This leads to lower revenue, fewer resources to make things better for future students, and the inevitable debt that comes from frantically taking loans from Smell My Cash.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I've crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that's now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds.

          "description": "Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as \"The Laughing Deer Show\". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.\nIn fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question \"what games would you play for the first time again?\" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory?

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.\nRead more",

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. \nYou play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love? \nRead more",

Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.\nIt's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.\nRead more",

Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online.

Vývoj je víceméně hotov a Mesa dostává vylepšení běhu OpenGL i pro modely od HD 4000 níže až k HD 2900, tedy prvním GPU AMD s unifikovanými shadery.",

From re-releases and remasters to brand-new titles, there hasn't been a shortage of good strategy options to go around, and Square Enix has been at the forefront of it. Because of that, I was left wondering where a new IP like The DioField Chronicle would fit in.\nThe answer, as it turns out, is that it doesn't. The DioField Chronicle, from Square Enix and Lancarse, isn't a classic turn-based tactics game like Tactics Ogre. It's not turn-based at all. It's a real-time strategy RPG, and those two flavors meld together to make a surprisingly interesting and novel concept that stands out all on its own.\nWe got some hands-on time with the demo for The DioField Chronicle, ahead o…",

          "description": "Because sure, why not\nIt looks like Pac-Man could be hitting the silver screen. A new report claims a film is in development, based on Pac-Man, and it's live-action.\nThe Hollywood Reporter says the project is in the works between Bandai Namco Entertainment and Wayfarer Studios. It's apparently based on an original idea from Chuck Williams of Lightbeam Entertainment, a producer on 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog.\nWayfarer was founded by Justin Baldoni and Steve Sarowitz, and was behind Disney+ feature Clouds. No further details have been reported on what direction this live-action adaptation of the arcade classic might take.\nBandai Namco, meanwhile, has seen a number of video game adaptations come and go. They've ranged from varying Tekken films to series and anime adaptations. Tekken itself is getting another iteration on Netflix later this month, with Tekken: Bloodline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6-donCAnCc\nPuck Man to the rescue\nConsidering there isn't too much narrative fodder to work with, I have to wonder where exactly a Pac-Man movie goes. Maybe a comedy that imagines the Pac-Man world and its everyday action as a standard 9-to-5 world, like Wreck-It Ralph.\nOr maybe it goes a darker, grim route, imagining Pac-Man as some grizzled ghost hunter. What if the \"games\" are put on by a higher power, and Pac-Man is in some kind of Squid Games situation, fighting to survive in a maze full of ghosts and dots?\nHonestly, I have no clue. But since video game adaptations have shown absolutely no sign of slowing down in the near future, I'm down for whatever. Resident Evil has had multiple adaptations in the last few years, Castlevania keeps tearing it up on Netflix, and League of Legends struck gold with Arcane. If Mario and Sonic, are both returning to the silver screen, then Pac-Man should get a shot too.\nThe post A live-action Pac-Man movie is reportedly in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not quite time to embark\nARC Raiders, the debut effort from Embark Studios, is taking a little extra time to come together. The developer announced today that it has delayed ARC Raiders to 2023.\nIn a statement, the team says it appreciates support so far. \"ARC Raiders is an ambitious game, and we will be using this extra time to expand the experience, and allow it to reach its fullest potential,\" reads the post on social media.\nhttps://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1556656803265609728\nThe studio says it will be going into more details about ARC Raiders as soon as it starts to more extensively test the game with players.\nInvaders from outer space\nFirst teased and then officially shown off at The Game Awards 2021, ARC Raiders is a co-op PvE shooter. Players will have to band together to fight off killer enemies from outer space.\nIt has a big retro-future vibe, in the same vein as Deathloop and the upcoming Rollerdrome. It's also got some notable industry names attached to its developer, Embark Studios.\nEmbark is headed up by former DICE CEO Patrick Söderlund, so it could have some similar ideas. And honestly, a co-op PvE game with a mix of outer-space and tinge of Battlefield sounds pretty alright to me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKASgkxK1g\nWe haven't seen too much of ARC Raiders yet though, aside from what was shown at last year's Game Awards. It's third-person, and seems to have a pretty hefty amount of gunfire and explosions, as well as some fearsome and massive robots to take down. It's some borderline Earth Defense Force vibes, which I'll be honest, I'm here for! Big robots versus small soldiers sounds like a good time.\nWe'll see how the project comes together as Embark continues to work on it and show off more. Until then, we'll have to wait for the new year to see more of ARC Raiders.\nThe post Embark’s co-op shooter ARC Raiders has been delayed to 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There's still so much to learn about how Splatoon 3 will differentiate itself from the pack\nIn what will most likely be the last major update until launch, Nintendo has announced a Splatoon 3 Direct: debuting on August 10 at 6AM PT. That's in two days!\nSomehow, Nintendo plans on spending \"roughly 30 minutes\" on the game, which is on the longer side for these sorts of micro/single game Directs. Even the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct was about 24 minutes, so they're clearly aiming high here. There are precedents though. Back in 2015 (!) Nintendo essentially had to sell people on a brand new franchise, and spent 33 minutes explaining the universe of the first game. Then a few years later for the sequel, that Direct was nearly 27 minutes long.\nEither way, there's a lot we can still glean from another Direct, like:\nStory (Return of the Mammalians)/lore info\nCampaign structure\nMore multiplayer maps/weapons\nSalmon Run (co-op) info\nSecrets/extras like amiibo support\nThe last part is what I'm rooting for, and serves as perfect Direct material. That sort of mysterious tease is what gets all the speculation going once the video is done, and Nintendo is generally pretty good at it! Plus, I hope there's some form of amiibo support (even minor): as it stands, there's no mention of amiibo on the game's various regional store pages, which could be confirmation or an oversight.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1556626244644503553\nThe post Nintendo continues its smaller Direct strategy with Splatoon 3 on August 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Day 2 went on for so long that it technically ended on Day 3. With another post-midnight finish in the works for the final day of the show, the folks at Arc System Works gave everyone a break by bringing their big announcement for Guilty Gear Strive to the Evo stage before the Top 8 tournament started. And what an announcement it was. Not only is Bridget coming to the game as part of Guilty Gear Strive's second season of DLC, but Bridget will be playable starting tomorrow, August 8.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlf83j7WD8\nArmed with a yo-yo and mechanized teddy, Bridget debuted in Guilty Gear X2 and has been a fan favorite ever since. A poll conducted by Arc System Works in 2013 named Bridget the most popular character in the franchise. So it was only a matter of time before Bridget was added to Strive.\nWith the reveal of Bridget, Arc System Works also reminded fans of its roadmap for the second season of DLC. A second fighter is scheduled to release this year as part of the season pass with the third and fourth characters hitting in 2023 alongside two new battle stages. New fighters are always great, but I love when developers make sure to include new arenas as part of DLC season passes.\nIn addition to the big Bridget news, it was also revealed that Guilty Gear Strive has sold one million copies.\nThe post Bridget walks the dog into Guilty Gear Strive tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Resharpen your blade...\nSNK's 2019 release Samurai Shodown is a sharp-ass game — in both literal and metaphorical ways. The cult fighter successfully managed to reinvent itself for modern platforms, while retaining the very deliberate, intense, and high-damage combat style of the Neo Geo classics. Packed with interesting characters and powered by an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master play style, Samurai Shodown is a unique fighter that deserves to sit within the current zeitgeist.\nAnd it looks like the cult title is getting the opportunity to take a second swing for the gold, as developer SNK has announced that it has teamed with studio Code Mystics for a new update that will implement brand new rollback netcode for the PlayStation, Xbox and PC editions of the period piece scrapper. While SamSho is a fine title from an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint, unfortunately, the online element leaves a lot to be desired. While, in 2022, you can still find people fighting the good fight, lag-free action is harder to come by — which is a no go in such a precise, high-damage fighter.\n\nAnd so, for the dedicated Samurai Shodown community — and fighting game fans in general — the rollback netcode update will be a very welcome addition, along with a sign that SNK has not abandoned the title in favor of some of its more modern releases. In fact, it is believed that the new update should bring online fluidity in alignment with The King of Fighters XV, which has very solid online stability once its fights are underway.\nNo specific release date was announced for the new update outside of the general window of spring 2023. Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia. Once again, the netcode update is only coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox editions of the game.\nEvo 2023 is currently underway. You can check out the full schedule right here.\nThe post Rollback netcode coming to Samurai Shodown spring 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players guide an intrepid miner through a series of single-screen underground caverns, digging out tunnels and battling the monsters that dwell within.

During the opening night of Evo 2022, a teaser trailer dropped revealing that Marie will become a playable character. Launching in 2023 for both Skullgirls 2nd Encore and Skullgirls Mobile, Marie's arrival on the character select screen comes more than 10 years after Skullgirls first launched on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. She follows Annie of the Stars, Umbrella, and Black Dahlia in joining the cast, the latter of whom is still in alpha.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCcAlwQb8Vo&t=3s\nThere is not a whole lot to take from that teaser, but I'm sure the news is more than enough for those Skullgirls fans who have stuck with the game over the last 10 years. As a casual fighter fan, I have to commend Future Club, Autumn Games, and Hidden Variable for keeping this game and its community going as long as it has. Other developers would have already thrown in the towel and moved on to a sequel.\nAs for the Skullgirls tournament at Evo 2022, congratulations to SonicFox for bringing home the victory in the Grand Finals against Dekillsage.\nSkullgirls 2nd Encore is now available for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. It is scheduled to launch for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S later in 2022. The Season 1 Pass is now available for PC and PlayStation 4. It is expected to release on Nintendo Switch before the end of the year.\nThe post Marie will be playable in Skullgirls 2nd Encore starting next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a new Steam client beta, Valve has added support for Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.\nThe dual-unit controllers are, of course, primarily for the Nintendo Switch. But just in case you've been wanting to use them on your PC, some additional support is currently in the Steam beta.\nValve's support allows for the Joy-Cons to be used individually, as mini-gamepads. Or they can be combined into a paired, singular controller. Essentially, the same controller configurations you might mess around with on your Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WniaKJzCNRI\nIf other Nintendo controllers are more your speed, the Steam client beta also has improved support for Nintendo Online classic controllers. That includes the Nintendo 64, NES, SNES, and Genesis controllers. Support for those classics rolled out last week, but it looks like Valve is improving on the support that's already available.\nJoyous controller options\nIt might seem a bit strange of an update, at first. I mean, I have tried to connect Joy-Cons to a PC before, with extremely mixed results. But official support isn't just nice for those who don't want to pick up extra controllers.\nJoy-Cons are a pretty unique style of controller, with built-in sensors and everything. I'd only be speculating, but I'm interested to see what modders and other controller tinkerers can do with this.\nAnd more controller support is never a bad thing. I'm almost tempted to try connecting these to a Steam Deck, if only to enable the bizarre dream of using Switch Joy-Cons on a portable PC.\nWhether you're just looking for some extra Rocket League controllers or concocting bizarre scenarios, it seems neat. If you want to try it out, you can simply opt into the Steam client beta and test out Joy-Con support for yourself.\nThe post A Steam client beta update adds Nintendo Switch Joy-Con support appeared first on Destructoid.",

A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it.

The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period.

As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. \nWhile waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack.

          "description": "SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. \nThis news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. \nIf you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. \nIt’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise. \nAre you excited about a new Fatal Fury game?

She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. \nFor example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion.

          "description": "When Nintendo first introduced the Switch Online classic games catalog featuring NES games, I bemoaned the announcement of what I saw as an inferior content delivery system. Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.\nThen in 2020, something changed.

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",

          "description": "Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. \nIf you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.\nHere are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: \nMonster Hunter World: 18.3 million \nResident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million\nMonster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million\nResident Evil 2: 9.8 million\nMonster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million \nResident Evil 5: 8.3 million\nResident Evil 6: 8.3 million\nStreet Fighter V: 6.6 million\nResident Evil Village: 6.4 million\nStreet Fighter II: 6.3 million\nAs you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. \nNow that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March. \n[Source: MyNintendoNews]\nAre you surprised by this list? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.\nFollowing in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. \nSince the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road.

That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. \nDeveloper Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.\nWe just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!\npic.twitter.com/LHdJtgKTHV\nAugust 4, 2022\nOoblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today's news seems to reaffirm that release window. \nWe've enjoyed Ooblets whenever we've checked in on it over the years, so it's exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.",

The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. \nThe game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. \n\n\nDespite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled.

You can read the complete statement below:\nSeason 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you'll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James' butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, \"I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I've come away impressed with what I've played so far.

If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.\nThe finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.\nFinally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. \nSince the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.",

          "description": "Amazon's cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.\nThe hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.\nAmazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. \nThrough the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company's new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.",

While hardware sales of the base Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite have surpassed 111 million units sold, sales are down nearly 23% overall. \nMore specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch's sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%.

While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.\nWe still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word \"authenticity\" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:\nEasier Play\nMore Pro for the Pro Stick\nHang on the Rim\nShooting is a Weapon\nKilling Stalls with Adrenaline \nDefensive Play\nImproved A.I.\nBadges Sound More Confusing But Better?\nPurchase",

          "description": "Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a \"AAA game studio\" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. \nNow, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. \nHere's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp\nJuly 30, 2022\nOne more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.\n@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx\nJuly 30, 2022\nAs you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. \nThe reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, \"I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine\" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. \nWhat do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. \nOne of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. \n“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” \nIf you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. \nYou’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).\nIn the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review. \nHave you ever used the PS5 Accolades feature?

If you don't think so, you can call into Madden NFL's ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA's snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.\nShoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉\nJuly 29, 2022\nAccording to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.\n1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯\nJuly 29, 2022\nSome NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA's involvement.\nTell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...\n@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ\nJuly 29, 2022\n89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!\n#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE\nJuly 29, 2022\nYo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!\n#RatingsAdjustor and get me right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/uHE9xnAS9X\nJuly 28, 2022\nThe hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year's ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player's rating? We'll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I'd call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.\nFor more on Madden NFL 23, check out our preview that details many of this year's changes.",
