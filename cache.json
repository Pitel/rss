Thankfully, these incidences are rare, but goodness, it can feel completely debilitating when it happens.\nTake the below short clip from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, for instance, posted on X by user @ArtistRemaining. Taking place during a race on the N64 'Yoshi Valley' track, the player takes a cheeky shortcut on the third and final lap, however the speed boost from two mushrooms lying on the bridge causes the kart to careen off the side and into the void.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We thought everyone should play it. We were blown away by how skillfully Thunderful Games had taken everything satisfying about X-COM-style turn-based action and made it work in 2D: the step-by-step growing tension during missions; the zen-calmness of analysing the environment and enemies and then executing decisions; the existential finality of committing to a choice and living by it.\nLike a pinged sniper shot ricocheting off multiple walls into the back of a steambot head, we were blown away by the gameplay USP – the need to manually aim your shots during battles. The 2D style provided this additional mechanical twist that would have been difficult to replicate in 3D. You aim carefully, like someone lining up a golf putt. You fire. You bounce shots from walls. When you succeed, you feel good and skillful. When you miss, you grow frustrated, and you watch as your steambot, wide open now to a counterattack from a should-be-dead enemy, suffers a blast of shrapnel that tears their jolly robot body into pieces.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

          "description": "The Steam Deck’s competitors, whether they’re the old guard Ayaneo family, the luxe Asus ROG Ally X, or the shapeshifting Lenovo Legion Go, usually share the same attack line: they can play more of your games. The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The \"Crush Depth\" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.\nRead more",

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it \"a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.\" \nRead more",

It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, Splitgate 2 is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called \"time domes\" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.\nRead more",

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.\nIt looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.\n Read more",

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline.

It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

It's a 2.5D, \"neo super scaler\" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate \"expert\". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.\r\n \nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.\nRead more",

There are bits that make me think of Batman: Arkham City, and bits that make me think of Pathologic, and bits that make me think of Yakuza - a combination fit to burst the brain.

This has less to do with GTA in itself, Vermeij says, than with the fact that changes in computing capacity today simply aren't as dramatic as in the days of the very first PlayStation.

          "description": "Every Level Zero: Extraction contract involves finding an item in one way or another. Initially, the Gunsmith, Taras Zbroiv, will ask you for the Photo of Laboratory in exchange for rewards. So, if you're having trouble locating this picture, we'll show you exactly where to find it.\n\n\nLevel Zero: Extraction Photo of Laboratory location\n\n\nThe Photo of Laboratory can be found in the Recreation Room of Sector B's Research Facility (Level 0). Although the description mentions a 'Lounge Room,' the map rewords it with 'Recreation Room' instead. Open your map to ping this destination, and try to zoom in to see the best pathway.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nLook for the dimly lit Recreation Room sign and open the door to get inside. Find a fridge to pick up the Photo of Laboratory in Level Zero: Extraction.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSometimes, the photo will be relatively easy to grab, primarily when you've spawned at Sector B's elevator. But if you land in Sector A, try again the next round, as it will be a long trek to reach there.\n\n\nEven if you've located the item, you still have quite a ways to go with the extraction. I suggest immediately planning your escape the minute you get your hands on the Photo of Laboratory. Since it's a quest item, the picture cannot be placed in the saved slots. Therefore, you must survive the match until you've successfully extracted it.\n\n\nThe rewards from the Evidence of the Horrific contract may vary, but it always provides Reputation points and cash. Use it to exchange exclusive items from the Trader section. If you're a completionist enthusiast, this quest can help out with the Arms Race Winner achievement. This requires reaching the maximum Reputation level with the Gunsmith, where you must complete his other objectives.\n\nThe post Where to find Photo of Laboratory in Level Zero: Extraction Evidence of the Horrific contract appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A touch pass is often the safest way to distribute the ball in Madden NFL 25, and mastering it quickly will be highly beneficial.\n\n\nThe touch pass might not be the first option you have on your mind when sending a ball to your receiver. You'll be primarily relying on the bullet pass, but using that option may not always be fruitful. Instead, you can utilize an option that's slightly slower and has a greater curve than a bullet pass, which makes it easier for the receiver to catch.\n\n\nHow to perform a touch pass in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe core process is the same, irrespective of which control methods you use.\n\n\n\nPress the icon of the receiver.\n\n\nHold for a slight bit for the power curve to load, and then let go.\n\n\nMake sure you don't end up powering up all the way, as that will result in a bullet pass.\n\n\n\nIf performed correctly, you'll make a pass that almost looks like a bullet pass but with a slightly more arch. In simpler words, its trajectory looks like a mixture of the paths of a bullet and lob pass.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nWhen to perform a touch pass in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe touch pass is really comfortable to grab for receivers. Out of three types of passes, this is the easiest one when it comes to catchability. But it also means that it's easier for the defense to get hold of the ball if they manage to intercept a pass.\n\n\nThe best time to make this pass is when your receiver is in the clear and stationary. This pass will help to add an extra layer of security to the pass being made and help avoid a potential fumble.\n\nThe post How to throw a touch pass in Madden NFL 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was originally slated for August 15, but has been pushed back to September 10.\n\n\nIt’s always a difficult decision to delay a game’s launch, but personally, I’m a bit relieved. There was no way I’d have time to play it for review this week. Next month? Possibly!\n\n\nIn a Twitter post, Strange Scaffold said, “We want to make sure it’s as breathtaking as you expect and we know it can be, while letting our team hit that goal in a healthy and sustainable way.” Healthy and sustainable? In this economy?\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the information I got from their PR is that this is to ensure the game is stable. It happens. Sometimes bug squashing and polish doesn’t go as smoothly as hoped.\n\n\nI Am Your Beast is a fast-paced “covert revenge thriller FPS” that has you sprinting through hordes of enemies, taking them out in fanciful ways. It focuses on player fantasy, making you feel powerful and hyper-powerful.\n\n\nThere was a demo during Steam Next Fest this past June, but I was recovering from a nervous breakdown and wasn’t able to fit it into my schedule. I figured I’d circle around to it anyway, since I’ve been keeping an eye on Strange Scaffold for a while. El Paso, Elsewhere was one of my favorite games of last year. This year, I wasn’t as keen on Life Eater or Clickolding, but I appreciate their vision. Playing a game that tries something interesting but misses the mark is much more meaningful than playing one that competently does nothing special. Hopefully, I Am Your Beast is both interesting and hits the mark.\n\n\nI Am Your Beast will now release on PC September 10, 2024.\n\nThe post Strange Scaffold’s I Am Your Beast gets delayed until September appeared first on Destructoid.",

While TES5 has its brutal moments, it evidently wasn't enough for one person who felt the aging RPG needed just a soupçon of additional gore.\n\n\nHacking and slashing is the name of the game with \"Dismembering Framwork,\" created by Nexus Mods user Seb263. If you're tired of striking at foes with all your might only for them to just get knocked back and maybe bleed a little, this one's for you.\n\n\n\n\nYou see, this mod adds in \"real time dismemberment,\" as well as \"realistic blood splatters.\" It's even said to have \"adaptive sound effects based on armor and weapon types\" for when you really want to hear your sword connect with your opponent.\n\n\n Become Skyrim's own freelance butcher\n\n\nThe above video is but a dangling hunk of tasty meat to really entice you in. Now, we all know the vanilla version of Skyrim already has a decapitation feature. However, it's reserved for a kind of finishing move, whereas with \"Dismembering Framework,\" it all happens in real-time.\n\n\nNote the ability to remove limbs with a swing of a sharp weapon. Any Khajiits giving you trouble? Simply lop off their tail and watch them dance around in agony, blood spewing from the wound. Dance. Dance in an aquifer of your enemy's ichor!\n\n\nGot a bit carried away there. Anyway, yes. As I was saying: Skyrim needs more violence.

          "description": "In The Time of Ninja there are six total elements you can roll from, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. At the moment, the overall balance between the elements is decent but there are certainly a couple better than the others. We've put together a The Time of Ninja Elements Tier List to highlight the best elements you should strive for.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Time of Ninja Tier List for all Elements\n\n\nThe six elements currently present in The Time of Ninja have varying degrees to strength. While each element will allow you to play the game without issue, two certainly rise above the reset and therefore lie in our S Tier, while two others are very strong but not quite as powerful as those in the S Tier, thus putting them in the A Tier. Finally, the remaining two elements are alright but compared to the other four simply aren't as strong, which is why they are in the B Tier. It's expected that more elements will be added over time, and with balancing, this tier list is sure to change. Here is our The Time of Ninja Elements Tier List:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nIce\n\n\nLightning\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nFire\n\n\nWind\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nEarth\n\n\nWater\n\n\n\nA good strategy is to roll until you at least get an element in the A Tier, like Fire or WInd, then use additional rerolls as available to go for those in the S Tier. Even though the A Tier elements are fine, you'll notice a definite difference when using either the Ice or Lightning element compared to some of the others.\n\nThe post The Time of Ninja Elements Tier List appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Destiny 2 relies heavily on grouping with your fellow guardians to complete its various challenges, both big and small. It's not a bad solo experience, either, as the various campaigns prove, but it's catered toward groups or matchmaking. However, there's still a handful of challenges to tackle on your on through content you solo.\n\n\nRegardless of your path forward, considering a few solo dungeon rewards can be worth it. If that sounds like your forte, you might be wondering where to start. Here's the easiest dungeon to solo in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhich dungeon should you solo first in Destiny 2?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe easiest dungeon to solo by far is the Grasp of Avarice dungeon, available as part of the 30th Anniversary Pack. This dungeon houses a ton of encounters that, while not incredible for it, are uniquely designed to be handled solo. The ones that come to mind are the early scorch cannon puzzle and the sparrow run, but the other encounters are still easily soloable.\n\n\nIf you don't have the 11130th Anniversary Pack or simply want something easier, the next best dungeons are the Shattered Throne and Pit of Heresy. These are early dungeons back when Bungie was still dipping their toe into the whole idea, so the mechanics and encounters are quite simple to understand. I have a personal love for Pit of Heresy since the final song for it is awesome, but either is fine for getting your first solo completion.\n\n\nThe only dungeons that are worth holding off on doing solo are the four dungeons as part of the Witch Queen and Lightfall dungeon keys. Not only do those require dungeon keys to access, but they're typically more difficult to solo. That isn't to say it's impossible, but you'd be better off waiting until you're more comfortable with solo content.\n\nThe post What is the easiest dungeon to solo in Destiny 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

With an open beta on the way, all interested players will get to try it, so here's how you can gain access to it yourself.\n\n\nHow to get in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Beta\n\n\nThe Black Ops 6 open beta is open to all players once it starts, but not initially. The game features an Early Access period that will allow people who pre-order the game or have a qualifying active Xbox Game Pass subscription to play it early. \n\n\nIf you're looking to play the beta for Black Ops 6 early, simply pre-order any Digital Edition through your platform's digital storefront. You can also subscribe to Xbox Game Pass (Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, Game Pass Console). Both methods will automatically flag your account for early open beta access, and you'll be able to log into the Early Access open beta as soon as it opens.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nAlternatively, you can pre-purchase the game at any physical retailer to receive a redemption code. This code, once entered and redeemed, will also flag you for access to the Early Access Open Beta.\n\n\nFor players interested in playing the open beta without a cost attached, you will be able to play once the Early Access period for the open beta has concluded. Once it has, you'll be able to log into the beta freely, without any extra steps. \n\n\nWhen can you play the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta?\n\n\nThe open beta officially begins on August 30 and will run until September 9. The Early Access period begins August 30 until September 4. All players, regardless of purchase status, will be able to play in the Open Beta from September 4 until its conclusion on September 9.\n\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 officially launches worldwide on October 25 for the Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. \n\nThe post How to get into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There are quite a few flavors of damage in Once Human, which can make things a bit confusing at a glance. Very confusing, actually, because the game lists Elemental Damage and Status Damage as distinct values, but they’re quite similar. It’s also difficult to explain, but here goes:\n\n\nIn a nutshell, Elemental Damage is a special kind of damage like blaze, blast, shock, or frost. Status Damage is a damage-over-time effect such as burn. Status Damage sometimes has an Elemental, er, element, but they’re essentially different concepts.\n\n\n\nElemental Damage: A specific type of damage that some enemies may be strong/weak against.\n\n\nStatus Damage: How long status effects (like burn) will last.\n\n\n\nLet me put it this way: burn is blaze damage-over-time. Your Status Damage stat increases how long this lasts.\n\n\nHowever, Status Damage doesn’t have to have an elemental attribute to it. If you have a weapon that causes vulnerability, then that will simply make the enemy take more damage for a length of time.\n\n\nWhen you’re buffing your character, you’ll want a combination of both. If you’re focusing on frost damage, you’ll want to build the Frost DMG stat. However, if you’re using a weapon that causes Frost Vortex, then you’ll also want to build up Status Damage to increase how long an enemy takes damage from its effect. You’ll benefit by giving a bit of love to both categories.\n\nThe post Once Human status damage vs elemental damage, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

This may cause you to wonder if there are cheats in Arena Breakout: Infinite to help ease the tension. And we're here to explain whether this feature is available or not.\n\n\nAre there cheats in Arena Breakout: Infinite?\n\n\nArena Breakout: Infinite does not have any cheats. In fact, it has an anti-cheat system dedicated to stopping anyone who does it in their tracks. It's pretty common for a tactical extraction game not to include this feature, as it creates an unfair gameplay experience for all players.\n\n\nImage via Morefun Studios\n\n\nDuring the closed beta test of Arena Breakout: Infinite, the developer Morefun Studios made it clear that it is committed to fair play. Their anti-cheat system is designed to detect and stop any cheating behaviors, whether it's the use of illegal software or teaming up with another cheater. The system immediately verifies these behaviors and applies penalties, including the possibility of banning the associated account.\n\n\nMorefun Studios has continued to spot these cheaters since then, bringing out upwards of 29,243 account bans in early July. Now that the game is finally out in Early Access, the reports may go up again, but only time will tell.\n\n\nEven though there aren't any cheats in Arena Breakout: Infinite, there are still a few ways you can make your experience much more accessible. Carrying around medical supplies, like bandages and painkillers, are essential in your journey. Food and drink options are also available any time the character goes hungry or dehydrated. Whatever you do, just try to prepare as much as much possible to keep you in the fight. Plus, you can take advantage of Twitch Drops to claim Loot Tickets, earning you exclusive rewards. \n\nThe post Does Arena Breakout: Infinite have cheats? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Madden NFL 25, a lob pass will often give you an unexpected advantage when attempting to score your runners a few extra yards.\n\n\nUnlike the more commonly used bullet pass, the lob pass has a lot more air behind it, but with less velocity. This makes it travel in a loopy fashion with more air time. At first, it might seem counterintuitive to throw a higher and slower pass. However, when used at the right moment, this particular pass can be a convenient way to get the ball moving.\n\n\nHow to perform a lob pass in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nPerforming a lob pass is pretty simple, irrespective of which passing mechanism you use.\n\n\n\nTap the icon of the player you're trying to pass to.\n\n\n\nThat's it - make sure to give it a simple, sweet tap and don't keep pressing, or else you'll end up performing the touch or a bullet pass. The critical aspect isn't related to the control - throwing the pass is easy. Knowing when to throw a lobbed pass makes all the difference.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nWhen should you throw a lob pass in Madden NFL 25?\n\n\nThe lob pass is supposed to be used in particular situations. Usually, your runner, who is supposed to receive the ball, should be well ahead of the man marking him. If the defender is close, it makes no sense to make a slow pass.\n\n\nThis pass is perfect when you want your receiver to receive the ball in an advanced position from where he is (while making the pass). But always be aware of the defense, and use this pass when you're trying to actively push your offense. Also, you could opt for this pass if you've receivers with excellent jumping abilities. \n\n\nIf the defense is aware of your intentions, chances are the pass will be intercepted, and the results can be quite costly. Hence, don't overdo the lob pass, and make sure to practice it before trying to attempt it during a game.\n\nThe post How to throw a lob pass in Madden NFL 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Throughout your journey, you'll encounter numerous bosses to challenge you, making it initially seem like a vast open-world game where you can explore any region you have at any time. However, while it is structured to feel open, it isn't quite considered an open-world game.\n\n\nIs Black Myth: Wukong an open world game?\n\n\nNo, Black Myth: Wukong is not an open-world game. Although you'll have much to explore throughout your playthrough, you'll follow one linear path as you fight enemies and interact with the environment. While you'll experience biomes and environments of all kinds and have plenty of room to move around, you'll have a pre-determined line of objectives to follow, with most of your freedom coming from exploring the nooks and crannies of each area.\n\n\nIn short, Black Myth: Wukong is structured so you can travel down one path, collect resources like quest materials and health recovery items, and defeat any enemies you encounter. Along the way, you'll find various story cutscenes, meet new characters, and uncover secrets throughout the map as you complete each level. You do this by entering a level or area, defeating its boss, and moving on to the next region. \n\n\nWhile this can spark conflict on whether the game is better fit to be an open-world adventure or continue as a more linear experience, trailers and previews have revealed that Black Myth: Wukong has a ton of content throughout its story, particularly with its variety in boss battles and scenery you'll find. Beyond this, its structure will largely depend on personal preference.\n\nThe post Is Black Myth: Wukong open world? Explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Red Dead Redemption has always been a bit of a sore point for PC gamers. Despite being one of Rockstar's most critically acclaimed titles, it's never left the confines of the console market. However, there have been rumors that RDR would be coming to PC years later, and it appears Sony may have accidentally let the listing slip.\n\n\nThe PlayStation Store page recently updated some details about the game, which literally stated that fans would be able to \"experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation - now on PC for the first time ever.\" It's right there in black and white, folks.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOr at least, it was. If you go onto PS Store now, you won't find the above sentence anywhere, suggesting someone has removed it. Whether Sony put this up as a blunder cannot be said, but it's not there now. Thankfully, I took a screenshot of the page earlier today. I must have anticipated something like this was going to happen.\n\n\nWill Red Dead ever come to PC?\n\n\nThere definitely seems to be something about PC as a gaming platform that Rockstar seems hesitant to work with. It took about a year and a half to get a release for GTA 5, and there's still no word on whether GTA 6 will be coming to the system or not.\n\n\nLikewise, it took over a year for a PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2 to come out. In that regard, it does seem a bit bizarre for the developer to not release the first game, despite many fans pining for it.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, it's hard to say whether RDR will be on PC. The message on the PlayStation Store was loud and clear, but its removal kind of suggests that Sony/Rockstar is not ready to make that announcement yet. We'll see what happens.\n\nThe post Possible PS Store blunder showed Red Dead Redemption is ‘now on PC’ appeared first on Destructoid.",
