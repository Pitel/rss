At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens.

          "description": "Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.\n Read more",

Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral \"SpookTube\" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. \nEach video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of \"cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation\" and \"cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views\".

ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.\nIt's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.\nViking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.\nAlongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens.

Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.\nIt's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.\nRead more",

As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.\nI think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A month ago Arrowhead's CEO revealed the existence of Joel (technically J.O.E.L., in game), a game master running the galactic battle of Helldivers 2. A human being who gets up in the middle of the night to throw more robots at players if they're doing too well. We at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast think this is a good thing, in broad terms, and we discuss why (but also hope Joel is allowed holidays), as well as the response the community of players has had, which is also very interesting. Plus a straw poll indicates that only one of us would enjoy be at the middle of a maelstrom of chaos and being the Helldivers GM as a job. Bet you can absolutely guess which one of us it was.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Pepper Grinder is one of those games that has so many great moments in it that recounting them would almost feel unfair to anyone hoping to play it. There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.\nRead more",

We've had a couple of successful outings over the years with the likes of Death's Door and Hollow Knight and company, but anything with pure FromSoft blood running through its veins has always left me cold. Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.\nRead more",

Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun.

This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.\nImportantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's.

Can you ever really know the people you love? Does it matter?

Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. \r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.\r\n \nRead more",

What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct? If you're Palworld, the answer is gleefully borrowing and travestying monster concepts from a celebrated Nintendo series. If you're Enshrouded, it's all about having a really neat building system. And if you're Dune: Awakening, the next game from Conan Exiles developer Funcom, the trick may lie with sandworms. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.\nThis look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.\nRead more",

Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions.

The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.\nNot least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now. \n \nRead more",

          "description": "The early stages of a new weapon can be a bit rough due to the limitations of Gunsmith items. Although you'll claim these tools later on, it can sometimes take a while with the more advanced levels. So, to quicken the pace, here's how to use the Unlock All Attachments glitch in MW3 and Warzone. \n\n\nUnlock All Attachments Without Leveling Up Glitch in MW3 and Warzone, explained\n\n\nTo unlock all attachments without leveling up in Warzone and MW3, customize a gun in a Private match. The weapon must be unlocked first in Multiplayer or Warzone, as the Base version is required. For example, if you haven't completed three Daily Challenges for the TAQ Evolvere, you won't be able to utilize the glitch for this gun's attachments. \n\n\nOnce you have a weapon in mind, go to the Private Match section in either the Warzone or MW3 Playlist. Now, select the Weapons section and customize the gun with any attachments. Private Matches provide access to the entire catalog, regardless of whether it is locked in the Public Playlists. Press 'Save a Custom Mod,' which is shown in the bottom-left corner. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nExit the Private Match and select a public game in Warzone or MW3. Go to the Weapons section, and the saved custom mod should now be available in the Gunsmith section. This allows you to access all attachments without leveling up, even if the Base version doesn't include these tools. I tried it out with my previous locked items and had no problems when diving into a match. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe glitch for unlocking all attachments has appeared throughout Call of Duty's timeline. However, it does seem to get patched after some time. With MW3 and Warzone Season 3's launch, the glitch has come up again now that the game has been updated. The trick could eventually be patched, so just bear that in mind for the future.   \n\nThe post How to use the Unlock All Attachments Glitch in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s buried in the user documents behind some vaguely named folders. Let’s just move on to the next paragraph, where I can be more specific.\n\n\nPalworld save games location for Steam\n\n\nOn PC, if you want to reach your save data, just paste this path into Windows Explorer's address bar: %localappdata%\\Pal\\Saved\\SaveGames and it should take you straight to it. \n\n\nIf it doesn’t take you there because, for example, you haven’t rebuilt your user profiles after several OS upgrades, then you should be able to follow this path there: C:\\Users\\insertusernamehere\\AppData\\Local\\Pal\\Saved\\SaveGames. “C:” can be whatever drive letter is holding your OS.\n\n\nNote that you cannot just browse to the saved games through the game’s Steam properties. The saved game is not contained within the Steam folder; it’s in your user files.\n\n\nAlso note that the AppData folder is sometimes hidden by windows. While the %localappdata% string should still take you there, you may need to go to the view tab on the ribbon and check the box next to “hidden files.”\n\n\nEach saved game is a folder that is named a long string of numbers. If you’re backing up your saves (for example, if you're installing mods), that’s what you’re going to want to copy elsewhere.\n\n\nPalworld save games location for Gamepass\n\n\nThe method to finding the Gamepass version’s save files is different is different. For that one you’ll want to use %localappdata%\\Packages\\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\\SystemAppData\\wgs\n\n\nOtherwise, navigate to C:\\Users\\insertusernamehere\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\\SystemAppData\\wgs\n\n\nAgain, you may need to enable “hidden files” in the ribbon to actually get this far. However, in the wgs folder you should find your saves. You can then copy them elsewhere.\n\nThe post Where to find your Palworld save data location appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Wimpod makes its first-ever Shiny debut in Pokémon Go, giving this Bug and Water Type a sparkling new take. However, this version is incredibly rare to find, as we've seen with most creatures in this category. We're here to help you narrow down the search by showing you how to get Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go.\n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go\n\n\nShiny Wimpods spawn more frequently in the wilds during the Sizeable Surprises event. The event lasts until April 9, 2024, at 8 p.m. local time, so you must watch out for it before then. Keep farming as many Wimpods as possible, and you may be lucky enough to stumble upon the Shiny version. \n\n\nThe event-themed Field Research tasks may also provide a Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go. Complete these limited-time objectives to encounter this version. Specifically, the 'Catch three Wimpod' task can unlock the Shiny Wimpod's spawn. Use PokéStops to trigger these Field Research quests, as they won't appear automatically. Although you may be inclined to test the waters in Raids, Shiny Wimpods do not appear in these challenges. \n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\nIf you miss your chance during Sizeable Surprises, don't worry; there's another opportunity shortly after. Shiny Wimpods can appear during the Bug Out event, which starts on April 12 at 10 a.m. and ends on April 17 at 8 p.m. local time. Complete any event-themed Field Research tasks during this celebration to spawn this type. \n\n\nTo evolve the Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go, use 400 Wimpod Candy. This ingredient requires plenty of Wimpod captures, but luckily, these events consistently spawn this creature. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Wimpod in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's one of several new item additions to multiplayer horror game and can be a pretty fun tool for filming your videos for Spooktube. Here is how to use the Projector in Content Warning and why it exists in the first place.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhere is the Projector?\n\n\nThe Projector kind of blends in and can be tricky to find if you don't know where to look. When you first step out of the house, look for the Sunflowers in the back straight ahead. Head forward until you reach the Sunflowers and then look to your left and you will see both the Projector and the Projector screen.\n\n\nFor now, it seems as though the Projector and screen are static, meaning you can't change where they are and will always have to return to this location when you want to use the Projector.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat can you do with the Projector?\n\n\nAs you approach the actual Projector, hit E to turn it on. It will now display a slide or image on the Projector's green screen in front of you. There are two knobs on the top of the Projector that you can also interact with to cycle through all the different backgrounds to display on the screen. Interacting with the right knob will show you the next scene while interacting with the left knob goes to the previous screen. You can cycle through all the scenes to find some pretty cool ones like city landscapes, backdrops, images of space, a breaking news screen, and much more.\n\n\nThe Projector exists for you and your friends to record some cool footage on your Video Camera before descending to the Old World or after returning. You can use the screen in the background to create backdrops for your footage which will spruce it up and get you more views when you upload it to Spooktube!\n\nThe post How to use the Projector in Content Warning appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Success in AFK Journey really comes down to your party. Not merely the characters you have fill it, but their roles as well. As a gacha game, your available heroes in AFK Journey is going to come down largely to luck. You’ll hopefully be able to, at the very least, fill certain roles, so we’ll stop there.\n\n\nNow, before we get started, I’m going to help you leg up that basically everyone recommends. Get yourself Thoran. When I was starting out, that’s the hero that kept on popping up on the list. And to be honest, when I slotted him into my party and put him on the frontline, I improved considerably.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWith that in mind, and even if you don’t have Thoran, the ideal party follows RPG rules: \n\n\n\nDPS, Tank, and Healer \n\n\n\nThe other two are wild cards. This isn’t a hard rule in terms of party comp, but it’s the most effective one.\n\n\nHealers can be the hardest to spot to fill, since not every Support hero has strong healing spells. You’ll need to actually look at what spells they have to ensure they have ones for effective healing. Hewynn, for example, can heal the whole group in one spell.\n\n\nFor DPS, your Warriors are the most all-around, but my personal preference is mages. Cecia has been my favorite for a while now, as one of her spells spawns an additional unit to both take and deal further damage. Often, I see Odie recommended as an archer role, which, again, I slotted into my party, and things immediately improved.\n\n\nAs for your tank: Thoran. If you don’t have Thoran, any hero with the Tank role can generally fill this spot. The more you rely on DPS, the more important a tank is.\n\n\nFor your wildcards, Scarlita is an excellent choice for shields. Another mage is often my preference because I love mages. With that in mind, maybe just pick the heroes you connect with most. However, if you want further recommendations of who belongs in your party, check out our AFK Journey tier list.\n\nThe post AFK Journey: Best team comps appeared first on Destructoid.",

First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.</p>\n\n<p>Nine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3yx7LvPR1mU\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo).

In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced?
