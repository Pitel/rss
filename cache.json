Maybe one of your toes.\nAnd now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL.

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io.

          "description": "An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified.

Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes?

For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

          "description": "It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient \"Chinese-style\" RPG The Bustling World. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally. \r\n \nRead more",

And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.\nThe newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as \"Ghost Of A Tail\" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

          "description": "At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

With the side story setting sail for launch next month, now is the perfect time for a new Like a Dragon Direct presentation.\n\n\nThat certainly sounds like it'll be the main focus of the next video from SEGA and the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. The Like a Dragon Direct is set to start streaming via YouTube and Twitch on January 9 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the description, the video will \"reveal various updates and first-looks at new features\" for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Considering how much there typically is to do in one of these games — even the spinoffs — the results could end up being fairly exhaustive. A Famitsu interview with Ryu Ga Gotoku boss Masayoshi Yokoyama recently revealed that Pirate Yakuza will be even longer than Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name. \n\n\nWhile this spinoff is enough to fill out a full presentation and then some, we'll have to watch and see if the team has any surprises in store. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is already staying plenty busy beyond the main Like a Dragon series, and The Game Awards 2024 saw both a new Virtua Fighter and the currently enigmatic Project Century announced. The latter is a period piece set in 1915, and the former is, well, Virtua Fighter.\n\n\nIn the meantime, we can focus on Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which heads for ridiculously choppy waters on February 21.  \n\nThe post New Like a Dragon Direct presentation coming this Thursday appeared first on Destructoid.",

During Fortnite OG's greatest hits playlist, you'll relive some old memories (or make new ones) by visiting these locations, with Flush Factory having some mysterious missing portraits to collect. \n\n\nFlush Factory missing portrait locations in Fortnite OG\n\n\nYou'll find both missing portraits in Flush Factory, a point of interest along the southern part of the island. You'll spot this landmark west of Fatal Fields and southeast of Greasy Grove. Since it's so far from everything else, your best bet is to drop from the Battle Bus directly to this spot before searching the factory building for the portraits.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUpon landing in Flush Factory, you may notice small white exclamation mark icons indicating the location of each portrait. They'll only appear if you get close, though, so you may have to run around a bit until you spot them.\n\n\nThe first missing portrait is stuck on top of a toilet lid in the bottom left part of the factory. You can access this spot by passing through the main factory area with the toilet conveyors until you find several half-assembled toilets on the ground and the portrait next to them.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe second missing portrait is in the bottom right part of Flush Factory, next to a massive green generator. If you're at the first location, head east through the factory and past the metal fences until you enter a small area with various wooden crates and the generator. You'll find the portrait inside a turtle object.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you find both portraits, you'll automatically complete this part of Fortnite OG's Chapter One Greatest Hits quest list, rewarding you with XP.

During Sony's CES 2025 press conference, Crunchyroll announced that an anime series is in the works, with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends set to premiere in 2027.\n\n\nAs the title implies, the Ghost of Tsushima anime takes inspiration from both Sucker Punch's original 2020 game and the Legends multiplayer mode that was released later that same year. There's no footage at the time of this writing, but the announcement came with the moody key visual above. \n\n\nThe legends behind Legends\n\n\nImage via Playstation\n\n\nWhile details overall are fairly light, we at least know the names of a couple of main staff members, consisting of some notable creators. Takanobu Mizuno is at the helm, and while this will be the director's first full series, Mizuno has already done some impressive work at anime studio Kamikaze Douga. In addition to handling CGI direction for the Batman Ninja movie, Mizuno directed one of the standout shorts in Star Wars: Visions, \"The Duel.\" Kamikaze Douga will animate Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, as well.\n\n\nStory composition comes from an even bigger name: Gen Urobuchi. The novelist and screenwriter has left a big mark on the industry in recent years, including writing Puella Magi Madoka Magica and creating and writing Fate/Zero. Urobuchi is also known for PSYCHO-PASS and working on the epic Japanese-Taiwanese puppet wuxia collaboration Thunderbolt Fantasy.\n\n\nWe've still got quite the wait ahead of us, but hopefully, we'll learn more about what to expect from Ghost of Tsushima: Legends soon. It'll give us plenty of time to play through the upcoming sequel, Ghost of Yotei, after it launches sometime this year.\n\nThe post Ghost of Tsushima: Legends anime revealed for 2027 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Long before the likes of Oblivion, I recall the OG PlayStation console. Its 3D capabilities and catalog of releases turned Sony into a powerhouse in the video games industry. Nostalgic though that time was, we have truly moved on since those low-poly, low-pixel days. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't return to them every so often.\n\n\nThat's exactly what Nexus Mods user gong has done. Making sure we never forget the PS1 era of gaming, they've managed to \"demake\" The Elder Scrolls 4, turning it into a blocky facsimile of its formerly smooth (though now dated) self.\n\n\nImage via gong/Nexus Mods.\n\n\n\"Oblivion Umastered,\" as it's called, has taken the classic Bethesda RPG and \"decimally crunched\" the textures, turning it into something that would sit more at home in 1995. The modder has also – if you'll pardon the language – \"rampantly polyfucked\" the meshes, and has also \"bit crushed\" the audio. I speak for myself, but I kind of like the way gong describes things...\n\n\nObliviating the visuals\n\n\nVisually and audibly, it may have been altered to an eye-bleeding quality that many of us still recall fondly, but it's the same ol' Oblivion. The modder describes it as being like a PS1-era game, but it's functionally still TES4, so nothing else has been tinkered with outside the graphics and sound.\n\n\nThey also recommend running their unmastered mod with the included shader preset, saying that it's \"actually a pretty cool experience.\" All I can say is it really makes me miss my youth.\n\n\nOf course, we can't talk about The Elder Scrolls without mentioning the elusive sixth entry. Skyrim came out over 13 years ago and while Bethesda is working on the next game, many of us are starting to grow impatient. On top of that, there are still rumors that Oblivion will be getting a remake at some point. Counter that with this PS1 demake mod and we could potentially have it all from the nearly 18-year-old RPG.\n\nThe post Turn Oblivion into a PS1-style game with this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

As revealed during Sony's CES press conference this week, the next season is officially set to kick off this April. \n\n\nLike the first, the second season will be airing on HBO and streaming on Max. Co-creator, writer, and executive producer Neil Druckmann reiterated that this season will run for seven episodes, which we previously learned about back in June 2024. Along with this news, we got a nice minute-long teaser offering up a look at the next set of episodes.\n\n\n\n\nThe season 2 logline paves the way for an adaptation of The Last of Us Part II. Set five years after the first season's events, Joel and Ellie have to deal with interpersonal conflict and \"a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.\" \n\n\nIt's been two years since The Last of Us started its nine-episode run on HBO. In the time since its conclusion, we've been reacquainted with the returning cast and introduced to a few of the newcomers. In addition to Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, we'll see more of Gabriel Luna's Tommy and Rutina Wesley's Maria in season 2. As for the newcomers, here's an overview of some of the previously announced cast additions:\n\n\nNew to The Last of Us Season 2 Cast\n\n\n\nKaitlyn Dever as Abby\n\n\nIsabela Merced as Dina\n\n\nYoung Mazino as Jesse\n\n\nAriela Barer as Mel\n\n\nTati Gabrielle as Nora\n\n\nSpencer Lord as Owen\n\n\nDanny Ramirez as Manny\n\n\nJeffrey Wright as Isaac\n\n\nCatherine O'Hara (guest star)\n\n\n\nThe first season of The Last of Us was intense, but anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II is no doubt eager to see how they handle some of the darker turns. Thankfully, we'll get to see how it all plays out in just a short few months.\n\nThe post The Last of Us season 2 set for April premiere appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
