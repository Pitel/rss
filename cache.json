While Atari itself has a few noteworthy launches here such as qomp2, Yars Rising, and RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic, it's the addition of games from Digital Eclipse and Nightdive Studios that make 2024 such a stellar year for Atari.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Point being, I can present to you my almost-made-it picks without malice nor bitterness, unlike my loser colleagues who didn’t get as many in the main list. Nyeh nyeh.\nRead more",

I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

          "description": "First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it's being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.\n\n \nRead more",

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and \"Liber-tea\", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.\nFrom today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing \"freedom\" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.\nWe here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other.

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers' previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.\nI'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It's about steering a tank through a desolate sci-fi landscape, blasting similar tank and mecha enemies to bits, then scavenging them for parts using a drone.\r\n\nIt's been in quiet development for years, but it got a big reveal during tonight's Day Of The Devs stream. It was also released during tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, so you can buy it from the Epic Games Store now.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back when I played Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest, I fought a cave-dwelling boss who summoned hordes of grotty subterranean wildlife to swamp me. Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.\nRead more",

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. \n Read more",

          "description": "Dragon Tokens have confused many Blox Fruits players since they randomly got added to the account of certain players, but it has their use inside the game.\n\n\nIncidentally, the mysterious item wasn't available in the account of every player. Instead, it got added to the accounts of those who have been Blox Fruits for some time now and had downloaded Update 24 before the developers pulled back. As I said, this item has certain uses inside the game, so let's understand how it works.\n\n\nHow to get Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits\n\n\nUpdate 24 introduced several new things to Blox Fruits, which included an updated version of the Dragon Fruit. Unfortunately, the update was pulled back by the developers, and players who had the Dragon Fruit lost access to it. To compensate the players, they were handed something called a Dragon Token.\n\n\nAgain, this token is of two types. Players having a non-permanent or physical version of the Dragon Fruit were provided with a regular Dragon Token. Those who had a permanent Dragon Fruit were provided with a Permanent Dragon Token.\n\n\nIncidentally, the price of Dragon Fruit has been raised from 4,000 Robux to 5,000 following the implementation of Update 24.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits\n\n\nThe use of a Dragon Token mostly depends on the type you have. If you have a permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to obtain a permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. The version will be completely randomized, but it's a great return since you're getting an upgraded version of the Dragon Fruit.\n\n\nIf you received a non-permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to get a non-permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. Again, the final item you get will be completely randomized. If you end up getting a duplicate Dragon Fruit in your inventory, it will be automatically changed to a Mythical Fruit.\n\nThe post How do Dragon Tokens work in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Sparkling Resolution outfit features a dress, necklace, and sleeves but is only available until January 2, 2025.\n\n\nHow to get the Sparkling Resolution outfit in Dress to Impress\n\n\nThe Sparkling Resolution outfit is a limited-time set available in the Dress to Impress clothing shop for $6,000 in-game cash or the equivalent of 1,500 Robux. You can buy the set's individual pieces or all three items at once starting from December 30 until the event's end date, January 2, 2025.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can view the Sparkling Resolution outfit by selecting the shoe and lipstick button on the left side of your screen and navigating to the dress button.\n\n\nYou have the option to buy each of the three items separately or all at once if you have enough cash. Below is the cost of every Sparkling Resolution piece:\n\n\n\nSparkling Dress: $4,500\n\n\nSparkling Sleeve: $1,000\n\n\nSparkling Necklace: $500\n\n\n\nPurchasing all three pieces costs $6,000 in-game money, making it not only possible to acquire without spending real money but making it cheaper than sets like Myra the Magical Girl. However, it's only available until January 2, giving you just a few days to get your hands on this exclusive outfit. \n\n\nIt doesn't come with a hairstyle or makeup, though, so you may have to use a few Dress to Impress codes to complete the set.\n\n\nLike other outfits in Dress to Impress, you can customize the Sparkling Resolution set to match your current theme. Depending on the theme, you may have to change it to other common colors like white, black, red, or a mix of several hues.

          "description": "Fortnite's Wintervestigation quest series is finally wrapping up, with Noir telling you about one last case leading you to confront Sgt. Winter himself. Before meeting Sgt. Winter, you'll need to search for some secret files that are part of his Naughty or Nice list.\n\n\nSgt. Winter Naughty or Nice list secret file location in Fortnite\n\n\nYou can find the secret files for Sgt. Winter's Naughty or Nice list in a tunnel along Foxy Floodgate's massive dam. As you reach this landmark, head up the zipline that connects the bottom of the dam to the road and stop around halfway. You'll spot several openings to the tunnel, with one entrance having a gingerbread cookie in front of it. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you arrive at this spot, use your pickaxe to break open the tunnel before entering. You'll spot three exclamation mark icons on top of various filing cabinets, one of which has Sgt. Winter's Naughty or Nice list.\n\n\nThere's a chance you'll run into the same bug I did where the filing cabinets appear invisible. Don't worry if this happens, as you can still interact with them as long as you hover over their general location.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou'll also need to watch out for other players as you visit Foxy Floodgate, climb the dam, and examine the secret files. Make sure to have a weapon on hand in case someone arrives before or after you so you can swiftly eliminate them and move on with your quest.\n\n\nOnce you interact with the filing cabinets and the Naughty or Nice list, you'll be ready to confront Sgt. Winter once and for all. You'll spot him just south of Foxy Floodgate at an unnamed location, giving you a bit of a trek before completing this final Wintervestigation quest. Like before, other players can attack you anytime, so watch your surroundings as you travel to these spots.\n\nThe post How to find Sgt Winter’s Secret Files in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After much confusion over the last few days, there's finally some clarity over Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite. This peculiar resource has been present inside the game since its launch, but there was no way to obtain it, getting players stuck in a particular quest, but that is no longer the case.\n\n\nHere is how you can get Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite, and what's the best way to use it.\n\n\nBest Frost Petals location in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nFor most resources in Jujutsu Infinite, opening chests is the best way forward. That's not the case for Frost Petals, which spawns all over Yuki Fortress. While the spawn spots aren't restricted to one single location, they can be generally found behind the fort.\n\n\nMove towards the edge of the map in this region, and you'll find plenty of Frost Petals. The middle of the map also has these flowers spawning on the ground. Once picked, the flower will take 10 minutes to respawn on your server. If you're willing to be patient and dedicate an hour or so, you can pick plenty of Frost Petals.\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the only plant that spawns in the Yuki Fortress area. Other plants like Cursebloom and Spring Puffs can't be found here. Frost Petals also seem exclusive to the Yuki Fortress area, and you'll have to level up decently to access this location.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nFrost Petals work differently from other resources like Maximum Scrolls or Purified Curse Hands. You can use five of them to complete daily quests in the Yuki Fortress Area.  If you're a beginner, your first priority is leveling up to Level 300 or higher. Doing so will allow you access to this area and help you to enhance your character further. Check out our farming guide to get all the resources efficiently.\n\nThe post How to get Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Doing so is extremely fruitful, as the first part of the relaunch might feel boring for many. Thanks to the enhancements, you can power up your characters faster. Here's how limit breaking works in the relaunched version of Anime Adventures.\n\n\nLimit breaking in Anime Adventures, explained\n\n\nTo Limit Break, you'll need to have 12 Mythic or higher units and also get a Divine Wish.

It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten \"remaster\".\nU zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album \"Discovery\". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\").
