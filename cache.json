          "description": "Give me something to break.\nVisco Corporation, responsible for shoot 'em up Andros Dunos (1992), was a Neo Geo stalwart, releasing 15 titles across SNK’s arcade and console hardware. One of its only forays into the fighting game arena was Breakers and its semi-sequel, Breakers Revenge. In 1996, the fighting game market was flooded. And, while it postdates Super Street Fighter II Turbo by two years, we always adored Breakers and felt it deserved wider recognition. Sadly, it never caught fire in arcades, struggling to be noticed, and never received an official home port outside of the Neo Geo CD.\nThe absolute best way to bring a 26-year-old fighting game back is by opening it up to the global stage, and on this front Breakers Collection gets it impeccably right. Featuring both Crossplay and an online versus mode buoyed by all-important rollback netcode, the game’s arrival on Switch has been a long time coming.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "If you caught our 101 most anticipated games list at the end of last week, you'll know that 2023 is the year that every dev and their dog is going to space. The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 3rd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. \n\"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry,\" he tells me. \"We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention.\" \nRead more",

I worry for my poor 1080p-tier GPU, though at least there's also freshly-announced DLSS 3 support.\n \nRead more",

While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.\r\n\n\r\nPossibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.\r\n\n\r\nYou guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those. \r\n \nRead more",

This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios.

This makes it a good performer even in sustained write scenarios, as you might encounter in video editing and the like, while its good random read/write speeds are good for gaming. Sabrent has discounted the drive to £77.99 on Amazon UK, which is a good price for this level of performance. \nRead more",

The Kyo Kusanagi fanboy will be followed in the spring by veteran Fatal Fury star and bringer of JUSTICE Kim Kaphwan. Around this time, SNK also hopes to launch a beta for its crossplay servers, which are expected to officially open at some point later this summer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv9bxAVRCQ&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nAnd speaking of the season, those warm winter months will see the return of KoF XIV debutantes Najd and Sylvie Paula Paula. Najd, as you might remember, was the winning entry in a \"Design a Character\" competition held by SNK back in 2018. As such, to see the mysterious vigilante make their return pays tribute to their designer, artist Mashael Al-Barrak. The absolute MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula is an incredibly loud, boisterous, and colorful NESTS operative, whose obnoxiously cutesy ways and dopey visage belies a dangerous killer instinct and literally electrifying fighting skills.\nHonestly? Stoked to see her again.\nTwo further characters will launch in Fall and Winter 2023, respectively, to round out Season 2.\nThe King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.\nThe post Najd and the MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula headed to King of Fighters XV appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Good things come to those who wait\nFans of the modern classic farming simulator that is Stardew Valley, and likely its massive 1.5 update which added mountains of new content to the game, will be thrilled to hear that the expansion is finally available on mobile platforms. The update first released on PC back in 2020, and mobile players have been asking when they'll get a chance to check it out ever since. Eric Barone, the solo developer behind the title, tweeted out on January 6th that the 1.5 update had been submitted for review on iOS and Android platforms. The update had some issues in its first few days as players reported various bugs, but Barone has already rolled out at least one patch to fix the most glaring problems.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1611612814271184899\nIt's easy to miss, but in the thread of replies following that initial tweet, Barone said that the re-write of the game's app that was required to make the 1.5 update work should make things \"easier to update mobile in the future (for 1.6 and who knows...).\" We have no idea what the 1.6 update would entail — it could simply be more basic bug fixes, although the fans (myself included) would be happy to guess that it's another content update, or maybe even multiplayer.\nEither way, it's great to see Barone still has plenty of love to give to his debut title, even as he's working on another upcoming release, Haunted Chocolatier.\nThe post Stardew Valley’s 1.5 update finally lands on mobile, and 1.6 is in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, this is in large part due to the fact that HBO's adaptation of the series is coming up in less than a week now, and conversations about the televised take on the first game have been swirling for months. As a long time mega fan of the series, I'll have a lot of feelings to parse through once it's finally out, but until then, I can focus on the fun that's popping up around the series right now, like this mod that makes Ellie in The Last of Us Part II look exactly like Bella Ramsey, who is portraying the beloved character in HBO's live action versi…",

It wasn’t horrible, I guess it just wasn’t what we were hoping for. Matrix Revolutions kind of just nailed the coffin shut.

She takes on a serpentine appearance and, crucially, the locks of her hair become snakes.\nThese snake hairs aren't just for show; they actually hiss and make noise in-match. Which is a cool feature, that also lacks some subtlety when you might want it.

          "description": "More Isaac for your buck\nIf you're keen on revisiting the Dead Space series ahead of the remake releasing this month, the Steam pre-order has a neat incentive. Pre-ordering the Dead Space remake on Steam before January 27 will net you the second game in the series, Dead Space 2, for free.\nAs spotted by VG247, the Steam pre-order has a special deal going. Picking up Dead Space through either its base version or slightly-more-expensive Digital Deluxe version will net you a free copy of Dead Space 2. And if you've already pre-purchased the remake, you should receive a copy of Dead Space 2.\nWhile it might feel a bit disorienting to get the sequel to the original as a tie-in for the original's remake, this does net you two absolutely stellar sci-fi survival horror gems. The Dead Space series has garnered acclaim over the years, and for good reason. The first two are prime examples of action-oriented sci-fi horror. The third game? Well, that's a different story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTDJNZ9cK1w\nSpace-based savings\nIt's a nice upside for those who want to dip back into the series ahead of the remake, or maybe have the second lined up to play after they finish the remake. That date isn't too far off, either. EA Motive's Dead Space is set to launch on January 27, 2023 for PC, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\nWhile a remake of one of sci-fi's survival classics is already a strong pitch, survival horror fans are also probably hungry for Dead Space's return. The Callisto Protocol stumbled out of the gate at the end of 2022. And now, a remake of a major inspiration is just around the corner. It could be a big one for survival horror fans. We'll see how Isaac and the crew fare on new tech in just a few weeks.\nThe post Dead Space remake pre-orders on Steam come with Dead Space 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Anyone down for a 2D puzzle platformer?\nYouTube personality videogamedunkey has made a name for himself on the internet with his game reviews/critiques and signature comedic style. Last year, Dunkey announced that he was going to be founding his very own games publishing studio known as Bigmode, and the news was met with mixed emotions.\nIt's been a little over four months since Dunkey's initial announcement, and now he has officially unveiled his first publishing partnership -- Bigmode will publish a game called Animal Well, a Metroidvania-inspired 2D puzzle platformer. Dunkey disclosed his deal with the game's developer, Billy Basso, in his newest YouTube video \"Dunkey's Best of 2022.\" He says that the game is \"one of the few at E3 [2022] that caught [his] eye,\" and that \"it's a game coming from a very pure place of love for video games.\" That sentiment was one of the main reasons Dunkey cited for wanting to start a company like this in the first place, so I'm glad he's found a title to support that aligns with his values in that way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21T-Sc-TXJY\nIf you missed the conversation surrounding Dunkey's initial announcement of Bigmode, here's the gist: some fans were annoyed that in his announcement video, Dunkey implied that he was partially responsible for the success of games like Cuphead, Undertale, and Celeste because he promoted them on his channel. Regardless, Dunkey clearly has a strong vision of the kind of games he wants publish, and while he lacks experience on the development side of the games industry, I'm looking forward to seeing if he can carve his own path in a different part of the industry.\n[Featured Image via Shared Memory]\nThe post Bigmode, videogamedunkey’s indie publishing company, announces their debut title appeared first on Destructoid.",

Do a good job, and players can earn money to improve their equipment and business, becoming the best cleaning company on the block.\nhttps://youtu.be/nIdOILxKsBA\nWe are yet to know exactly what form the new ports will take, but one can at least assume that the base game from its launch will be included, and perhaps a deluxe edition featuring any of the title's post-release DLC. It will certainly be neat to take PowerWash Simulator mobile — say via the Nintendo Switch port.So if you're looking for a title to while away the small hours before bed, or just something to chill out to, be sure to give it a squirt.\nPowerWash Simulator launches January 30 on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.

Xbox and Oreos are teaming up for a special-edition cookie design, with both a change in the cookie and some in-game cosmetics for several Xbox games.\nThe promotion is taking place in 22 countries, which Xbox specifies as Europe only. Sorry to any North American fans or other regions looking to get the special cookies.\nThese specific cookies will feature the Xbox logo and the A, B, X, Y button layout, as well as a directional arrow. By scanning the cookies and cracking the combination, players can unlock prizes for games. Entering the symbols in the correct sequence will unlock special, exclusive Oreo-themed content for games like Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, and Sea of Thieves.\n[caption id=\"attachment_357256\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Xbox[/caption]\nThe codes are meant to be inspired by cheat codes hidden in games throughout history. That does make me curious if a Konami code input is hiding somewhere in all those Oreo cookies.\nThe special cookies are expected to be available in participating regions this month, and available while stocks last. If you want to participate, you can visit the Oreo site and check here to see if your country is taking part. (Reminder, this is a Europe-only event.)\nFunnily enough, Oreos have tied into video games before now in some fun ways. The Pokemon limited edition Oreos bore the likenesses of some of the series' most well-remembered Pokemon. But this one, letting you discern special cheat codes from the cookies themselves?

The rumor, though not confirmed, seems snug, as Leatherface will soon be making his hammer blows felt in his very own assymetrical title, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which is currently in development at Sumo Digital.\nhttps://twitter.com/LeaksDbd/status/1611429823116677124?s=20&t=PG83dYm-Y8TmQYqsRvoTGg\nScheduled to launch later in 2023, and published by Gun Interactive, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will see players on the run from the terrifying Sawyer family, consisting of The Hitchhiker, The Cook, and, of course, Leatherface himself. As such, one would assume that this title would have the exclusive rights to the saggy-pants psychopath, and would rather he wasn't making an appearance in other games, especially one so immediately similar to its own.\nBehavior Interactive is yet to comment on the rumor, but we'll be sure to update this story once we know the official score. For now, it seems, Dead by Daylight Leatherface mains should probably get their \"fill\" of Survivors, before their favorite run 'n' revver goes jogging through the woods for pastures new.\nDead by Daylight is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.\nThe post Is Leatherface getting the chop in Dead by Daylight? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Then, hold the shield button, press A, and view the regular map. Go to the rune list, and select the Camera Rune while scrolling back to the map. The glitch will essentially show the compendium constantly on-screen while it is active, so you know it worked. To get the infinite stamina and invincibility state, there's more to juggle. You can find the full glitch instructions in Gaming Reinvented's video below.\nObviously invincibility is a boon, but infinite stamina is really the golden goose here.

As reported by Deadline, the bombastic-sounding sci-fi flick has entered its reshoot phase, bringing in a new pair of eyes to put the finishing touches to what sounds like a particularly wild cinematic adventure.\nWhile gorehound Eli Roth is credited as the director of the adaptation, the Hostel lensman has left the project at the final hour, as he has finally received the go-ahead to start work on his slasher throwback Thanksgiving — a project that Roth has been trying to get off the ground for well over a decade. Lionsgate has brought in Deadpool's Tim Miller to direct reshoots for Borderlands, with Deadline reporting that situation is extremely amicable between all parties.\nBased on the pulpy video game series, Borderlands features an all-star cast as the band of rag-tag reprobates on the search for hidden treasure in a desolate and dystopian universe. As we have previously reported, the new film stars Cate Blanchett as world-weary outlaw Lillith, Kevin Hart as disgraced mercenary Roland, Jamie Lee Curtis as the unpredictable scientist Tannis, Ariana Greenblatt as cutesy bomb-lovin' maniac Tiny Tina manic explosives expert Tiny Tina, (along with her protector, Krieg (Florian Munteanu). The party of anti-heroes will be joined by wise-ass robot Claptrap who will be voiced by Jack Black.\nBorderlands, as an incredibly visual franchise, has a lot of potential for its big-screen transition. With capable hands both behind and in front of the camera, it could prove to be a pretty darn entertaining venture. Projects such as these are not always the sum of their parts, but here's hoping that the finished film offers an authentically chaotic slice of interstellar action when its raggedy curtain finally rises.\nThe post Borderlands movie brings in Deadpool’s Tim Miller for reshoots appeared first on Destructoid.",

The fans had been starting to feel a little sorry for her in recent weeks, as she had been yet to rack up a splatfest victory when compared to her colorful co-hosts, so it's nice to see this particular Deep Cut band member finally have their moment of glory.\nCongratulations to the hard-paintin' players of Team Sweet. Make sure that you remember to go and pick up your rewards from the town square, oh, and make sure that you remember to brush your teeth three times a day. All of the sugar comes with one helluva price.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonJP/status/1612270617428123648?s=20&t=58ojjrwyAJ7Lg0L0va5-6Q\nThe post Team Sweet creams opposition in Splatoon 3 splatfest appeared first on Destructoid.",

There is just no competition when it comes to creating authentic, microtransaction-laden sports titles. Of course, not everyone cares about sports games for their realism.

Players control a lone ship, piloting through the stars and taking on the invading forces of Galaga. Building upon Galaxian's award-winning action, Galaga offered an improved audio/video package, as well as cool new features such as the famous \"Tractor Beam\" enemy, and the ability for both the player and the enemy to morph into boosted variants of themselves.\nCheck out the classic interstellar action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29VVkfuXkVI&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays\nDesigned and developed by a small team within Namco, led by Shigeru Yokoyama, Galaga far surpassed the company's expectations, gaining the attention of the executives, which lead to increased efforts in marketing and shipping of the finished product. Galaga was a global smash on release, and would continue to be a mainstay of arcade centers well through the crash and into the late '80s. A gaming icon, Galaga has popped up in multiple movies — including WarGames, The Karate Kid, and The Avengers — and has even had an extinct species of prehistoric shark named after it!\nNot a bad legacy at all for some old-school pew-pew action.\nGalaga is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s iconic shmup Galaga jets into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

OPUS: Prism Peak is a new game from SIGONO, and it's taking a look through a camera lens for its story.\nSIGONO has developed several different narrative adventures under the OPUS banner, stretching back to 2016's OPUS: The Day We Found Earth. The Taiwanese studio found some breakout success with 2021's OPUS: Echo of Starsong, which received both audience critical acclaim, and found its way to the Switch with the Full Bloom Edition.\nWith OPUS: Prism Peak, the studio seems like its looking towards the camera for a new perspective. With the tagline \"Capture the moment, then learn to let go,\" it certainly seems poised for some powerful emotions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdMesmRJRNQ\nAccording to its Steam page, OPUS: Prism Peak is an adventure where choices will lead to diverging endings, as you play a photographer lost in an ethereal realm. You'll have to use your camera to uncover mysteries and find a way home through all of it.\nThe camera eye\nNot much more information has been shared just yet, but the premise alone is very intriguing. The camera has become a cool way of viewing video game worlds, whether on the arcade-like railways of Pokemon Snap or snapping shots of the final days in Umurangi Generation.\nWith a team like SIGONO behind it, OPUS: Prism Peak could be another one to watch in the realm of camera-based adventure. Hopefully we'll hear more about this project soon. Meanwhile, that leaves plenty of time to check out the other OPUS games.\nThe post OPUS: Prism Peak is the next narrative adventure from SIGONO appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We all scream for Scream Tail\nThe competitive battling scene in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet has been fascinating to watch. As new strategies have formed around the monsters introduced in Generation 9, top-tier battlers have had their work cut out for them trying to counter the emerging threats. Who could have guessed that Maushold had some of the highest damage potential in the game? Or how about Murkrow becoming one of the most used Pokemon?\nAs it turns out, the competitive scene faces another significant shakeup. Courtesy of Serebii, Paradox Pokemon will officially be removed from the ban list when Series 2 of Scarlet & Violet’s Ranked Battle modes begin on February 1st. This includes 14 endgame monsters that feature near-legendary base stats and powerful abilities. Even one Pokemon has the potential to change the metagame completely, so the addition of Paradox Pokemon will almost assuredly send ripples throughout the scene. Smogon, a hub for fan driven competitive Pokemon play, already ruled two of these Pokemon too powerful for its popular 6v6 singles format.\n[caption id=\"attachment_357146\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nSome still can't join\nParadox Pokemon will be the only new monsters in Series 2. Tera Raid exclusives like Charizard and Cinderace are still off the table for Ranked Battles. Furthermore, the Ruinous Quartet and Legendary Pokemon remain off-limits. Still, we’re bound to see entirely new strategies emerge with these monsters entering the fold. Pokemon that have seen no usage so far may become valuable strictly to counter these new threats.\nPokemon Scarlet & Violet have been critically contentious, but the interest in the official competitive scene is as strong as it has ever been. Even non-battlers can have fun watching how Paradox Pokemon fit into high-end play. Series 2 will run until March 31st, 2023.\nThe post Paradox Pokemon will be legal in Scarlet & Violet competitive play soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

But if you can't wait that long, there's also a demo arriving for One Piece Odyssey next week to tide you over until launch.\nProducer Katsuaki Tsuzuki announced in a new video today that a One Piece Odyssey demo will go live on January 10, just ahead of its January 13 launch date.\nThe demo will cover roughly the first couple hours of One Piece Odyssey, and save data from the demo will transfer over to the full game. It will follow Luffy and the crew washing up on the island where Odyssey takes place, coming face-to-face with new obstacles to overcome, and likely plenty of RPG battles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bBWs1dYFwk\nTsuzuki says the demo will highlight specific parts of what makes Odyssey a bit different, including its RPG bend towards tactical battles rather than action-heavy fights. The producer does note that since RPGs tend to have various elements unlock gradually over time, not all of the features can be discovered in the demo version.\nSpecifically, the memory worlds shown so far won't be in the demo. These are areas that let the Straw Hat Pirates revisit pieces of their past, going back to old memories of places to relive them. Those will be available after the demo version.\nSetting sail\nWhile it's a short span of time between demo and launch, this is at least a good chance to try out One Piece Odyssey to see if it's for you. While One Piece is no stranger to more action-oriented adaptations, Odyssey dives into the realm of RPGs. It's an interesting twist, and one that actually has me—an anime and RPG fan who doesn't normally vibe with One Piece—fairly interested.\nThe chance to try it out will arrive on January 10. Otherwise, One Piece Odyssey sets off on January 13 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post One Piece Odyssey is getting a demo just before its launch date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Her abilities aren't difficult to use which makes them viable for players of all skill ranges, plus she has great survivability and can deal good damage when it's needed. When Overwatch 2 dropped, however, Moira took on a new life with the five-player teams, and most will say these changes weren't for the best. A whole host of players decided they were tired of healing and wanted to use her as a glorified damage dealer. This is where the DPS Moira controversy began, and it's only snowballed from there.\nFast forward to now, and Blizzard released some new patch notes announcing a buff to the notorious Irish scientist. Now \"dealing damage with Biotic Orb now restores a small amount of Biotic Energy,\" or for laymen like me, when you deal damage with the purple ball it regenerates some of the yellow healing stuff you spray on your teammates. I guess the idea is that since players are going full DPS Moira anyway, they might as well make it easier to give your teammates more healing.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1611142281775484928\nI'm fairly skeptical that this change is going to be good in the long run, but that might be my knee-jerk reaction to hearing about another Moira buff. I want to say I trust that Blizzard knows what they're doing, but as of late my confidence in them has been waning. It'll be a waiting game to see how this buff affects play, and whether the devs will have to come back with a nerf in the near future.\nThese patch notes also detail the new Greek-themed arcade event Battle for Olympus, the new competitive season starting on January 10, and other balance changes for characters like Junker Queen, Zarya, and Brigitte.\n[Featured Image via Blizzard Entertainment]\nThe post Overwatch 2 patch notes announce Moira buff and players aren’t too happy appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was a great trailer, people were excited, and then fast forward nearly a decade later, and the game is still in development.  \nFirst revealed back in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in development at Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, with Dead Island developer Techland having parted ways with the property to work on Dying Light. Publisher Deep Silver handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, and then, in 2019, the company announced that Homefront: The Revolution developer Dambuster Studios would be developing Dead Island 2. It's now 2023 and Dambuster's Dead Island 2 is due out in April, finally. \n\n\nDambuster revealed its new Dead Island 2 last year and…",

Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.\nWhile not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.\nWhile the superhero films of today are often criticall…",

I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). \nLove it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new.

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.\nIn a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open.

These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the \"official reveal trailer\" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. \nCheck out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 \"the year of PayDay 3.\" Here's hoping that holds true. \nWhat do you hope PayDay 3 brings to the franchise?

Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. \nNow, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this \"first half of 2023\" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.\n\"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023,\" the support page reads.\nThis isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. \nWhile waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year. \nDo you think Starfield will get delayed again?

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nHow do you want to see the Metal Gear Solid series return?

After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.",

The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.\n\n\nAs promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.\nAperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game.

The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush.

Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.\nWith the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...",

Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die.

When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon.

As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

          "description": "Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!\nPublished in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. \nA new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
