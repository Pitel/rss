In stark contrast to the Wii U days when even established developers had trouble getting their games on Nintendo platforms, the weekly update is now filled with games that would have been unthinkable just one console generation ago.\nFor all my moaning to come, I'll make it clear up front that I'm not advocating going back to those dark days - the breadth and quantity of experiences you can download from the eShop is one of the great strides forward Nintendo made this gen. The problem that needs addressing is one of content management in an overcrowded storefront; for every promising-looking game and genuine gem, there are five cynical, bottom-of-the-barrel releases obscuring it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After all, Sony’s PS Vita was all but dead by that point, and despite the 3DS managing to reverse its fortunes after a swift price drop in its first year, many claimed that the rise of mobile gaming would spell the end of handheld consoles.\nYet the Switch proved the naysayers wrong and, if anything, ignited a renewed interest in handhelds the likes of which we haven’t seen in years. Mobile gaming has fallen by the wayside (somewhat - though Nintendo properties have also dipped their toes in the water here), and, we now have a bevvy of powerful handheld consoles to choose from, including the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally X, the Lenovo Legion Go, and many more. Yet despite the growing competition, the Switch has comfortably maintained its position as the king of handheld gaming in 2024.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed \"Queen\" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old \"danchi\" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI. \r\n \nRead more",

They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.\nI'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. \nHow many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe?

If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.\nIt’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying \"we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own\". \"You’re right!\" you respond. \"I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie\". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world.

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.\nObviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion.

It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.\nI'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations.

But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.\nThis is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.\nRead more",

Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair.

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual.

Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts. \r\n \nRead more",

Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.\n$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you're playing a \"PS1-style\" game these days, odds are it's a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io's Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.\nHere to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside \"existential grey\" is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It's a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.\n Read more",

          "description": "Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel.

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

V jeho rámci lze distribuovat vlastní obrazy jako tarball, Appx či skrze Windows Store, nicméně dříve byl problém s příliš restriktivní licencí Microsoftu (nutnost souhlasit s podmínkami obchodu a „podepsat“ vývojářský souhlas). To v současných verzích WSL2 už neplatí, Jeremy konstatuje, že s WSL 2.4.4 a vyššími je usnadněna distribuce vlastních obrazů mimo obchod Microsoftu.",

Head to the water and try to find a golden ripple within the waves. Get your fishing rod and catch this Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab from within it. There's a possibility of getting an extra Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab if you hang out with a buddy who has a fishing specialty. \n\n\nSalt Crystals are found within the waters of Everafter. Fish in a spot other than a ripple to gain Salt Crystals for the recipe. \n\n\nGarlic is an easy ingredient to find in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Head to the Forest of Valor, and you'll see the crop growing within the grass. You can pick up the cooking ingredient from the soil. It has green leaves flowing from the ground. \n\n\nLastly, you can pick any spice for the Arcane Garlic Crab. One of Storybook Vale's spices is Black Pepper, which can be bought from Goofy's Stall in The Elysian Fields from Mythopia. You can buy its seeds from Goofy for 70 Star Coins. It takes an hour and a half to grow.\n\n\nAfter getting all of the ingredients, go to a cooking station in your house or Chez Remy. Once made, you can sell the Arcane Garlic Crab for 1,429 Star Coins or eat it for 3,265 Energy. \n\nThe post How to make Arcane Garlic Crab in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since it is Uncommon, it isn't the easiest resource to find, but if you know where to look, they aren't difficult to obtain.\n\n\nWhere to get Feathers in Towers of Aghasba\n\n\nObtaining Feathers in any reasonable amount will require you to sacrifice precious Amity, because the most common source of them is by hunting animals. While I have not found every single creature roaming the wilds of Aghasba, I have found a number that has a chance to drop Feathers when hunted and killed. \n\n\nYour first instinct to find Feathers may be to look for birds flying in the sky, but the easiest way to obtain them actually comes from a slow-roaming creature on land. The chubby Fuzzyfin has a decently high chance of dropping Feathers, and they are very easy to hunt due to how slow they are. They also don't have a large health pool, able to be slain with two Flint Arrows, the weakest type. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFuzzyfins are by far the easiest way to obtain Feathers en mass because they are a common animal found in Tropical Ecosystems, which you will have access to just by following the Towers of Aghasba's main story quest. They roam this Ecosystem at all times of the day and are naturally curious creatures meaning they will not flee from you once approached. Also, if you really want to get efficient with hunting them down, use Lectuce to lure them into groups for easy pickings. Just don't kill too many of them, or you will suffer significant Amity loss, something you want to avoid.\n\nThe post How to get Feathers in Towers of Aghasba appeared first on Destructoid.",

Lately, EA Sports has dropped some expensive SBCs as part of the Thunderstruck promo, and the community will hope for a few reasonably priced ones.\n\n\nOnce we have more leaks, they will be added to the list mentioned here.

The easiest way to get access to information on everything is through their community channels. Here’s how to access the Anime Power Defense Trello.\n\n\nHow to Find the Anime Power Defense Trello\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere are all of Anime Power Defense’s community channels where you can get the latest info on the game:\n\n\n\nOfficial Anime Power Defense Trello.\n\n\nAPD Discord Server.\n\n\nCommunity Anime Power Defense Wiki.\n\n\nAPD Roblox Community.\n\n\n\nFor clear-cut and organized information on the game, I highly recommend that you check out the Trello board first. There, you can find every piece of content and mechanic in the game sorted by category. Examples include:\n\n\n\nInfo on different currencies.\n\n\nMissions.\n\n\nAll rewards.\n\n\nAll Game Modes.\n\n\nUpdates.\n\n\nAll Units are sorted by rarity.\n\n\nAll Skins.\n\n\nAll Powers.\n\n\nAll Items.\n\n\nAll Emotes.\n\n\nInformation on all lobby stations.\n\n\nUnit tier lists.\n\n\nAny previous events.\n\n\n\nThe APD Wiki holds the same type of content but goes in-depth to explain each unit or game mode instead of just listing them. Both are run by the community, so you can expect regular updates on everything as they’re highly active on both platforms.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re not looking for technical objective information and are looking for a more subjective approach, check out their Discord. The community gathers there to discuss strategies, best units, farming methods, and a lot more. This is also where you can ask specific questions you might have in both the General and Questions-and-Help channels.\n\n\nLastly, Discord is also where you can check out the latest updates, announcements, and patch notes. I’d recommend staying up to date on these for any giveaways that might pop up. Speaking of free stuff, codes can be found here, too.

          "description": "In this modern gaming era, we kind of just accept that new releases need a lot of tinkering post-launch, and STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is no different. \n\n\nHaving spent a decade and a half in development, the long-awaited sequel to the cult survival horror FPS series is doing pretty well so far, with a current meta score of 73. But it evidently still needs work (as most modern games do).\n\n\nWithin the past week, we've already had two patches being sent out for both the console and PC versions of STALKER 2, and now a third one has started rolling out. GSC Game World is evidently keeping a close eye on the game and player feedback, as Patch 1.0.3 comes just four days after 1.0.2.\n\n\n\n\nThis update seems to target issues with crashes and memory leaks, specifically fixing multiple \"ACCESS_VIOLATION_ERROR\" and \"LowLevelFatalError\" issues. Whatever all those words mean.\n\n\nFixes to missions as well\n\n\nAdditionally, the patch also plugs some issues with the AI, including one in which NPCs would \"block the doors during the Back to the Slag Heap mission.\" Speaking of missions, there have been a few fixes in that region as well, though the patch notes have blanked some of the specifics, presumably to save from potential spoilers.\n\n\nThere was also an issue with saves, in which some people were finding their save files were missing after a hard reset of their Xbox or PC. The new update should fix this for anyone who has experienced it.\n\n\nLook, it's not for me to say whether three patches in less than a week is a good thing or not. On the one hand, it shows that GSC is evidently on the case when it comes to reacting to issues and feedback. On the other, it does go back on the developer's claim that, prior to release, STALKER 2 had gone gold, suggesting it was fit for release. In any case, one can't help but suspect Patch 1.0.4 is just around the corner, for good or ill.\n\nThe post STALKER 2 has already had its third patch – let’s see how things are going appeared first on Destructoid.",

Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "Nevím, co je \"legálně\" zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat \"dokumentem\", ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)",

          "description": "Dokument, který je profesionálně natočen, tzn. má tempo a atmosféru, je přehledný a dobře se na něj dívá. Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)",
