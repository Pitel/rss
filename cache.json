          "description": "Link's Re-awakening?\nIf you've been longing for an official remake of the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, then chances are you'll have a pretty hefty wait on your hands. Thankfully, then, you can at least assuage your pain by checking out the latest gameplay video of an unofficial remake from fan Lloyd Empty (thanks, Wccftech). It's been up for a little while at this point, but hey, it's never too late to highlight excellent projects like this.\nClocking in at just over 20 minutes, the video showcases the game from the beginning, albeit with some interesting alterations to the structure and dialogue. Link will no longer receive a sword from the Old Man; instead, you need to venture into the basement and solve some simple puzzles before you can get yourself equipped.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You can play it on Steam now for under a tenner, if you like, but one fan has gone a step further and ported the game over to the 3DS.\nAs spotted by TheGamer, the mod was created by MrHuu with details posted on GBATemp. You'll need to own a legal copy of the original game to migrate the relevant files over to the 3DS (which, of course, needs to be modded), but overall, it sounds like a relatively painless way to play the game on something that isn't the Steam Deck.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The studio was founded in October 2023 after Avalanche acquired and integrated Monster Closet, who were themselves founded in 2021 by former developers of such headliners as Halo, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed.  Avalanche's New York studio, meanwhile, dates back to 2011. \r\n \nRead more",

Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. \r\n\n\r\nI am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and \"small interactive moments\" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.\r\n \nRead more",

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.\n Read more",

It's a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.\r\n\r\nInstead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations. I've played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you'll find some thoughts from my time with it below.\n Read more",

The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. \nRead more",

Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know.

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer.

It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either.

Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.\nAnd what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.\nRead more",

You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.\nRead more",

          "description": "This year's major international tournament is right around the corner, and that means a massive new patch is on the way for EA FC 24. Here's when you can get your hands on the Euro 2024 update. \n\n\nIf you're a long-time FIFA fan, you'll remember the incredible World Cup and Euros modes that EA used to drop. Back in the day, they were essentially an additional Ultimate Team, allowing you to build a squad of the best players at the competition. \n\n\nEA Sports has been unusually quiet about what the Euro 2024 patch will include, but we finally know when we'll be able to jump into the game and play it. \n\n\nCould this be Ronaldo's last major tournament for Portugal? Image via EA Sports\n\n\nEA FC 24 Euro 2024 update release date\n\n\nEA Sports FC 24's Euro 2024 update will be released on Thursday, June 6, 2024. This was confirmed by EA Sports themselves on June 4, telling players to \"get ready for a festival of football.\"\n\n\n\n\nEA FC 24 Euro 2024 update countdown\n\n\nUnfortunately, EA Sports hasn't given us an exact time of when the update will go live in-game. Most content updates, such as Team of the Week, go live at 6 pm UK time, so we've set the countdown timer below to that time. We'll be sure to update it if we get any new information. \n\n\n\nWhat's included in EA FC 24's Euro 2024 update?\n\n\nTruthfully, we don't know. EA Sports have been pretty secretive and not announced anything to do with the promo. We expect that it will be linked to Ultimate Team, and likely feature new cards based on players competing in the tournament. \n\n\nThe promo image shows Euro 2024 players including Jude Bellingham and Virgil Van Dijk standing in their new kits for the tournament, so we expect those to be updated too. \n\n\nIt's also possible we'll see updates to the tournament mode offline too, perhaps with the official graphics package that will be used in this year's edition of the European Championship. \n\nThe post When does EA FC 24’s Euro 2024 update release?

Image via Activision\n\n\n\"Yep, one-tap weapons should be high risk, high reward, but nearly all of them in this game aren't,\" agreed Grand-Article4214. \"There are barely any risks for snipers, especially since they aren't balanced to 150 health compared to every other gun in the game.\"\n\n\nIcy-Computer7556 explained that they feel the gun has \"ridiculous aim assist,\" stating: \"Anything with one-shot potential close or far should instantly be aim assist free. They did that in previous CoDs and it worked well. Skilled players kept sniping and sh*tters gave up because they realized they didn't have the skill to just bloop everyone every second. I'm not saying I'm a good sniper, but the fact that it can slow down or pull on a gun like that? It's f**king crazy.\"\n\n\nFor some though, the idea of nerfing the Kar98k is pointless because something else will take its place, with conanwongmkii writing: \"It's either the Kar98k, the Wardens, or the MORS sniper. Pick your poison, you can't escape it.\"\n\n\nPersonally, I find the Kar98k to be unbelievable in other people's hands, but in mine it feels like I get nothing but hitmarkers. I've never been a great sniper though, so it may be my fault. Still, getting one-shot killed over and over again by people running the Kar98k is infuriating, and I'd love to see some balancing changes too.\n\nThe post MW3 players are begging Sledgehammer to nerf ‘broken’ Kar98k appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "EA Sports has announced an EA FC 24 maintenance, which will take place on June 5.\n\n\nThis maintenance comes at a time when the Ultimate TOTS promo is still active in the Ultimate Team mode. However, EA Sports has some big plans for the upcoming weeks, and this server update might be in preparation for that. Among other possible content going live in the future, a separate Euro 2024 tournament is also expected by the fans. But before that, the community will have to bear with the upcoming update.\n\n\nWhen will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) begin?\n\n\nEA Sports has officially announced details of the upcoming maintenance on the game's official X account. According to that post, the servers will be taken down at 8 a.m. UTC/1 a.m. PDT/4 a.m. ET, and matchmaking across all game modes will be stopped 30 minutes prior to that.\n\n\nThis maintenance will apply to the game across all platforms. However, only EA FC 24 will be impacted by this update, so those of you still playing older releases like FIFA 23 can continue to play without any worry.\n\n\n\n\nWhen will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) end?\n\n\nThe servers will be restored once the maintenance is concluded. As per the available schedule, June 5's maintenance will end at 2 p.m. UTC/7 a.m.PDT/10 a.m. ET. If there are no more delays, the servers will be down for approximately six hours. This is certainly one of the longer server maintenance periods in recent times.\n\n\nWhile the maintenance is live, players won't be able to access game modes like Ultimate Team, which rely on online matchmaking. Career Mode will remain a playable option, as there's no need for the internet to conduct matches.\n\nThe post EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5): When will the servers come back appeared first on Destructoid.",

That said, the workaround solution does require a little extra effort from affected players.\n\n\nDestiny 2 expansion launches, as with many MMO expansion launches, are frequently filled with long waits due to player influx and error codes. While Bungie tries to make errors a bit lighthearted by naming them Plum or Honeydew, these sometimes time-consuming network or population issues can be annoying. That said,  once players actually get into the game, frustrations typically subside. That's not the case with this Prismatic bug, as it prevents players from acquiring the Subclass, which is needed throughout the campaign.\n\n\nHow to get Prismatic if missed\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you realize that you've completed the first campaign mission in The Final Shape and don't have access to the Prismatic Subclass, you'll have to replay that first mission once more. Additionally, you'll need to go it alone to ensure things play out properly the second time around. While this may not be the news affected players want to hear, the bright side is that there is a solution, and all it requires is a little more time.\n\n\nOf course, the best option is to hope to circumvent the issue altogether. For the best results, players shouldn't try joining other players while the mission is in progress or start it with players who already have the new Subclass. If players aren't sure if their run is affected, they'll know for sure if there isn't a large Prismatic interactable just before approaching the Rally flag for the final encounter.\n\nThe post What to do if you don’t get Prismatic after the first Destiny 2: The Final Shape mission appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fortunately, one new Resonator is on the horizon, thanks to a new update. Here's when to expect Yinlin to release in Wuthering Waves.\n\n\nWuthering Waves Yinlin release date, explained\n\n\nAs per the official announcement from Kuro Games, the much-anticipated Yinlin will be unleashed on June 6, 2024, at 10:00 (UTC +8). This is a part of Wuthering Waves 1.0's new content, setting the stage for Version 1.1. As a special treat, you'll have the exclusive opportunity to delve into her Companion Story, Solitary Path, and uncover her intriguing journey.\n\n\nImage via Kuro Games\n\n\nOnce the update is live, Yinlin can be pulled from her Resonator Convene event, When Thunder Pours. Like any other gacha game, it won't always be guaranteed, so it may take a few tries.\n\n\nBased on Yinlin's artwork, she is a 5-star character who harnesses Electro powers. She was once a Jinzhou patroller, but now her position remains a mystery. What we do know, however, is that she excels in uncovering crimes using her exploitative skills. She also has been known to have a \"heart of gold\" as long as she deems people trustworthy.\n\n\nAlthough Yinlin has yet to make it to Wuthering Waves, many players are preparing for her debut with Ascension materials. This includes items like the Unwarranted Feather and the Group Abomination Tacet Core. So, if you want to prepare for her launch, ensure you've collected these materials for fast character upgrades.\n\nThe post When does Yinlin release in Wuthering Waves? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Upon starting The Final Shape, you'll be prompted with a choice between two modes. To help with this decision, we'll explain what Legend and Normal modes are in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.\n\n\nDestiny 2: The Final Shape modes, explained\n\n\nAfter launching The Final Shape main campaign, you'll have two choices: 'Be Brave' or 'Be Legend'. Brave (Destiny 2 Normal campaign) is designed for any type of player, whether you are a beginner or prefer solo runs. It can also be played with friends if your group wants something a bit more casual. Having played this version myself, it's still challenging to do, especially with solo missions. \n\n\nHowever, those who want a challenge and bonus rewards should opt for Legendary mode. Missions will be much more difficult than Brave mode, upping the ante with an enemy's performance. It's best to choose this mode if you are an experienced player. You may have seen something similar to this with Lightfall's Legendary mode, which also increases difficulty.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you conquer all the missions in the Legendary campaign, a sense of triumph awaits you as you earn an Exotic Armor and Gear Bundle (1960 Power). In addition to this, the Tessalation Exotic Fusion Rifle will be given to users who pre-ordered Destiny 2: The Final Shape.\n\n\nBoth modes offer the same main campaign storyline, starting with the Transmigration mission. What's more, you have the power to alter the difficulty at any time, tailoring the game to your skill level and preferences. And if you're up for a challenge, completed campaign missions can be replayed with a higher difficulty, allowing you to push your limits and reap greater rewards.\n\nThe post Destiny 2: The Final Shape Legend vs Normal Modes, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The 2024 World Series of Warzone has officially kicked off, and it didn't take long for chaos to ensue in the first round of qualifying matches. \n\n\nWarzone pro Fifakill posted a clip on Twitter of CHOWH and his teammates getting killed by a loadout drop during a World Series of Warzone EU qualifying match. Despite driving in an LTV, one of the best-armored vehicles in the battle royale, the trio stood no chance against a loadout drop that fell from the sky. Upon driving into the crate, the vehicle blew up and all three players got downed. To add insult to injury, the squad got finished off by an airstrike. CHOWH could do nothing but sit in disbelief as he saw his team fall victim to quite an unfortunate turn of events. \n\n\n\n\nBubbleCT and his trio called in the loadout drop, and he responded, \"Shout out to our loadout, lmao.\" Bubble had no intention of using the loadout drop of a weapon, but he certainly won't apologize, as every kill matters in the World Series of Warzone. From June 4-12, NA and EU qualifiers take place. Out of the 80 teams for both regions, only 68 will move on based on their performances throughout 15 matches. \n\n\nThat group of 68 is divided even further based on their performance during the qualifying stages, so every game matters. Hence, losing one of those 15 matches like this is unquestionably frustrating. Unfortunately for CHOWH, his trio currently sits in 30th place with 28 points after the first five matches. And that's before the second group of 40 teams play their first five matches. Luckily there are still 10 matches left, and CHOWH has plenty of time to regroup. \n\nThe post Warzone team meets a fiery end thanks to one unfortunate loadout drop appeared first on Destructoid.",

The company’s Montreal studio will be hit particularly hard – 70 of the cut employees will be coming from there. \n\n\nUp until this year, Behaviour was experiencing some incredible growth. The company’s own press release acknowledges that it’s more than doubled in size over the past years, going from 575 to 1,300 employees. “Over the same period, the greater gaming industry has also witnessed remarkable growth,” the company writes, adding, “However, the industry’s unprecedented popularity has also led to unprecedented competition.”\n\n\nAccording to the press release, these changes are aimed at helping the company focus on its primary goals to “lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment.” To that end, Behaviour says that the restructuring won’t affect its work on Dead by Daylight, which will continue to see regular updates and franchise crossovers.\n\n\nAt this point it seems almost unnecessary to point out that this is just the latest in a string of layoffs that’s been snaking through the industry since before the start of the year. Companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Unity – to name just a few – have all been hit, and the total number of jobs lost in 2024 alone is already reaching 2023’s depressing 9,000. This restructuring from Behaviour may seem like small change in comparison, but every job lost is a life disrupted, and seeing all these losses piled together is staggering. \n\nThe post Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour is laying off up to 95 workers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the OTK Game Expo, Mad Mushroom has revealed Splodey, a die-and-retry game in the vein of Celeste and Super Meat Boy. Developed by Send It Studios, the twist here is that there is no jump button. Also, you can buy and play it right now for PC.\n\n\nThis sounds like a sidescrolling die-and-retry game based around Quake-like rocket jumping. As I mentioned, there’s no jump button, but you use potion-based explosives to destroy the environment around you and propel yourself through the air. In the trailer, it shows off the system of using a directional arrow to aim your potion and positioning it in a way that will send the protagonist in the direction you want. It’s hard to fully glean the feel from just video, but it seems like something that would get better with practice.\n\n\n\n\nThere isn’t much information provided about the plot, but Splodey features 100 stages split across four worlds. There’s also a 25-level bonus world and a further 16 secret levels. I suppose the secret is their location (found through exploration) and not the fact that they exist. Because I just told you.\n\n\nThere’s also a speedrun challenge for Splodey starting today and running until June 18th. It requires you to upload or stream footage of your feats using the tag #SplodeyChallenge.\n\n\nI have to tell you; as much as the trailer makes Splodey look like a capable and well-executed take on the genre, I just don’t enjoy die-and-retry games. And that even goes for beloved titles like Celeste and VVVVVV. There are a few, such as Hotline Miami, that appeal to me despite their sub-genre, but for the most part, they don’t do much for me.\n\n\nIf it does something for you, maybe check it out. Splodey is available today for PC at the price of $12.99 ($9.75 after a launch-week discount.)\n\nThe post Splodey is an explosive die-and-retry speedrun game available today appeared first on Destructoid.",

It shows a sunset cityscape with a silhouette of a figure, the scene emblazoned with Heart Machine's logo.

The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.\nThe new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.\n\n\nMetal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. \nWhen first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC.

She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. \nKena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+\n\n\nWe awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, \"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring.

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.",

In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6.

It revealed this during today's State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. \nThis follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while \"tentpole\" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. \nAs you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: \n\n\nAccording to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. \nGod of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review. \nAre you going to check out this game out on PC later this year?

However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.\n\n\nBallad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: \"You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.\"\nIn addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. \nBallad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.",

          "description": "PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal?

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far?

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.\nYou can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.\n\n\nHive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today.

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",
