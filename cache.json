          "description": "Here be dragons.\nA couple of years ago, it was notable when the Switch remakes of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were developed not in-house by Game Freak, but by a smaller Japanese support studio called ILCA. That remake project was actually ILCA’s first crack at being the lead developer on a game, and it soon followed this up early last year with One Piece Odyssey, an original JRPG based on the long-running franchise about wacky pirates. Now this release has finally made its way over to the Switch, and we’re happy to report that it’s made the jump almost entirely intact. Though it’s taken a bit of a visual hit, One Piece Odyssey still proves to be an enjoyable and accessible release that's a welcome addition to the Switch’s considerable RPG library.\nThe narrative in One Piece Odyssey is a sort of ‘bottle episode’ that follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates crew after they shipwreck upon a mysterious island called Waford. Shortly after arriving, a mysterious figure takes away their power (cutely represented by everyone dropping from level 40 down to 1) and locks it away in various magical cubes scattered across the island. Even when they recover some of the cubes, the only way they can unlock the power contained within is through diving into illusory worlds crafted from their memories and reconquering trials they once faced, although events play out a little differently this time around because of how ‘fuzzy’ memory can be. The crew thus sets out through worlds based on the memories of some of their greatest struggles to reclaim their power and get to the bottom of what’s going on with this strange island.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After sinking 15 hours into The Gentlebros' latest adventure, it is safe to say everything about Cat Quest III is fantastic.\nThe adventure began with us choosing our feline Purrivateer and arriving in the Purribean, an archipelago filled with Pi-rats to defeat who are on the hunt for the North Star Treasure. With our spirit companion, who is also searching for the North Star Treasure, we piloted our ship and ventured across land and sea to find the mythical treasure, defeating Pirate Lords in a variety of dungeons and uncovering a myriad of secrets along the way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Entry to Valhalla secured.\nSince the release of Volgar the Viking in 2013, fans have been itching for a full sequel to the Rastan-inspired action platformer for over a decade at this point. Now the time has finally arrived. Thanks to a partnership between developer Crazy Viking Studios and retro specialist Digital Eclipse, we can step back into the boots of Volgarr as he embarks on a quest that will prove more deadly than any he’s faced. The result is a game that, frankly, feels improved in just about every conceivable way, making Volgarr the Viking II not only one of the best 2D action platformers on Switch, but one of the best of all time.\nLet’s start with the obvious: Volgarr II is brutal. There have been several adjustments made to make the game more approachable to newcomers, which we’ll get into in more detail later, but you should know that this isn’t for the faint of heart. You will die in Volgarr II, and you will die a lot. Like the original, getting through each stage is an exercise in learning the layout, anticipating every enemy position, and observing their attack patterns and weaknesses. When entering each new area for the first time, attempting to storm through as quickly as you can is simply not an option; you can be sure that there will be something lying in wait to bring your journey to a swift and bloody end.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new \"omnimovement\" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.\r\n \nRead more",

I think about this quite often, actually, as someone whose largely offline friends (or Fortnite/FIFA pals) ask me to recommend them a game that's good or interesting. Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.\nAll of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.\nRead more",

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.\r\n\n\r\nSin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy \"microsociety\" in which every community \"has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal\". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing \"fus roh dah\".\r\n \nRead more",

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like \"Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y.\" or \"Hyperion's Wild Rumpus\" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.\r\n\n\r\nLike Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail.

Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits.

I was just being a (wildly charismatic, dashing) idiot.\nIn my brief time with massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout London, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”\n“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services are crap!” I was having a good time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.\nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.\nRead more",

No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation.

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

This threat, combined with on-the-fly tactical consider-me-do's like utilising cover and keeping rock-paper-scissors matchups in your favour ends up spawning something quite distinct. Please, do stomp on, preferably with less hypens for all our sakes.\nRead more",

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree. For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.\nRead more",

          "description": "Horka polevila, ale žár nadšení Strahováků z techniky nepolevuje! Za poslední měsíc se stalo několik událostí doslova kosmického charakteru. Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!\r\n\r\nZa HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač \"zaseknout\" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.\r\n\r\nSoftware ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.\r\n\r\nJak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

However, to access the course in BR mode, you'll need to find special statues known as Bean Idols, which only appear in a certain area. Hfere's how to find Bean Idols during the Fortnite X Fall Guys event.\n\n\nBean Idol locations in Fortnite X Fall Guys event\n\n\nBean Idols are golden statues that spawn exclusively in Classy Courts. As you exit the Battle Bus and glide toward this landmark, you'll spot the obstacle course in the sky, with light beams surrounding it. Each light shows the location of a Bean Idol.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you're already on the ground in another region, you can run over toward the obstacle course and Fall Guys character icon on your map near Classy Courts. As you approach the area, you'll spot the lights in the sky, allowing you to find the statues and participate in the obstacle course.\n\n\nWhat do Bean Idols do in the Fortnite X Fall Guys event?\n\n\nBean Idols are the key to participating in the Battle Royale version of the Fall Guys obstacle course. Once you interact with the statue, your character will turn into a Fall Guys bean. A timer will begin immediately after, giving you a limited time to complete the obstacle course to maximize your rewards. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlthough other players won't directly hurt you during it, they can sabotage your efforts and slow you down. You can also get caught in the Storm if you're unlucky with circle spawns, so keep an eye on your map and the Storm timer as you're running the course.\n\n\nYour rewards after completing the Fall Guys obstacle course depend on your time. Earning gold will reward you with valuable, rare weapons and consumables, while lower tiers will give you more common items. Nonetheless, they're great prizes to claim as long as you don't get eliminated shortly after.\n\nThe post How to find Bean Idols in Fortnite X Fall Guys event appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the Prestige Level is still not high enough to attract the biggest talents right away. In fact, schools at this level represent what I call an \"average pick.\" You can have a lot of fun with these schools, and there are some decent choices worth considering in Dynasty mode.\n\n\n10 best 2-star schools to consider in Football 25 Dynasty Mode\n\n\nIn case you aren't aware, the star rating of a school in College Football 25 isn't a grade of its squads.

Oh well, at least we still have plenty of mods to keep us amused.\n\n\nAnd amused I am, thanks to this one from Nexus Mods user SadWeeble in which NPCs in New Vegas literally explode randomly.

          "description": "Dear Villagers and Studio Plane Toast are closer to nailing down a release date for their post-apocalyptic adventure, Caravan SandWitch. It will be out in September for PC, PS5, and Switch. The exact day hasn’t been announced.\n\n\nBased on the name, if you asked me what Caravan SandWitch was, I would have guessed that it was a whimsical food truck game. Not so, as it’s actually a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic exploration game set on the planet Cigalo. It’s post-apocalyptic in the sense that humans ruined the environment, as we’re wont to do. There wasn’t an actual apocalypse there in the cosmic or religious sense.\n\n\n\n\nCaravan SandWitch is billed as a “semi-open” world. It’s a journey, and along the way, you meet folks and help them with their problems. You drive across a “Provence-like” world in a van. There is no combat, no death, no timer. The art style and aesthetic execution look top-notch based on the trailers.\n\n\nIt’s been in development for a while, starting off as a small indie project that was described as an anti-Mad Max. There was also a demo released a while back. From what I hear, it did a good job highlighting the graphics and movement system, but ended abruptly before you got to any real meat. Hopefully, the meat is good.\n\n\nWe’ll find out next month when Caravan SandWitch launches on PC, PS5, and Switch.\n\nThe post Cozy post-apocalyptic exploration game Caravan SandWitch isn’t as delicious as it sounds, out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

The free iOS music streaming tool has millions of happy users, but is branded a parasitic threat by the music industry. Behind the scenes, music industry group IFPI has been working hard to get it removed from the App Store. Apple hasn't taken action thus far but further escalation involving the major labels, YouTube, and a potential lawsuit, were proposed earlier this year.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

The order also requires search engines to deindex blocked domains from search results, which pushes look-a-like platforms to the top making malicious sites more visible. This disproportionately affects inexperienced users, undermines confidence in search engines, and has only a limited effect on those who regularly pirate.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
