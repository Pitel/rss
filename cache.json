This meant that there were some clever physics and cool tricks, yes, but it also meant that (like skating) it was really hard to master. Fortunately for the Switch version, development studio Crea-ture has been working on tweaking the controls and introductory tutorials to get the board rolling as quickly and simply as possible. The publishers state that these changes have produced a \"more balanced learning curve\", so we should be able to get those gnarly tricks down quicker this time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The company's price dropped by around 7% since yesterday's report, and at the time of writing, it currently sits at ¥5,226, which is down from ¥5,624.\nThis drop doesn't come as a huge surprise due to the company's slightly disappointing results, where Nintendo revealed that it's cutting sales forecasts after a decline in year-on-year sales in hardware and software. Other than reducing its year-end forecast for Switch sales again, from 19 million to 18 million, Nintendo is still staying quiet about a successor, despite the console about to enter its seventh year on the market.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The CMA say the buyout “could result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation for UK gamers.” Since these concerns are provisional, both parties will have a chance to respond before the CMA makes its final decision on April 26th. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard believe the deal will encourage competition in the gaming space, rather than hinder it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

For one, it’s huge. It towers above the forest trees and looks like it could easily stomp unwanted visitors to death. When the young witch approaches the towering beast, it bends is legs to sit down, almost burring itself in the earth for her access to the house on top.\nRead more",

Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. \r\n\n\r\nAs I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Allow me to assuage it with exciting news about what the devs have been working on instead. Namely - a complete rework of the Legend classes and perks system; a new top-tier burst Assault Rifle; a rotating playlist of limited time modes, including the new Team Deathmatch mode; improved onboarding for new players; and much more.\nRead more about all the major changes coming with Apex Legends Revelry on Tuesday 14th February below, and join me as I aggressively chew the walls in anticipation of the five new character classes that are about to shake up the Legend meta.\nRead more",

What's not to love? Living in a cute little thatched roof house, tending to your garden, baking bread, sipping magical teas, reading old tomes on the front porch - absolute bliss.\nWitchy Life Story is all about this lifestyle. It’s a fluffy, cosy visual novel where you play as a mischievous witch who is sent to live in a new town called Flora to prove themselves after royally flubbing their training. The town is preparing for a festival and, as the newly appointed town witch, you need to pull your weight by brewing potions, giving tarot readings, and even leading a guided meditation session or two.\nRead more",

          "description": "I hesitate to call Potion Tales a shop sim or retail management game, because the economics of running a figuratively and literally underground magic potion shop seems a secondary concern next to making the potions and deciding whether you want to screw people over or not. If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.\nIn practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you're approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That's all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.\nRead more",

It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.\nBut since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow \"do and be everything\" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.\nRead more",

If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

Like, we’ve all seen that YouTube video showing how deep the sea is and unanimously agree that it’s, like, terrifying? As much as I love relaxing subaquatic city builders and exploring underwater alien worlds, I want games about stuff in the sea that makes my skin crawl to think about. Enter Full Fathom.\nSo, Full Fathom isn’t out yet, or even has an official release date, but I just love the idea and look of this game. Being developed by Daemon House, this is an oceanic survival horror where you’re trapped in a derelict submarine that has sunken to the depths of an abyssal sea. You need to navigate your surroundings and keep the sub up and running to make your way back to civilisation, aka a rusty tin can is your last lifeline.\nRead more",

In addition to a huge client update for the handheld PC, Valve pushed out a Proton Experimental update to fix a crashing problem with games that use the Ubisoft Connect launcher on Steam. \nUbi’s launcher had received an update of its own, sadly one that interfered with the ability of Proton – the layer of software that helps made-for-Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS – to keep it compatible with the Deck. Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks. \nRead more",

Around 50 devs were working on the game before its cancellation earlier this week.

I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.\nIn fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft.

At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.\nRead more",

But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.\nRead more",

When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.\n“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Jedná se o shellový skript ESXiArgs-Recover, který je možné stáhnout na GitHubu. Na většině napadených serverů nedošlo k zašifrování virtuálních disků, ale jen konfiguračních souborů. Proto je možné pomocí skriptu jednoduše znovu vytvořit konfiguraci podle metadat a službu obnovit.",

Od Fedory 35 platí, že pokud si v edici Workstation při úvodním nastavení povolíte zdroje třetích stran, nastaví se vám mezi těmito zdroji také Flathub. Ten k dnešnímu dni nabízí zhruba 2000 aplikací ve formátu Flatpak, mezi nimiž naleznete i ty proprietární, které ve Fedoře nejsou k dispozici. Doteď se ale Flathub nastavoval pouze ve filtrované podobě. Dokud si uživatel sám Flathub nepřidal, měl z tohoto zdroje k dispozici jen krátký seznam schválených aplikací. To se změní s Fedorou 38. FESCo schválilo návrh, podle kterého se po povolení zdrojů třetích stran nastaví nefiltrovaný Flathub. Uživatel tak bude mít po zaškrtnutí jedné volby k dispozici stovky dalších aplikací včetně těch populárních jako Steam, VLC, Chrome nebo Spotify. Oficiální repozitáře Fedory ale budou mít i nadále prioritu. To znamená, že když se bude aplikace nacházet jak v repozitářích Fedory, tak na Flathubu, v GNOME Software bude vždy předvolená verze z Fedory.",

I also acknowledge that games just run longer than they did 25 years ago. Yet replaying A Link to the Past and reaching this critical story moment so quickly was genuinely mindblowing. This game felt massive to me as a kid. Even when I wrote my Zelda list, I still internalized A Link to the Past as a solid 20+ hour adventure. All this time, I thought I wasn’t playing as many games because I was an adult with less free time. Have games really gotten so much longer that my childhood favorites feel minuscule in comparison?\nAfter surveying other retro games and comparing them to recent releases, I realized that …",

While We Wait Here will give you the means to cook their desired last meal, and while you do you’ll hear all their reactions to what’s going on beyond the windows of the greasy spoon. There are multiple endings, but no real game over. You simply do your best while riding out the apocalypse.\nAs someone with an unhealthy interest in life and mortality, this is sadly my exact jam. Maybe blame Majora’s Mask, but a person's reaction to the approach of the absolute unknown is fascinating to me.

          "description": "Hit the orange track\nVelan Studios is working on another mixed reality racing game. Hot Wheels: Rift Rally is a new racing game from the studio behind Mario Kart Live, centered on Mattel's line of miniature cars.\nDue out on March 14 for iOS and PlayStation, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally operates pretty similarly to Velan's Mario Kart Live. Players can set up different gates around their real-world accommodations to create a track, then use the car and built-in camera to race around.\nWhile it's all controlled through the game, you're also driving the car. So it's a pretty solid way to both re-imagine your living room, and keep a high-energy cat occupied.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Q0fYl0pH0\nThe big difference here is that while your car remains the same in the real world, in-game it can morph into different famous Hot Wheels cars. There are mini-games to compete in and stunts to perform, though some of the fun will also be in seeing what that little car can do. I'm not advocating for you to set up any sick jumps or dangerous thrill courses, it's your money. But a childhood spent assembling orange track segments has me thinking about what kind of courses you could concoct for this RC car.\nRallying around the rift\nThere's also a Campaign mode in Hot Wheels: Rift Rally, where different challenge maps and competitions await. Or in Stunt mode, players can drive around without those pesky gates, free to freestyle to their heart's content.\nIt will run you a decent amount for the kit. The standard edition for Hot Wheels: Rift Rally will go for $129.99, while the Collectors Edition adds in a special-edition RC car, extra McLaren Hot Wheels car, and bonus unlockable car for $149.99.\nHot Wheels: Rift Rally races its way onto iOS, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 on March 14, 2023.\nThe post Hot Wheels: Rift Rally is a new mixed reality racer from Mario Kart Live devs appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sort of. Sonic Colors: Ultimate has launched on Steam.\nInitially released for the Wii in 2010, Sonic Colors is one of the series’ games held in higher regard. The 2021 “Ultimate” version refurbishes it for newer consoles, remastering the graphics and soundtrack while also adding some additional features. Destructoid’s own Chris Carter described it as “one of the better ones to trot out.” Yeah! Like a pony!\nBut let’s tug the reins here because reception to the PC port hasn’t been exactly glowing. Steam users are reporting that it’s a pretty rough version filled with “glitches and bugs.” I’ve skimmed through the list of reported issues to see if I could summarize better, but I’ve only succeeded in finding that “everything” is broken. Audio, graphics, UI, and controls. Of course, being on the PC platform means that most people will get a different experience based on minute differences in both the hardware and software environment they’re running.\nHowever, you should also note that Sonic Colors: Ultimate also comes saddled with Denuvo DRM.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3MCqTdsVKc\nIt’s unlikely a patch is coming to fix things anytime soon, as this is the same version as what was released on the Epic Games Store over a year ago, and it’s still in the same rough shape. I’m not suggesting you avoid this release entirely–I’m not your game-mom–just know what you’re potentially getting into.\nSonic Colors: Ultimate is available on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and on PC through the Epic Games Store and Steam.\nThe post Sonic Colors: Ultimate finally crashes onto Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

It turns out a few other games are doing well, too!\nNintendo reports that Splatoon 3 has sold 10.13 million units since its September 2022 launch, firmly placing it just outside of the top 10 list, somewhat in reach of Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee's 15.07 million. It just needs to best two more games to catch up to Splatoon 2, and four more games to crack the top 10. Given how Splatoon games typically have decent tails, it should at least climb a few more spots before it settles in.\nIn the wide world of digital recreational activity, Nintendo Switch Sports commanded a respectable 8.61 million units, putting it directly in the top 20 all-time best-selling Switch game list. This kind of came out of nowhere for me, as I hardly ever hear about it in passing, but there's likely enough nostalgia there for the original Nintendo-branded \"Sports\" series that you just don't ponder on a regular basis.\nBig picture, Nintendo now has 27 games that are million-sellers; with Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Mario Strikers: Battle League, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Pokemon Legends: Arceus joining those ranks in 2022.\nA full breakdown of Nintendo's sales trends for 2022 and part of 2023\n[caption id=\"attachment_361724\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nThe post Splatoon 3 pushes over 10 million units since launch, Switch Sports is right behind it appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo is hosting a tried and true Nintendo Direct on February 8 at 5PM ET, which will run \"roughly 40 minutes.\"\nHere's the full rundown from Nintendo, since I know you Direct-heads love to get the full scoop:\n\"Tune in tomorrow, Feb. 8, at 2 p.m. PT for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching in the first half of 2023.\"\n\nThat's basically everything I already recapped above: with no extra special provisos (like \"X will not be shown\"). 40 minutes is a meaty timeframe, and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom does fit into that \"first half\" bit. For reference, the last proper Direct was held on September 13, 2022.\nAs far as what to expect, we'll likely see a recap of things that were revealed in the last week, like Kirby's Dream Land Switch additions, as well as the long-rumored final release date (or instant drop) of Advance Wars Switch. Fans have been waiting years to hear any major updates for Hollow Knight: Silksong, among other first-party games like Metroid Prime 4 and Pikmin 4.\nEither way, tune in and follow along with the news on Destructoid's front page on February 8.

So what changed?\nWell, interestingly enough, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl dropped off the list entirely, despite holding firm at the number eight slot the last time we checked in. Essentially taking its spot in the top 10, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet shot up to seventh place, while Super Mario Party, Ring Fit Adventure, and Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee refused to leave. The top six best-sellers (below) remain exactly the same.\nIn terms of sales, everything shot up a bit, ranging from 1-4 million more sales since the last September 30 2022 marker, with Mario Kart 8 pushing a remarkable 1.6 million units in that timeframe. You can see why it continues to shoot out DLC! Other top games held on, including Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which will likely continue getting a big bump from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom throughout the year.\nAs for what's next, expect Scarlet & Violet to climb considerably, likely overtaking Pokemon Sword/Shield eventually as the best-selling Pokemon game on Switch. It's a shame Legends still isn't anywhere to be found!\nHere's the full Switch best-seller list as of December 31, 2022\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe - 52 million\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons - 41.59 million\nSmash Ultimate - 30.44 million\nZelda: Breath of the Wild - 29 million\nPokemon Sword/Shield - 25.68 million\nSuper Mario Odyssey - 25.12 million\nPokemon Scarlet/Violet - 20.61 million\nSuper Mario Party - 18.79 million\nRing Fit Adventure - 15.22 million\nPokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee - 15.07 million\nThe post Nintendo updates its Switch best-seller list, as Pokémon Scarlet & Violet sell heaps appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "See Joel and Ellie's next leg of the trip before the Super Bowl\nIf last week's The Last of Us had you eagerly awaiting what's ahead, you won't have to wait quite so long for the next one. Episode 5 of The Last of Us will be streaming a few days earlier, on February 10 at 9 p.m. ET.\nThis perk will be available for both HBO Max users, who will be able to check out the new episode a little bit earlier. It will still make its HBO premiere on Sunday, February 12 at 9 p.m. ET. This is the one and only episode to do so, as the rest will continue to air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1622611081087844352\nWhy the two-day early premiere? Well, no official reason was given in HBO's press release. But those tuned into the sports world already know. This weekend is the Super Bowl, and it looks like HBO might look to avoid a direct clash between its new episode and massive sporting event.\nThough other competition has existed for the Sunday slot, and The Last of Us has won out, it seems like HBO is making an effort to avoid the clash for this particular event. Thus, Episode 5 of The Last of Us will go live a little bit earlier. At least that's less waiting between cliffhangers.\nLast Friday night\nIt's at least a good sign for the series that HBO wants to keep its momentum rolling. The show has garnered general praise, and seems to at least be on the upper-end of the scale compared to most live-action video game adaptations.\nThe first season is expected to run through March 12, which is when its finale airs. It's already been renewed for a second season as well, so HBO really does seem to be betting on The Last of Us.\nMeanwhile, PC fans holding out for the chance to play the first installment themselves are waiting a little longer, as the PC port of The Last of Us Part I has been pushed back further into March.\nThe post PSA: The Last of Us Episode 5 hits streaming earlier this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

This goes back to the ‘80s, with some of the earliest video games to hit the market. I don’t have an explanation for why these titles are often bad. The fact that they have to be rushed to meet the same release date as the movie certainly does no favors. However, my theory is that, when a game already has advertising that comes from a larger industry, why even bother trying to make it good? It’s going to sell on recognition alone.\nWith that in mind, here we have 2004’s Catwoman, based on the film starring Halle Berry. It has the distinction of being based off what is considered by some to be one of the worst big-budget films of all time. It would be really…",

          "description": "Deep into that darkness peering…\nRed Hook Studios has announced that Darkest Dungeon II will end its early access run on Epic Games Store and enter the light on May 8, 2023. The game is a follow-up to 2016’s Darkest Dungeon, a title focused on the mental rigors of dungeon delving.\nRather than simply focus on being an adventuresome RPG, Darkest Dungeon gave your party the glossy sheen of human weaknesses. Instead of being buff and daftly courageous heroes, your group would be affected by the horrors that they saw in the gloom beneath the earth.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/sJ6Gdd-pSPA[/embed]\nDarkest Dungeon II continues the series’ take on stress management but makes wholesale changes to a lot of the system. A focus for a lot of pre-release information is the wagon that you drive to travel the game world, but the combat system has been reworked. A lot has changed alongside that, and a many players voiced their disappointment in 2021 when the early access period launched. While I can’t personally speak to any of the changes that have been made or the quality, I have heard that the devs have been active about collecting feedback and tweaking the game based on that. Hopefully, this meant that the final release in a few months will meet expectations.\nI didn’t play the first Darkest Dungeon because people told me that it’s really depressing. Maybe I should give it a go once I give my therapist a proper warning.\nIf you’re unsure about the changes made, a demo has been made available as part of Steam Next Fest. Although the Early Access was exclusive to Epic Games Store, the full title will be available on both EGS and Steam when it launches on May 8, 2023.\nThe post Darkest Dungeon II snuffs out the light on May 8th appeared first on Destructoid.",

Benedict isn't alone, however; he's accompanied by a strange, intimidating demon companion, and as he delves deeper into his father's memories, he'll also peer deeper into the abyss.\nIt's easy enough to sum up Benedict Fox by describing it as \"Lovecraft meets Metroidvania,\" but seeing it play out, the blend works. Developer Plot Twist put out a new guided gameplay look today, showing how investigation and mystery are in store for Benedict alongside the action.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKvv--Yc5Yk\nDefeating enemies lets Benedict build up ink, which he can then use to tattoo himself for more power. I dig the way these intersecting systems feed into the darker side of the story. It seems like The Last Case of Benedict Fox might be a good pick-up for those who want some more horror in their Metroidvanias.\nJoining the pass\nBenedict Fox is one of four games highlighted as coming to Xbox Game Pass today over on the Xbox Wire. The other games included are space-sim Everspace 2, side-scrolling narrative adventure Planet of Lana, and co-op mech-farming game Lightyear Frontier.\nIt's a pretty wide array of video game styles, and it's always nice to see a good variety of games headed to the Pass alongside the big Microsoft titles. Even though some big games are going to be swallowing up the oxygen for the foreseeable future, it's nice to get a spotlight on cool and interesting new games like The Last Case of Benedict Fox.\nThe post Lovecraft-vania The Last Case of Benedict Fox arrives in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new plush of Bridget, the yo-yo wielding fighter who made her re-entrance in Guilty Gear Strive not too long ago, is on the way.\nThe Bridget plush specifically highlights her Guilty Gear Strive appearance, down to blue hood and handcuff belt. The plush will go on sale first in Japan, but the Good Smile U.S. shop has pre-orders open. The plush will run $40.99 and is expected to start rolling out for Canada and the U.S. in August 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1622429897695137792\nThe Bridget plush itself is 7.87 inches in height, made of polyester, and is super rad. So if you want to spotlight your main or just have a cute plush of a character you dig, it seems like a solid way to check that box.\nDoll fighter\nBridget has been in the Guilty Gear series for quite a while, but made her return to the modern roster last year in Guilty Gear Strive . A major part of her storyline was coming to terms with her upbringing and identity, eventually affirming her own sense of self. And somehow, Goldlewis Dickinson plays a role in it.\nIt's a heartwarming story, and that popularity ties in well with her yo-yo-flinging arsenal of moves and Strive's absolutely incredible style. So whether you're a new Bridget main or a longtime fan, now you've got a pretty decent merch option to clip onto your bag before the next Evo rolls around.\nGuilty Gear Strive is gearing up for another year of content, with an Xbox launch on the way. A cross-platform beta just took place too, so hopefully this means the online pool will be even larger as the year goes on. It's looking like there's still plenty of Strive on its way.\nThe post Guilty Gear’s Bridget is getting her very own plush from Good Smile appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the title has been on Apple Arcade since 2019, Bleak Sword DX promises to be an “upgraded and definitive” version.\nIf you missed it because you don’t have phone, Bleak Sword is a diorama-style slasher that drops your pixelated self into action setpieces. True to its name, Bleak Sword features dark fantasy rendered in stylized pixel art, giving it an unnerving lo-fi feel. Rather than a cohesive adventure, each level is represented as a battle on a square of land.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/i1t8UzCkBWo[/embed]\nYou can play a Bleak Sword DX demo now\nThe demo is available as part of Steam Next Fest. I fired it up and gave it a playthrough in preparation for writing this. While you can see its retro roots in its rapid-fire pick-up-and-play design, its combat feels more akin to something like Tunic. You watch enemy patterns, roll out of the way, and parry when it feels safe to. The brief levels and simplistic foundation leave a bit to be desired, but it’s definitely not a bad experience at first impression. Notably, the soundtrack is done by Jim Guthrie, which is always a big draw for me.\nBleak Sword DX features a new mode with extra chapters and new level layouts. Beyond that, there are randomizer and boss rush modes. The visuals have also been tweaked to better fit the new platforms it finds itself on. The AI is “enhanced,” and there are additions to the combat system (like the aforementioned parry.)\nBleak Sword is currently available on iOS through Apple arcade. Bleak Sword DX will be available on Switch and PC later in 2023. Currently, you can try out the first chapter in the demo for Steam Next Fest.\nThe post Bleak Sword DX upgrades the bleakness this year on PC and Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The back is adorned with a Triforce symbol, along with a cool little neon effect. Since it's a Switch Lite, the Joy-Con do not detach.\nThe same creator also dabbled in a custom Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Joy-Con mockup (as well as a Switch Dock) if you're interested in these designs.

          "description": "Better luck next year, Extreme Paintbrawl\nTonight is the biggest night and music, and for composer Stephanie Economou, it might be one of the biggest nights of her career. The seasoned musician was one of five people up for a Grammy this year for video game music. This is the first year the category has been a part of the show, and given how instrumental music is to the gaming industry and how easy it is to access your favorite scores on Spotify and Apple Music, one would hope it will be here for many years to come. The award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, which is the award's official name, was handed out in the Grammy's pre-show, going to Economou for her work on the score soundtrack for Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok.\nDawn of Ragnarok is the expansion for AC Valhalla that was released in March of last year to decent reviews. Clearly, the music from the game was more than just decent as Economou managed to take the gramophone over some pretty tough competition. Other nominees including in this inaugural batch were Austin Wintory for Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and Christopher Tin for Old World.\nExpect to see Bear McCreary up for this award again next year with his work on the Game Award-winning score to God of War: Ragnarok. Here's to hoping with this category around, we'll start seeing every video game publisher releasing their scores and soundtracks commercially. I know I would appreciate having the entirety of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 soundtrack at the ready for when I take my walks every day.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok wins inaugural video game Grammy appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nina Willaims, star of Death by Degrees and also a Tekken mainstay, got her first solo trailer for the upcoming release of Tekken 8. Nina, sister of fellow fighter Anna Williams, sports an unforgettable look this time around, and I honestly can't take my eyes off of her. The last Tekken game that I played was Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for the Wii U and she was definitely one of my most played characters. Given her history with the series, I don't think there was ever a danger of Nina not appearing in Tekken 8, but I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long to get her confirmed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3sAt0JbqNs\nThe reveal of Nina Williams for Tekken 8 follows previous trailers for the upcoming fighter that have confirmed other returning favorites. Other fighters set to appear in this highly anticipated sequel include:\nMarshall Law\nPaul Phoenix\nKing\nLars Alexandersson\nJin Kazama\nDevil Jin\nJun Kazama\nKazuya Mishima\nJack-8\nNina's trailer was just one of a few notable pieces of Tekken news today. To ready players for Tekken 8, Executive Director Katsuhiro Harada and Director Kohei Ikeda presented an in-depth look at some of the new systems that'll be introduced in the game, including the new Rage System and a detailed look at the Heat System that was previously announced. The video, posted below, also confirms Tekken 8 will include an optional simplified control scheme that combines the Easy Combo and Assist features from Tekken 7. Bandai Namco also confirmed the Tekken World Tour 2023 would return this year with Tekken 7 and the entire tournament would be fully offline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v47u-_LZOE\nTekken 8 is still without a set release date, but when the game does arrive, you'll be able to pick it up for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Nina Williams comes guns ablazin’ into Tekken 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.",

The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.\nHeroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. \nYou can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Her other credits include Netflix's Jupiter's Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety.

That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012's Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. \nEconomou's Grammy was awarded during the main show's pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game's name last night is any indication. \ncan’t stop laughing at this guy announcing the Grammy win for Assassin's Creed Valhalla pic.twitter.com/vz9bTVZFTX\nFebruary 5, 2023\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our impressions of its Dawn of Ragnarok expansion. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat video game score should win at next year's Grammys show?

          "description": "Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after.

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. \nPlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. \n\n\nIncluding both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. \nPlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.\nIn terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. \nAll told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet. \nDid you pick up a PS5 this holiday season?

In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: \nBatman: Arkham Knight\nBattlefield 1\nBloodborne\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition\nCrash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy\nDays Gone\nDetroit: Become Human\nFallout 4\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition\nGod of War (2018)\nInfamous: Second Son\nThe Last Guardian\nThe Last of Us Remastered\nMonster Hunter: World\nMortal Kombat X\nRatchet & Clank (2016)\nResident Evil VII: Biohazard\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End\nUntil Dawn\nLast year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.",

Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.\" \nAll real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores.

For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit.

Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. \nRumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics.

          "description": "Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.\n“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”\nSupport for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.\n【Important】 Service Termination Announcement\nhttps://t.co/v71WmsKCzE\nJanuary 30, 2023\nCrimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's \"various circumstances\" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.\nIf you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.\nDo you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!",

However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.\nStreet Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.\n\n\n\"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,\" Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. \"We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.\nPre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.",

It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.\nWhile Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. \nUnlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.",

Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support!

          "description": "Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
