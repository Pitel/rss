It wasn't all that surprising given the Big-N's historic protection of its properties and disapproval of unsanctioned emulation, and equally unsurprising is that a new Switch emulator is already stepping up to take Yuzu's place — one that, reportedly, is doing everything in its power to avoid a similar legal fate (thanks, Ars Technica).\nSuyu (pronounced 'sue-you' *wink, wink* according to the emulator's GitLab page) is built from the Yuzu source code and its aim is to continue the work of \"the world's most popular, open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, Yuzu.\" It is not ready for use just yet, though the development team seems hopeful that it will get off the ground.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s a goodbye to a Moomin, so perhaps you’d think it’s not an important goodbye – just a Moomin, after all. But it sets up the main arc of a well-paced and imaginative musical adventure.\nFor the uninitiated – and we’re not exactly experts ourselves here – a Moomin looks like a cross between a snowman and a hippo. They walk upright and talk, and appear to have the ability to cultivate crops and build quite sophisticated houses. The human-like Snufkin has seemingly been accepted into their society and is called upon to assist with their various problems. These problems range from a dry garden to a lost manuscript and everything in between. “What could lie in between a dry garden and a lost manuscript?”, you might ask. Answer: a giant crab to whom Snufkin must play a flute at level 4 inspiration. But more on all that later…\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Off that back of this date announcement, the Big-N also provided a first look at the game's box art and gave a sneak peek at some new screenshots too.\nWe'll start things off by judging a game by its cover. @NintendoEurope gave the following look at TTYD's fresh Switch box art, which sees Mario (with a revolutionary new white outline) take centre stage.

          "description": "Aggressively attacked.\nWith Konami seemingly devoid of both in-house developers and any kind of passion to revive their beloved IPs, WayForward, predominately a licence mule during the '00s, is by far the best option for a new Contra entry. Its work on 2007’s brutally hardcore Contra 4 cemented the developer's prowess, allowing the player to grapple hook between the Nintendo DS’s twin screens. Those who stuck with it discovered a worthy tribute to Konami’s iconic series: a strict memoriser full of magnificent setpieces and high-end destruction worthy of the name.\nIt’s been 16 years too long, and Contra: Operation Galuga has arrived in a markedly different kind of gaming landscape to that of 2007. It’s thanks in part to modern expectations that this new iteration comes with a litany of adjustable content. Where Arcade Mode follows a classic, uncluttered format, Story Mode is filled with cutscenes, in-game communications, and on-screen NPCs that join you sporadically during the action. It isn’t completely necessary and you’ll tire of repeating dialogue interjections as you practice, but, clunky script notwithstanding, it remains a welcome alternative experience. Although Arcade Mode is fat-free and streamlined, and therefore more appealing, we still appreciate having two different ways to tackle the adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sure, perhaps there are some early oddball entries that people missed — games that were crafted when the template and direction of the series was still in flux — but it's hard to argue that these represent the most analysed, most considered and reconsidered video games ever made.\nWhether they're celebrated genre-definers or one of the lesser entries in the Mushroom Kingdom canon, surely every single Mario game is rated absolutely appropriately, right? Sunshine is famously not as polished as other mainline 3D Marios, but it's got some great bits, too.

          "description": "I've written a bit about playing Helldivers 2 as a solo diver, noting that Arrowhead's frenetic shooter holds up surprisingly well when you rudely insist on treating it like an open world stealth sim, a la Metal Gear Solid V. The developers have weighed in on this front, commenting that strictly speaking, Helldivers 2 doesn't support stealth at all. It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very \"arcadey\" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you.

There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody.

Your shopping basket from the Steam store is now shared between devices, so if you put something in there on browser you can finish it up on your Steam Deck. But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!\nRead more",

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After several months on the Steam beta build, Valve last night officially launched an update which revamps the shopping experience and lets you hide your shame. Two universal conveniences: your shopping basket is now shared across devices, so no losing track of things you meant to buy later; and buying gift copies is now less faffy. More conditional: you can now choose to make individual games private, meaning no one will ever see if you own them or are playing them. I won't ask why you might want to hide any particular games.\nRead more",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of the prominent changes with the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver is bringing the GeForce and workstation GPU support up to \"CERTIFIED\" quality when using NVIDIA's open kernel modules that are distributed as part of their driver package. Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products. In this article are some benchmarks of the open and proprietary kernel driver options of the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver.",

At the moment, no matter what quality a fruit tree is, cutting it down will result in only wood and the loss of the tree. To get a new tree, players have to pay a visit to Pierre's shop in order to purchase a new sapling. \n\n\nWell, after 1.6, Pierre’s profits are set to drop because cutting down fruit trees will provide players with a sapling, which can be planted to provide the same fruit. Players are understandably overjoyed at the tidbit of information, with commenters celebrating this as a ‘game changer’, especially at end-game when it comes to redesigning the farm. \n\n\nThere is one caveat to this update, as ConcernedApe details within the comments of his post; saplings that have been obtained through chopping down a tree will grow faster, but the fruit will not be of the same quality immediately, increasing in quality as it always has. \n\n\nPatch 1.6 will go live on March 19, the first day of spring, so we’re not likely to see any more small updates like this before then, but we will of course share the patch notes once they’re available, so watch this space.\n\nThe post ConcernedApe shares a random line from upcoming Stardew Valley 1.6 patch notes, getting players excited for fruit trees appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The hustlin' and bustlin' MultiVersus crew is back with new features on the horizon, as the latest developer update unveils the next step in the action-packed journey. The fighting game has certainly gone through some highs and lows, especially with its open beta shutting down prior. But after a year out of the arena, Multiversus will be released on May 28, 2024. \n\n\nDuring the developer update, Tony Huynh, Game Director and Co-Founder of Player First Games, discussed new characters and maps. In it, he states, \"I'm happy to say we'll be adding some really exciting, brand-new personalities to the roster.\" Fans speculate on who these mysterious characters could be, from Scooby-Doo to the Joker. \n\n\n\n\nMultiversus' visual department improves significantly with Unreal Engine 5, bringing more details to character designs. Compared to its Unreal Engine 4 version, I could definitely see a difference in the brief snippet we got. Wonder Woman's beta form didn't necessarily do her justice previously. But fortunately, the character lighting and shading seem more fitting for Princess Diana now.\n\n\nOther than visuals, Player First Games finely tunes its new netcode to convey more precise movements. More and more fighting games continue to tweak and perfect this framework, as we've seen in Dragon Ball FighterZ and Street Fighter 6. There's nothing worse than executing a punch only for it to be delayed during a hectic online showdown. So, it's pleasing to see another brawler get another fresh update for those nice and smooth movements. \n\n\nAlthough Multiversus primarily showcases a competitive PvP, a new PvE has entered the battlefield. What this entails is unknown, yet we know it will introduce unique challenges and rewards. In the coming weeks, more information will be disclosed to give us the lowdown on its launch, all to gear up for its May release. \n\nThe post MultiVersus returns with new characters and PvE mode, set for May appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Incube8 Games has announced that they’re going to be the ones to stamping AgeOfGames unreleased Game Boy Advance game, Kien, to cartridge this year. It will be released in Q2 2024 on GBA.\n\n\nKien was originally set to launch during the GBA’s heyday in 2002. As the story goes, the game made it as far as being sent to review publications at the time, only to be canceled before release. It got picked up and canceled again by other publishers but was never released. However, a prototype ROM did get leaked and made its rounds.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a mix of action-platformer and RPG. The story involves two apprentices fighting evil in the wake of the disappearance of the 7 Masters of the Absolute.\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is that Kien is maybe not great. Nintendo Power was among the publications at the time that reviewed it (issue 173, November 2003), and the five staff members who looked at it gave it an average of three out of five stars. That makes it slightly better than Power Rangers: Ninja Rescue by their sizing of it, but not as good as Ultimate Beach Soccer. Nintendo Power reviews were weird at that time.\n\n\nIn any case, the Incube8 release will come with a cartridge, protector, box, manual, and stickers. It's great to see a game that never got a chance back in the day being given some life, and I've been enjoying the age of retro reproductions we're currently living in.\n\n\nKien will be available for GBA sometime in the second quarter of 2024. Though, it would show real commitment if they canceled it at the last minute.\n\nThe post Thrice-canceled GBA game Kien is finally getting released 22 years after completion appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last week saw the exciting new trailer for the upcoming Fallout show. While the adaptation is going to be telling its own story, you may be wondering whether it might touch on Fallout 5's possible narrative, even accidentally. However, Todd Howard has made sure that hasn't happened.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Den of Geek (as spotted by VGC), the show's executive producer Jonathan Nolan clarified whether the TV series is, to some extent, Fallout 5. Nolan says a conversation between him and Todd discussed the idea of the show being a part of the overall Fallout universe, rather than being a retelling of one of the game's stories.\n\n\n\n\nTodd Howard then said he made sure the showrunners didn't do certain things. He said he told the crew, \"don't do this, because we're going to do that in Fallout 5.\" There's even a joke about how the adaptation is almost like Fallout 6. But the consensus is that the show is its own story and doesn't tread on anything that's come before or after it in terms of arc.\n\n\nSpeaking of Fallout 5...\n\n\nWhen Bethesda confirmed the next Fallout game was currently being worked on, I think it's safe to assume people thought it was too early to make such an announcement. Starfield was still very much in development at the time, and we still have absolutely no idea what's going on with The Elder Scrolls 6 since that 2018 E3 tease.\n\n\nIn short: don't expect Todd to start giving away too much about F5 or TES6 anytime soon. I think he's still coasting on the (ahem) success of Starfield, but hopefully, the studio is making some headway on the new projects.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Fallout will be airing on April 11 via Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe post Todd Howard made sure the Fallout TV series didn’t include Fallout 5 ideas appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.\nWhat's more, Korol says the game will feature \"a rich Offline Mode\" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.\n\n\nKorol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. \n\"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal,\" Korol writes. \"Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign.\" \n\n\nGame Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast.

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus?

The games join the Game Boy library, which is included with the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 a year).\nDr. Mario from Game Boy, Mario Golf from Game Boy Color, and Mario Tennis from Game Boy Color join the Switch Online Game Boy catalog. The collection already includes the likes of Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, Kirby's Dream Land 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, Tetris, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons, and Metroid II – Return of Samus. Oddly enough, the library is missing all of the Pokémon titles, as well as the original Super Mario Land.\nDr. Mario, Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis arrive on the service this Tuesday, March 12.",

However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.\nWhen it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.\n\n\nLuigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch.

          "description": "Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?",

However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. \nThe first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game.

He was 68.\nThe news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.\nGame Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.",

Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.\nAs Penny, a street performer…",

          "description": "Fortnite: Chapter 5 was a huge launch for the long-running battle royale developed by Epic Games. Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.\nAs Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. \nPrepare thyselves, mere mortals!\npic.twitter.com/0d91p34hCu\nMarch 7, 2024\nUnfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.\nOnly time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. \nIn the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month.

          "description": "Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new \"Cutting Edge\" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with \"high-voltage vibes,\" giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. \nWarbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new \"Acquisitions\" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. \nCheck out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWithin this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with \"wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.\" The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the \"end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'\"\nIn terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. \nYou can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. \n\nElsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. \nCutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war. \nAre you excited for Warbond – Cutting Edge in Helldivers 2?

And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. \nThe trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: \n\n\n\"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have,\" a press release reads. \"200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.\" \nAmazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. \nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. \nFor more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December.

          "description": "The Alters is a fascinating new sci-fi survival game from 11 Bit Studios, makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine. First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by \"himself,\" I mean multiple versions of himself.\nJan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the \"what if\" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. \n\n\nThe Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today's Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it's coming to Game Pass for console and PC.",

The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. \nIn terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. \n\n\nDeveloper Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.\nPer the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” \nGhost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. \nGhost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.",

          "description": "In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nThe 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.\nPlayers take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For more info on the other big TMNT video game in development, The Last Ronin, head here for our exclusive interview with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman.",

You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. \nThat's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.\n\n\nAs you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. \nIt's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series.

You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.\nI had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",

Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.",

Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating.

Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.",
