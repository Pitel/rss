          "description": "There's always room for one more good one.\nIn 2019, a small French studio called Hibernian Workshop released a game called Dark Devotion, a promising 2D soulslike that was met with mixed reviews, but managed to garner a passionate fanbase. A couple of years later, the team returned with a Kickstarter pitch for a new roguelite called Astral Ascent, which hit its funding goal within two days and managed to blow past it considerably in the weeks to come. Since then, the crew has been busily working away at it while sharing periodic updates, and the day has now come that Astral Ascent is seeing its full release. We’re happy to report that this is a tremendous new entry in the Switch’s packed roguelite library, quickly inserting itself amongst the very best.\nAstral Ascent is set in a modern fantasy land called the Garden, which is a lush and beautiful prison guarded by 12 godlike jailers, each based on a Zodiac symbol. You play as one of the prisoners in this magical place, trying your absolute hardest to break out and secure freedom for both you and your allies. Each of the Zodiacs has a unique personality and clearly knows their prisoners personally, and as you engage in your endless attempts to escape, more of the backstory is slowly revealed that highlights the connections between these characters and why they find themselves locked in this seemingly eternal loop.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "As refreshing as a river in a dry land.\nNever let it be said that Atlus is one to let its star franchises go untapped. It’s now been seven years since the Phantom Thieves were first introduced in Persona 5, and since then we’ve gotten an enhanced re-release of that game, a dungeon crawler, a rhythm game, a musou, an anime, a manga, and several crossovers with other franchises, such as Joker making an appearance as a fighter in Super Smash Bros. While we continue to wait for the inevitable unveiling of Persona 6, Atlus has decided to keep the spinoff train rolling right along with Persona 5 Tactica, a tactical RPG featuring the beloved cast in yet another new adventure. We’re happy to report that Persona 5 Tactica doesn’t feel like a half-hearted attempt to cash in on the Phantom Thieves once again — this is an engaging strategy game with plenty of cool ideas and fun moments.\nPersona 5 Tactica picks up during the events of Persona 5, when the Phantom Thieves are hanging out in Café Leblanc and find themselves suddenly pulled into an alternate universe that might or might not be the Metaverse. Our daring heroes’ powers don’t work quite the same here, and they soon find themselves accosted by a crazed, powerful bride named Marie who commands a legion of Shadows. Marie rules over her domain with an iron fist, and she easily crushes the Phantom Thieves, kidnapping and brainwashing all but Joker and Morgana. These latter two are just about to be subdued themselves when they’re saved by Erina, a mysterious girl who leads a small resistance effort that Marie is hellbent on stamping out. The two thus team up with her and set out to reclaim their friends, hoping to defeat Marie and escape from this strange world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The Persona 5 kids are trapped in high school, their semesters stretched into infinity by the inescapable march of spin-offs that have been retroactively stuffed into every available blank spot. Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. \r\n\n\r\nYour energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic. Then again, if you're a Persona fan, it's still more than a good excuse to sink back into another adventure with your pals.  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Making a strategy game is \"harder than people give it credit for,\" Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it \"late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles,\" but it's also \"suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have,\" he says. \nEven now, \"it's got some catching up to do,\" he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that \"there's a thirst for something different now,\" both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. \"We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.' That's the goal.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. \r\n\nThe gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.\r\n\n\r\nThe reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase \"due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks\". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.\r\n\n\r\nI have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's \"just for kids\". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.\r\n \nRead more",

Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. \"They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. \r\n\n\r\n\"They had no shame!\" Aureus goes on. \"Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all.\"  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. \"So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.\nZelnick cautioned one investor against \"generalising\" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.\nHere's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.\nRead more",

          "description": "As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been \"demade\" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. \nCrow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?\nRead more",

There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Valve love their surprise hardware announcements, and there’s just been a doozy in the Steam Deck OLED. It’s a \"definitive\" refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.\nRead more",

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.\nRead more",

Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

          "description": "When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since it's starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won't be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.\nIn the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you're a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.\nRead more",

          "description": "Zdá se, že říjen je okurkovou sezónou bastlířů - akcí ubývá, nikomu se nechce ven, zajímavých věcí je také pomálu, ale i tak je o čem si ve společnosti se strahovskými bastlíři povídat. Právě probíhají snahy o reverzní inženýrství nad koprocesorem RP1 od Raspberry Foundation, protože dokumentace ještě nebyla uvolněna. Zároveň HackADay vydal novou analogovou badge a vyhlásil soutěž, a také vznikl nový zajímavý demoboard s 2x RP2040. Zároveň byly uvedeny nové tiskárny z dílen Prusa Research. Strahováci také byli na OpenAltu, kde měli několik přednášek a můžou vám z nich ukázat pár zajímavostí. Věděli jste, že jde vyrábět plnobarevné plošné spoje? Ano, už se nemusíte omezovat na jednu barvu, brzy bude dostupná plnobarevná výroba. Také bude k vidění náhrada za drahý systém Tag-Connect nebo ryze český cín SN100C. Chcete vědět, jak jednoduše se dá napadnout iPhone Flipperem nebo jak se hackuje šifrovaná flashka? Pak se vám určitě budou líbit softwarově orientovaná témata. Samozřejmě si bastlíři ani tentokrát neodpustí poněkud bizarnější témata, třeba na co nepoužívat rentgen, co dokáže Arduino ve velmi nesprávných rukou nebo kde všude se dá najít NodeRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 15. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Naughty Dog has been pretty quiet on the gaming front this year, though the HBO series continues to be popular. According to Production List, filming for season 2 is scheduled to begin on January 7 next year. \n\n\nLike the prior one, season 2 will be filmed in Canada. Production List has Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann returning as producers and writers. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey also return, presumably reprising their roles as Joel and Ellie respectively.\n\n\nImage via HBO.\n\n\nWhat to expect from season 2 of The Last of Us\n\n\nThe upcoming season will be split into two parts. This makes sense for anyone familiar with The Last of Us Part 2. In a prior interview with Deadline, Mazin also discusses how the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes affected work. When it struck, they were in the middle of scriptwriting, but that had to be put on hold. \n\n\nThey had gotten pretty far already, and Mazin was able to \"write and submit the first episode right before the deadline hit.\" According to Mazin, the next season of The Last of Us is scheduled to air in 2025, though nothing is certain yet. Despite the setback, he still really wants \"to try and get this show on the air when it’s supposed to be on the air.\" \n\n\nMazin also gives hope that the series won't end with the second season. There are already ideas being tossed around, and he is adamant that the \"show will not end with Season 2 unless people don’t watch it and we’ll get canceled.\" \n\n\n\n\nMany franchise fans have also been waiting for the multiplayer counterpart of The Last of Us Part 2 to launch. For a while, it seemed like the project had been scrapped but Naughty Dog game director Vinit Agarwal has confirmed he's still working on it.\n\nThe post Filming for The Last of Us season 2 begins early 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Don't forget to get to the bottom of Mayor Setter's campaign, as it comes with a surprising revelation. Alan Wake 2 spoilers are below. \n\n\nAs you explore Bright Falls, you'll likely notice all of Mayor Setter's ad campaign. The ads are eye-catching, especially because despite the passionate campaign, it doesn't seem like Mayor Setter has much competition. The game does give you hints along the way regarding who the mayor is, though it's easy to not piece the story together if you're not paying enough attention.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nMeeting Mayor Setter\n\n\nThere are six Mayor Setter ads scattered throughout Bright Falls and Watery. You'll find them on the parts of the map marked below. \n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\n\nBy Return 6: Scratch, you will have access to all the ads, but don't go any further, or else you'll be locked out of full exploration. Find them all then head into Saga Anderson's Mind Place where you'll find a poster depicting the cutest dog. Go to Suomi Hall, and you'll discover the dog on stage, waiting to be petted. That's Mayor Setter! \n\n\nIt's worth petting the dog, as you'll earn the Nice Things in Life achievement, and you'll score a charm that allows you to see all collectibles on the map. This is very useful to have if you're aiming to 100% complete the game. \n\n\n\n\nMayor Setter has become quite popular among Alan Wake fans on Twitter and Reddit, indicating that the pup politician has a good shot at winning debates without barking a word. Petting Mayor Setter is also a nice break from the more morbid petting Saga does when she encounters taxidermy deer heads. \n\nThe post Don’t forget to visit Mayor Setter in Alan Wake 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Perhaps the biggest highlight of Remnant 2 was its incredible world-building and design. All three core worlds—Losomn, N'Erud, and Yaesha—were so distinct and immersive that they very well could have been their own games. In the first Remnant 2 DLC, players revisit Losomn in an attempt to track down the One True King.\n\n\nThe new Forlorn Coast adds another variant to Losomn, making it one of the zone's three roll possibilities. The mad king thinks everyone has betrayed him, and teleports his castle smack dab in a Dran coastal town. After my roughly seven-hour journey through the new area, I was pleased with the content the DLC added to Remnant 2. To put it simply, this is just more Remnant 2, and that's not a bad thing.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nRemnant 2: The Awakened King DLC (PC [revi…",

The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley has orchestrated an in-game opportunity in which players can now vote on the battle royale title's best user-created island of the year.\n\n\nThe announcement came from Keighley this afternoon. In collaboration with Nighttimes and Studio 568, the partnership has created a hub world that Fortnite players can travel to to vote in-game on what they believe is the best original locale out there.\n\n\n\n\nThe in-game experience is something The Game Awards creator, Geoff Keighley, has been excited about for years:\n\n\n\"Ever since I hosted Live From Risky Reels in Fortnite in 2019, I’ve been thinking about ways The Game Awards could bring our celebration inside the games we play every day,\" said Keighley in a press release. \"Our Fortnite island is the first experiment in this direction, and I’m particularly excited to help shine the spotlight on the amazing user-generated community around the world.\"\n\n\nThe Game Awards Island, located in-game at 0853-1358-8532, features 10 creator-made islands that can be voted on once a day per Epic ID. After players finish voting, they can explore the custom island to find Game Awards statues scattered throughout. If all of the statues are found, players will enjoy a nice XP boost for their efforts. \n\n\nThe Game Awards Vote in Fortnite event begins today and runs until December 6 at 6:00 p.m. PT. The winning island will be revealed the following night, December 7, during The Game Awards live and within The Game Awards Fortnite island.

What might be coming after it?

Steam Deck OLED was necessary. We feel like there's a road map ahead of us.\" Indeed, the OLED version of the device might effectively target the very same performance envelope as the baseline, but it does deliver some key wins with a bigger battery, a hugely improved display, and other quality-of-life boons.

          "description": "Netmarble is working on an open-world action game based on The Seven Deadly Sins manga and anime, and it looks pretty ambitious if the latest trailer is any indication.\n\n\nThe new preview made its way online just ahead of the 2023 G-Star event, which will be held in Busan, South Korea, from November 16 to 19. As pointed out by Gematsu, Netmarble got in on the showcase with a video highlighting some of the Unreal Engine 5-powered combat and exploration. See how the world of Britannia looks in The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nApocalypse Soon\n\n\nBased on the manga by Nakaba Suzuki, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin features a bunch of characters from both that and sequel series Four Knights of the Apocalypse. Tristan Liones, the son of original leads Melodias and Elizabeth, serves as the main protagonist. The visuals accompanying the game's open-world trappings look straight out of the anime adaptation, which includes multiple seasons and films. \n\n\nThis isn't the first journey into Britannia for the developers. Netmarble previously worked on mobile and PC outing The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross, billed as a \"cinematic anime game.\" I didn't personally play enough of that one to say for sure if it has a mine cart section or not. Origin, on the other hand, definitely has a mine cart section according to the new trailer. In a perfect world, it'll at least be better than 2018's dismal Knights of Britannia. \n\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins: Origin currently has its sights on consoles, PC, and mobile. There's no release date in place at the time of this writing, but hopefully we'll find out when to expect it soon. \n\nThe post The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin trailer shows off open-world anime action appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s a 2D, side-scrolling action game set in an abandoned neon cyberpunk city, and I am totally here for it.\n\n\nIn the announcement trailer, we’re shown a bit of the combat against monsters like a horde of giant frogs, mechanical dragons, and what seems to be a demonic sumo wrestler. But, what I think is the coolest part is that the main character’s sword has the ability to create structures to help them get around tricky obstacles. In the trailer, for example, we can see the sword manifest a bridge to help them cross from one area to another, and later we see the sword create an escalator to help them progress.\n\n\n\n\nIt also looks like the sword can be used for more practical uses during battle. In the trailer, we see the sword trapping one of the giant frogs in its radius and inflicting constant damage for a couple of seconds, and later we see it creating cover that blocks a particularly threatening bird enemy’s beam attack.\n\n\nBlade Chimera is set for release in the Spring of 2024, and it’ll be available on the Nintendo Switch. If more information, including other platforms or a more specific date are made known, we’ll be sure to update this page accordingly.\n\nThe post Blade Chimera is a futuristic ‘Vania that I’m totally here for appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While we still wait for confirmation on Nvidia's alleged RTX 4080 SUPER, Team Green's most powerful graphics card continues to have overheating problems. In fact, one repairman has experienced such an influx of broken GPUs they've had to take their health into consideration.\n\n\nAs spotted by Tom's Hardware, repair shop Northridge Fix has said it's been receiving between 20 and 25 Nvidia RTX 4090s a week. All of which need fixing due to melted power connectors.\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent YouTube analysis video, a repairman for the company has said that he's had to purchase a face mask so he doesn't have to keep \"smelling the burn on those connectors,\" referring to the ones on the broken graphics cards.\n\n\nThe smell is \"unbearable\"\n\n\nHealth risks aside, this influx of GPUs being sent to Northridge Fix is part of an ongoing problem with Nvidia's piece of enthusiast hardware. The RTX 4090s have been known to have overheating issues since day one, but concerns have been largely dismissed as being down to \"user error.\"\n\n\nThe footage also shows the amount of 4090 cards that have been sent to the repair shop. More than 10 have been fixed recently, with the repairman concluding that the \"melted connector is not a user problem.\"\n\n\nThe fact that the RTX 4090 has a TDP of 450W could be part of what's causing them to overheat. Compare that to the RTX 4080 with a TDP of 320W (according to TechPowerup), and it's easy to point a finger at the culprit.\n\n\nThe Ada Lovelace range has been out for over a year now. At the time of writing, Nvidia doesn't appear to have made significant steps towards addressing the issues with the 4090. It's possible more cases will come to light.\n\nThe post The number of Nvidia RTX 4090s needing repairs highlights an ongoing issue appeared first on Destructoid.",

Rather than just be a series of similar challenges, the musical tracks are set alongside a variety of different situations and utilized for different means.\n\n\nNot only that, but you can team up with other humans for four-player co-op so you can suffer from your friends and family’s complete lack of rhythm. I often play Rock Band with my family, and it’s best if I just focus on what I’m doing while they hack away at easy mode. Speaking of which, you can fine-tune your difficulty.\n\n\n\n\nYou may have been excited by Konami’s inclusion as the publisher. The Konami name still evokes thoughts of Goemon and Castlevania in my head. But while no classic characters are shown off in the trailers, someone does pick up a Famicom-looking Holy Cartridge that announces it contains Vampire Killer from Castlevania. Aw, heck yes.\n\n\nIt’s actually an entertaining-looking little title. I had planned on checking out the demo during the recent Steam Next Fest but didn’t get around to it. But maybe I will.

One standout is Inkle's A Highland Song which attempts to capture the feeling of exploring the wild and wide Scottish mountains. \n\n\nAccording to creative director Joseph Humphrey and lead level designer Nat Clayton, their own experiences adventuring through nature influenced the game. As they explain, the Scotlands wilderness is exceptionally beautiful, but it is also a dangerous place that can take you by surprise if you aren't prepared. \n\n\nInkle has tried to capture this in A Highland Song which features both tranquil and treacherous landscapes. You'll have to tackle difficult climbs and fast-paced rhythm runs to survive the often unforgiving outdoors. It features an art style too adorable to not fall in love with, and the trailer reveals that you'll be treated to several breathtaking scenes of the natural environment. \n\n\nImage via Inkle.\n\n\nHow you explore your environment will dictate how the story plays out. We don't know much about the story yet, except that the heroine is on a quest to go to the sea by Beltane. As you unravel the tale, you'll be serenaded with relaxing Scottish folk music to ensure your journey is unforgettable.  \n\n\nThe game launches on December 5 this year, and pre-orders begin today. If you're looking for something relaxing yet captivating, A Highland Song seems like it might be worth a peek. \n\nThe post Explore the mountains of Scotland with A Highland Song appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Humble Games and Memorable Games have announced their investigative life sim, On Your Tail, for a 2024 release window.\n\n\nI like life sims and being made to feel smart for completing simple tasks. On Your Tail has you step into the hooves of Diana, an \"intrepid young detective,\" as she tries to unravel a mystery set within a seaside town. I guess the mystery isn't too pressing, though, since you can also spend time on the beach, make friends, and go fishing. Crime can wait; it's time to relax.\n\n\n\n\nThe detective game genre is getting a little crowded these days, but I can't help but get excited by the dioramas. You collect clues by investigating, which take the form of cards that you play in a diorama sub-game. It looks cute. Who doesn't love a good diorama?\n\n\nAs an added bonus, in the Indie World Direct, Andrea, the game's executive producer, wears an incredible shirt. It is, as Destructoid's own Eric \"Lightspeed\" Van Allen refers to it, \"Indie World Dip.\"\n\n\nOn Your Tail is set to release in 2024. The Direct only mentions a Switch release, but there's a Steam store page up for it, so it's at least coming to PC, as well.\n\nThe post On Your Tail is an investigative life sim with dioramas appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last July, I reported that the once-lost GBA game Shantae Advance would launch on the Game Boy Advance in 2024. While this was a neat revival, many at the time wondered if we might also see this title on platforms that aren't more than a decade old. Thankfully, we have an answer now.\n\n\nAnnounced during today's Indie World Showcase, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution will also launch on Nintendo Switch next year. Based on the footage shown, it appears to be a mostly faithful port of the upcoming GBA title. This even extends to the multiplayer Battle Mode, which players can play locally in this version. That said, the character portraits do flex the better-than-GBA resolution, more closely resembling what we saw in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the presentation, developer WayForward went on to clarify that Shantae Advance will also appear on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Additionally, we got confirmation that those character portraits will still be in the Gameboy Advance version of the game, just not in HD like the trailer shows.\n\n\nWe still don't know exactly when Shantae Advance will arrive in 2024. But we'll certainly keep our eyes peeled as we learn more about these unearthed games.\n\nThe post Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution launches on modern consoles in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Given the hype surrounding it prior to release, pretty much everyone expected Starfield to be a rousing success. However, most probably expected (hoped, even) it would have a healthy amount of staying power. But as recent stats show, Bethesda's newest IP is experiencing a drop in popularity.\n\n\nAccording to the data on SteamDB (as spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun), Starfield has fewer people playing the game right now than Skyrim. At the time of writing, the former is just shy of 14,000 concurrent players, while the latter has nearly 16,000 for the Special Edition alone.\n\n\nAdd onto that the 1,796 fans playing just regular Skyrim and we get a picture of just how much more engaging Bethesda's 2011 epic RPG is.\n\n\nIt's a tall order to beat Skyrim\n\n\nOf course, given TES5's legacy – and having just celebrated 12 years – it's a tough act to follow, even from the game's own developer. Starfield launched to significant feedback, most of which was pretty glowing, but interest is definitely waning now.\n\n\nMaybe this is a question of overhype. Often, video games struggle to match the expectations that people have, and some of the time, it's the fault of the developer for pushing a product too hard (hello, No Man's Sky).\n\n\nThat's not to say Starfield is a bad game. It's been nominated for Best RPG at this year's The Game Awards, so it's not exactly without merit or kudos. There's just something about the fact that one of the most anticipated releases of this generation is seemingly losing its audience. And it's only been out a couple of months.\n\nThe post Starfield is now less popular than Skyrim in terms of concurrent players appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While the original Alone in the Dark arguably set the scene for modern survival horror, Resident Evil is the one most think of when it comes to the genre. Capcom's legendary series has endured and while official remakes have been hitting the ground running, fan projects have also been attempting to leave their mark.\n\n\nTeam Arklay has recently uploaded a trailer for its unofficial remake of the first Resident Evil entry. Simply called Biohazard RE1, the upcoming game is being made in Unreal Engine 5, and from what we can see in the footage, it looks pretty impressive.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it's fair to say it's not exactly sporting photorealistic visuals, the post-cutscene moments definitely breathe new life into the OG RE. It should also be noted that this trailer is representative of work that's currently in progress. As such, we can expect things to look even better further down the line.\n\n\nA mix of old and new\n\n\nWhat's interesting about this fan remake is it seems to aim for the graphics of a more modern Resident Evil installment without compromising on some of that old horror movie cheese. The series has notably become a bit more serious and gritty over the years, so it's nice to see Team Arklay keeping some of that goofiness.\n\n\nBiohazard RE1 is still in development, with no projected release window yet. However, we know the game will give you the option to choose between the over-the-shoulder camera or go old school with a fixed camera perspective. Again, it seems to be going for a mix between classic and modern RE.\n\n\nThe future of Resident Evil is looking pretty good at the moment. Brand-new entries and official remakes have kept Capcom's franchise fresh and exciting. There was a period in which the RE name was starting to lose focus. However, with the way things are going, a ninth mainline game is something fans will be looking forward to.\n\nThe post Here’s the trailer for the upcoming UE5 fan remake of Resident Evil appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I was really hoping for a relaxing game. I needed one. Spirittea was promising that experience. Unfortunately, it’s a clear demonstration that there’s a fine line between relaxation and boredom.\n\n\nMashing up my favorite Spirited Away and Stardew Valley and featuring my favorite pastimes of taking baths and drinking tea, it had everything going for it. Heck, the protagonist is a writer who travels to the countryside to work on their latest book. I'm a writer. At least, I sometimes claim to be.\n\n\nBut after nearly 20 hours, I was a season and a half into the game. I’d befriended a handful of spirits and villagers. The bathhouse was coming along. But it was crawling. Forget relaxing; going back to Spirittea was beginning to just add to my misery. Something went wrong here.\n\n\nScreenshot by Dest…",

Thank you for giving me a megaphone to cry for help. Hopefully, someone will hear my pleas.\n\n\nI’ve been fighting a losing battle to try and get Extreme Paintbrawl working on a modern PC. That game has the reputation of being the absolute worst game ever built in Ken Silverman’s wonderful Build Engine. While the engine was home to games like Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood, it also had a lot more questionable games. Last week, I covered 1998's Nam.

          "description": "Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness.

That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well.

After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. \nThe roadmap also includes a \"regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience.\" \n\n\nStopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says \"players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community.\" \n\"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community,\" studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. \"We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries.\"\nFor more, read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review and then listen to us talk about it on The Game Informer Show. \nHave you played Lords of the Fallen?

It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. \nThis news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold.

That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
