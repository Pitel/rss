Let's not beat about the bush here: it's a Switch (thanks for the heads up, Notebookcheck).\nAccording to the Sjgam website, the M20 Pro boasts a seven-inch display (1024 x 600 pixels), runs on the Linux-based EmuELEC 4.3 operating system to support over 30 emulators and comes with a dock for TV output. Notebookcheck claims that while the handheld's Rockchip RK3566 CPU and Mali-G52 GPU make for a decent budget combination, the pairing may struggle with more intense emulators like PSP and N64 — sorry, Banjo.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder strategy remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research.

          "description": "Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

          "description": "Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 devs. As hinted at a couple of times over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.\nUnsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.\nRead more",

          "description": "The \"spance\" of Annihilate The Spance is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire.

The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling.

You're on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he'll take your own lord's side in the on-going civil war.

Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.\nThe problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.\nRead more",

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.\nIt really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

Thankfully, we already have information about how to get them inside the game, which will help you to be on top when the event goes live soon.\n\n\nHow to get the Adopt Me Lunary New Year Event 2025 Snakes\n\n\nThere will be four snakes, one of which will be of Legendary rarity. Apart from that, you'll be able to obtain a new snake every week, and you can get all four by the time the event ends. You'll have to get an event currency called Shooting Stars to find a snake.\n\n\nBased on YouTube Cookie Cutter, we can get Shooting Stars daily. They can be collected from the ground, and you can use them in the Lunar Vending Machine. You can always get more Shooting Stars with the help of microtransactions if you don't mind spending on Robux. I believe there will be more items in the Vending Machine, and getting a snake will boil down to your luck (this is my assumption, not verified information). \n\n\nThanks to Cookie Cutter, we know that the first two snakes will be called Gilded Snake and Blossom Snake. Make sure to check out this weekly dev blog from Jessie to learn more about how to get all the snakes during the upcoming event.\n\n\n\n\nIt will be interesting to learn more about the events' other parts. We will update any additional farming methods for Shooting Stars if they exist during the event. Additionally, it will be interesting to get more details about the Legendary snake and how to obtain it in Adopt Me.\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year event will be available for four weeks, starting from January 24. While the three snakes will each be available for a week, the Legendary snake will be available during all four weeks. Make sure to get all of them before the event ends in February. \n\nThe post Adopt Me: How to get all snakes in Lunar New Year event 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Without further delay, let's take a look at how you can find all the circuits in the Defense Tech event.\n\n\nHow to find the Circuits in Toilet Tower Defense Tech event\n\n\nAll nine Circuit boards are located around the Tech City event world. Thankfully, they're pretty easy to spot despite them having different locations. You'll be looking for bright green boards at various spots. Of course, you might have encountered some of them as they're not exactly hidden. If you're yet to complete the collection, here are the locations of all nine boards.\n\n\n\nThe first three boards are located inside the play area. The first of the three is at the enemy spawn portal, while the second will be at the center of the arena. The third one is slightly hidden behind a rock formation.\n\n\nThe fourth one is right behind the portal, which lets you access the Toilet Fortress.\n\n\nThe fifth one can be found behind the Ranked mode board, near the Apocalypse city map.\n\n\nTo get the sixth board, go to the Summon Unit area. You'll find the board next to a wooden block.\n\n\nThe seventh one can be collected from the Trading Plaza. Go to the archway on the left, and you'll find the board next to a pillar.\n\n\nThe eighth one is also located at the Trading Plaza, adjacent to a wooden statue at the far end of the location.\n\n\nThe final one will require you to visit a statue in the water at Trading Plaza. The Circuit board will be located at the top of the statue.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollecting all nine Circuit boards in the Defense Tech event will help you get 1,000 XP and 500 Batteries.\n\nThe post Toilet Tower Defense: All 9 Defense Tech circuit locations appeared first on Destructoid.",

Along with the announcement is a new trailer, as well as the estimated release date of June, 2025.\n\n\nThe Kickstarter is intended to raise funds to finish the last stretch of development, as it seems Mashina is well on the way, judging by the trailer. The campaign is aiming to raise £12000. The game was announced with a teaser this past December, but the Kickstarter and gameplay trailer paint a much clearer picture.\n\n\n\n\nYou play as the titular character who has a penchant for digging. They’re stranded on an island with a handful of locals that you’ll get intimately familiar with. Digging allows you to gather resources, as well as things to decorate the island and gift to the other characters. Beyond just directly getting your hands dirty, you can also construct machines to help with your work. Looks cozy.\n\n\nLike Judero, all of the assets in Machina are hand-sculpted. Apparently, if you pledge £500, you’ll get one of the handmade robots. I had the chance to interview one of the developers, Jack King-Spooner, for the Destructoid Changelog Newsletter’s monthly special this month. He tells me that clay getting stuck under fingernails. As to what his strategy is. “To prevent under-nail clay I use a collection of ornate porcelain thimbles.” Incredible. I only ask the tough questions.\n\n\nI also reviewed Judero back in September. It’s fantastic. I don’t exactly get it, but I can dig those vibes. There’s nothing out there quite like it, and it’s something you have to experience. I think I can grok Mashina a little better, barring any massive curveballs that might be thrown.\n\n\nThe Kickstarter for Mashina starts tomorrow, January 22, 2025. It’s release is planned for PC sometimes in June 2025.\n\nThe post Judero developer’s handcrafted follow-up, Mashina, digs into Kickstarter tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Anime Vanguards 3.0 update went live earlier during the weekend, and it has introduced something called Gift Boxes and Presents.\n\n\nThese items can be obtained by grinding missions inside the game. However, you can take steps to increase your chances of success and the rate you get the Gift Boxes in Anime Vanguards.\n\n\nHow to get Gift Boxes and Presents in Anime Vanguards\n\n\nTo begin the process, you'll want to open a Winter Portal (can be purchased with Gems). While you can earn Gift Boxes from different ones, go for the ones that take place on Planet Namak. This is the easiest way to obtain Presents, and dealing with the enemies will be easier. This is applicable irrespective of the tier of your stage.\n\n\nThe next step is to complete the Winter Portal, which will guarantee another portal (if you successfully manage to clear it). These portals begin from Tier 1 and go all the way up to Tier 10. If you clear a Tier 10 Portal, you'll only get a Tier 9/Tier 10 Portal in return. Hence, the event gets better the more you play the game.\n\n\nExclusive units are also recommended, as they have better in-game stats and abilities, making it easier for you to end the enemies. This is more important if you're trying to clear the high-tier portals.\n\n\nDo note that a Gift Box isn't guaranteed even if you manage to complete a portal. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use Presents in Anime Vanguards\n\n\nThere are two main ways to use Presents that you get. The Presents are a separate currency used at the Event NPC to get different items (located in the Quest area). However, a better use for this currency is to use it on the Winter Event limited banner. Some fantastic characters are present on this banner, and the only way to open this is by using the Gift Boxes.\n\n\nHence, it's the best time to get grinding in Anime Vanguards and earn as many Gift Boxes and Presents as possible.\n\nThe post What do Gift Boxes and Presents do and how to get them in Anime Vanguards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thankfully, it's fairly easy to make by finding Vitalys Crystals and more from the game. \n\n\nMiracle Growth Elixir Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo create the awesome Miracle Growth Elixir in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n\n\n10 Vitalys Crystals\n\n\n10 Rich Soil\n\n\n500 Dreamlight\n\n\n\nVitalys Crystals are found within a cave around the Sunlit Plateau called the Vitalys Mine. Look for the waterfall near a stone bridge to find it. You'll first want a companion with you, who has the Mining specialty, so the process becomes faster. Mine at the rocks that have a blue streak to them. Hit them with the pickaxe, and you have a good chance to get a Vitalys Crystal. Having a companion with you gives a chance of getting another Vitalys Crystal. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nRich Soil is gained by digging up the soil at any location, especially within the Plaza. This is a random drop. Having a digging specialty companion with you may help with the process too. \n\n\nDreamlight is gathered by completing quests and finishing Duties like taking a picture or collecting enough apples. You can check your objectives on the menu. It's under the first section \"Dreamlight.\" You can also craft Dreamlight with Dream Shards.\n\n\nHow to use this elixir\n\n\nOnce you have all of the ingredients, go to any crafting station near your house or in Scrooge's store. You can find the Miracle Growth Elixir from the list of options. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMake sure to pick the correct potion. Once it's made, use it from your inventory menu. Then, equip the water can. Spray it on the crops you want to see grow instantly. You only have a few limited uses so pick your crops wisely. \n\nThe post How to make Miracle Growth Elixir in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

          "description": "Z \"Párty Hárd\" jsem byl nadšen, ale tohle jako kdyby natočil (a především napsal) někdo úplně jiný. Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen \"věci na jistotu\" jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)",

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
