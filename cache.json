But the rumour mill is running, and it's pointing towards a brand new Castlevania game.\nYesterday, Chinese-based journalist and GamesIndustry.biz contributor Daniel Camilo has heard from \"reliable sources\" that a brand new \"AAA\" Castlevania game will be revealed this year (along with a few other notable series). And Portuguese website GeekInOut has corroborated the rumours via its own sources \"with knowledge of Konami's plans\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With the overall Trails series rapidly nearing the conclusion of the epic story it’s been building up for the last couple of decades, Falcom has now released The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, allegedly the final release in this arc. This sophomore outing for Van and crew feels a little more uneven than its predecessor, but is ultimately a worthwhile new entry.\nThe plot picks up not too long after the previous game, starting once again with protagonist Van Arkride taking a midday nap on the couch in his office. He’s soon visited by his old friend Elaine from the Bracer Guild, who alerts him to reports of a new serial killer on the loose in Calvard. As the local Spriggan (a sort of private investigator), this would already be in Van’s wheelhouse, but there’s an additional detail that raises the stakes: the killer somehow has their own Grendel form, which was previously thought to be unique to Van. The two thus set out on the trail (heh) to track down the killer.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.\nWe’re not here to answer that, though.

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.\n Read more",

Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis.

Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.\n Read more",

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become \"a more agile, focused studio\", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.\r\n\n\r\nAll of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're \"taking the opportunity to reimagine\" how BioWare operate between projects, and \"have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.\" Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.\nRead more",

The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.\nIt isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.\nRead more",

          "description": "My favourite genre of YouTuber is: \"person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it\".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.\nRead more",

          "description": "A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

          "description": "Unlocking the option to play with other humans (multiplayer) increases the scope of Civilization 7 by a massive margin, as it allows you to test your wits and strategization powers to the fullest.\n\n\nWhile the AI can prove to be a stern test, it can feel repetitive after a while. Thankfully, Civilization 7 fully supports multiplayer, as you can play with your friends to find out who's the best. In fact, the presence of online play also raises the scope for playing with strangers over the internet or organizing local events.\n\n\nHow to setup multiplayer in Civilization 7\n\n\nTo play online, you'll have to open a 2K account. This step is free, but it's mandatory for any online session. If you already have an account, just log in.\n\n\nOnce you're signed into your 2K account, you'll be able to join a lobby and participate in the game present on it. Alternatively, you can even create your own lobby and invite your friends/other players to participate. Civilization 7 offers you full control over your lobby, as you can tweak the basic rules, decide on the starting age, and more.\n\n\nYou can also enjoy an offline multiplayer mode, which works via a functioning LAN network. This is suitable if you and your friends are present at the same location and have multiple devices. It's a great alternative to the online system. If you're on a console, you'll need an applicable subscription to host/participate in the online sessions.\n\n\n\n\nDoes Civilization 7 have hot seat multiplayer?\n\n\nAs of the early access, there is no hot seat multiplayer function. Having the feature is perfect if you're looking to introduce the game to your friends, as they can play on the same device. There's always a chance for the feature to be introduced later as part of a future update.\n\nThe post How to play multiplayer in Civilization 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're planning to add these limited Eels to your Beastiary, this guide can help you. Here's how to catch the Lovestorm Eel in Roblox Fisch.\n\n\nBefore you catch a Lovestorm Eel\n\n\nImage via Fisch Discord\n\n\nBefore you catch these limited Eels, keep in mind that they can only be caught during the Lovestorm event. Simply log in during the Valentine's event, do your usual thing, and wait for a message to pop at the top that says that the Lovestorm event has started. Head to the location, look for the fish pool (obviously, use a fish tracker to find the pool), and start casting.\n\n\nHow to catch a Lovestorm Eel\n\n\nLovestorm Eels are really difficult to catch. You'll know you hooked one if you get a whopping -90% Progression Speed. It's definitely going to be a long battle, so it's advised you equip yourself with a rod that boosts progression (A Zeus Rod, Kraken Rod, or the No-Life Rod are fantastic for this). Check out our Complete Fisch Roblox Rod List, Locations, & Crafting Recipes if you need help with finding any of these.\n\n\nImage via Fisch Discord\n\n\nWhile the Lovestorm Eel is going to be a bright Valentine pink, you can also catch many of its mutated forms.\n\n\nThat's all there is to it. Good luck with catching a Lovestorm Eel, and don't forget about everything else in the Valentines Update. If you need a boost, check out our Fisch codes guide.\n\nThe post How to catch Lovestorm Eeel for that special someone in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Gaming offers a respite from reality, an escape from responsibility, and a challenge if you’re feeling like nothing is pushing you hard enough. \n\n\nHowever, life is hectic. It’s not always possible to sit down and commit hours to grinding through an RPG or playing through other people’s lives in life sims. Sure, you might want to curl up and spend your evenings trudging through warzones or building civilizations, but real life must take precedence and children, work, pets, and frankly, sleep are all more important even if they’re not as much fun. \n\n\nIf that’s the case, how can you stay up to date with recent releases in a deeper and more meaningful way than just watching the trailer?

Official updates have been sparse, but according to a new message posted by the operators, they're having trouble paying the bills. Further details are lacking, but the call for help resulted in a healthy stream of crypto donations, which will be of interest to anti-piracy groups too.  \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "A Nintendo lawsuit filed last November targeted video gamer Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru. Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
