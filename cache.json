Well, if Paper Mario, Metroid Dread, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and now, Splatoon 3 are anything to go by, we'd err on the side of caution and get those spoiler barricades at the ready.\nLast week, we reported on Splatoon 3's story popping up on certain sections of Reddit thanks to early releases of the game appearing online. We are well aware that this information may have passed some Octoling aficionados by, so we are here to flag once and for all, Splatoon spoiler season is upon us.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"You've got my blessing!\".\nOne of the biggest surprises of the year was undoubtedly the launch of Portal and Portal 2 via the Portal: Companion Collection on Switch. Widely regarded as two of the greatest video games of all time, the ports run like butter on Nintendo's hybrid console, no doubt introducing a swathe of new players to the world of Aperture Science along with characters like Wheatley and the esteemed GlaDOS.\nOne of the running jokes with Valve is that the publisher is seemingly incapable of creating a third entry to their popular IP. Franchises like Left 4 Dead, Portal, and Half-Life have all more or less come to an end with their respective sophomore titles (though you could argue that Half-Life Alyx is technically the third mainline entry to the Half-Life series), but this hasn't stopped fans from requesting and petitioning for more of that Valve goodness.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

On the one hand you get to see the origins of some of your favourite games - with poorer graphics and mechanics to boot - but on the other you occasionally experience a sense of delayed loss, especially when seeing footage from a game that never saw the light of day.\nWe are currently in the stages of something like this after watching GameXplain's latest video (thanks, Go Nintendo for the heads up) which breaks down footage from a Japanese promotional video for the Super Mario 64 soundtrack - pfft, as if those bangers needed promotion. Aside from some pre-release Mario footage, the advert also contains a small number of clips from the cancelled Kirby's Air Ride game on the N64. Some of this footage has appeared online in the past, though the higher quality of this video really gives us a sneak peek at what the console's puff-ball racer could have been.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

During the late '90s to mid-2000s we would get varied games like Berserk: Guts’ Rage, and Arc System Works’ Fist of the North Star. Aside from Dragon Ball — which in the last few years has gotten an RPG, 2D fighter, and even a Dead By Daylight clone — most anime series are relegated to 3D arena fighting games like My Hero: One’s Justice or the Attack On Titan duology.\nJojo’s Bizarre Adventure is no different. Gone are the days of Capcom’s excellent 2D fighter Heritage for the Future, and Japan-only beat 'em up GioGio’s Bizarre Adventure; instead, console entries over the last decade have followed that same style with games like Eyes of Heaven and appearances in Shonen Jump crossover games like Jump Force. The one outsider was 2013’s All-Star Battle, which was a more traditional fighter. Nine years later, it makes its way to modern platforms in the form of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R, an updated entry that makes some good changes but ultimately doesn’t fix problems the initial game had.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A cause for celebration for some, this release date delay might have been the perfect opportunity to provide some more information about the upcoming animated feature; but whenever we have gone looking for news it appears that all updates were moved to another castle.\nThat's until now (well, almost). As noted yesterday by @DespicableOutof on Twitter, the movie now has an initial listing on the Illumination Studios Paris website, meaning we might finally have an idea of what this 'Mario Movie' will be called. After months of fumbling around for the right answer - is it The Mario Movie? Super Mario?

          "description": "The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. \nIn Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line. \nRead more",

Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It's ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it's invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30. \nRead more",

In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.\r\n\n\r\nWildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.\nNeowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.\nOverall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons.

          "description": "A few weeks ago we posted about a stellar deal on Lenovo's BoostStation, an external GPU enclosure that lets you turn almost any Thunderbolt 3 laptop into a gaming powerhouse with the simple addition of a graphics card. Rather than the £200 or £300 prices we normally see attached to these enclosures, this one was available at just £93. Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. \nThis time though, you'll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again. \nRead more",

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.\nTo call Northern Journey \"retro\" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action.

I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.\r\n\n\r\nVentura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.\r\n\n\r\nWhile it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don't have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as \"Project Code Name 'M'\" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nightdive's remake of 1994 classic System Shock hasn't had the smoothest development run, first having some money issues in its Kickstarter a while back, then having to reboot itself with twenty-twenty-something release dates chucked out there more as hopeful concepts than assurances. \nHaving gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I'm unsure whether it'll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.\nRead more",

          "description": "We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.\r\n\n\r\n“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console.

I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.\nRead more",

This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued. \nRead more",

It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.\nLet's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model. \nRead more",

Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.\r\n\n\r\nYou'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.\r\n\n\r\nMuch like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.\nSo going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sony veteran bows out after decades-long tenure\nSony Interactive Entertainment has announced that one of the PlayStation brand's longest-running developers, Masayasu Ito, will retire from the company at the end of September. Ito's departure was first communicated to Bloomberg, before the publisher made its own statement on the official SIE website.\nMasayasu Ito started with Sony way back in 1986, where he worked on the company's range of vehicular stereo systems — back when audio equipment was the cornerstone of Sony's technological output. Ito would not join the PlayStation brand until the year 2000, when his design know-how would be put to use in the development of PS2 accessories.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaAY-jAjm0w&t=1s\nIto would become a key player in the division, becoming the lead architect for the PS4 and PS4 Pro consoles, as well as the popular handheld console PlayStation Portable (PSP). Most recently, Ito had the unenviable task of engineering Sony's most recent hardware release, PS5. Creating powerful, next-gen technology against the backdrop of severely hampered production, component, and distribution shortages is no small feat, though the console would see its heralded arrival on November 12, 2020.\nIto's contribution to the PlayStation brand's success in the past two decades is clearly his legacy, having overseen the release of some of the best-selling game consoles of all time. Ito will retire from Sony on October 1, 2022, when he will be replaced by Lin Tao, who currently serves as SIE's SVP of Finance, Corporate Development, and Strategy.\nThe post PlayStation hardware architect Masayasu Ito to retire this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

While I enjoyed the original back when it was released, I merely rented the sequel. Then my brother-in-law and I just messed around in co-op and I never made it anywhere. However, the fun with physics gameplay left such an impression on me that it’s been on my hit list for years. The problem is, the memory that stuck out most for me was its ugly-as-sin graphics and oppressive draw fog.\nThankfully, THQ Nordic and Black Forest Games decided to go all the way with the series and gussy up Destroy All Humans 2 in the same way it did for the original title. That means, while the graphics have been upgraded to the nines, the warts of the PS2-era gameplay are still present underneath. …",

Hailing from Detroit is Riley Stone, a rocker who came up through the indie music scene. Meanwhile Rochelle Robert is a former child pageant star who gets discovered and makes her way into the spotlight.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5LO9H8YCfM\nThe two collide and grow closer, and it's your job to figure out how, why, and what happened after. Riley & Rochelle lets you piece together music, journal entries, and information to figure out the story. Maybe, even, whether anyone gets a decent ending.\nThe game is a collaboration between Tim Sheinman and Natalia Yanchak, with art from Mack Chater, Murray Somerwolff, and Josiah Whitfield. And the Sheinman Games label is what caught my eye about this in the first place.\n\nHe was a boy, she was a girl\nSheinman has made several investigation-centric games in the past. One in particular I dug was Rivals, a similar mix of music and detective work that had the player piece together the history of a band and its falling out.\nJust the general idea of pulling together scraps of info for a VH1's Behind The Music style program is interesting enough. But the music here is spot-on, too. A clever mix of information hunting and good tunes makes for a pretty unique style of detective game.\nRiley & Rochelle is currently aiming for a launch on PC and Mac. You can head on over and wishlist it on Steam at this link.\nThe post Riley & Rochelle is a detective game about uncovering a musical love story appeared first on Destructoid.",

Drop into the stream tonight to test this one out with us! It's super highly rated on Steam despite being a newer niche pick, but that's perfect. See you there!\nDrop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.\nThe post We’re streaming The Bridge Curse: Road to Salvation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Kratos is still learning some new tricks\nGod of War Ragnarok is on its way, with some all-new battles for Kratos and his son Atreus to wind up in. Today, we got a quick hit of some combat, showing off new moves Kratos will have in November.\nAs part of Game Informer's cover story for Ragnarok, the team has already talked about changes coming to Kratos' arsenal. Today's video shows just what that looks like in action. We see him running around an arena, beating the daylights out of some merfolk-looking enemies.\nA key component of Kratos' move set, as the video describes, is the idea of playing with your food. The god of war can really send enemies flying and bouncing around, as well as employ some elemental moves.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZhk4w66_8\nThese elemental moves are part of a new system for Kratos' weapons. The Leviathan Axe can bring out frost magic, while the Blades of Chaos elicit fire. By holding or mashing the Triangle button, the weapons become infused with the elements, doing extra damage to enemies.\nHe's really in his element here\nIt's a quick little burst of gameplay, with the video coming in at under two minutes. Still, it's nice to see some gameplay of God of War Ragnarok. I've been curious as to how different the combat would feel in Ragnarok versus the 2018 iteration. Seems like Sony Santa Monica Studios have found some ways of adding on top of what was already a pretty solid set of mechanics.\nThe written portion of Game Informer's cover story also talks about the shields, both the Dauntless and Stonewall versions, as well as some other granular bits of gameplay detail. It might still seem far away, but November is inching ever closer. And with it, plenty more enemies for Kratos to smash apart.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok shows off a quick burst of combat in new gameplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Clear space on the shelf, you're gonna need it\nElden Ring is a massive game -- not only in its sprawling map that provides hundreds of hours of gameplay, but also in the cultural impact it's had in games this year. It's fitting, then, that FromSoft is releasing an equally massive two-volume art book collection (via PC Gamer), each of which is 400 pages long. They've released a book of concept art for every game since Dark Souls, but this will be the longest one in the collection by far.\nVolume 1 will focus on the art of locations, NPCs, and armor, and Volume 2 will feature enemies, weapons, and items. The books are available to purchase individually for $31 each, or if you're an Elden Ring superfan, you can buy the set in the Ultra Edition, which retails for $125 and comes with a box to house the books, as well as a framed art print featuring everyone's favorite boss, Godfrey.\nThe Elden Ring art books are out on November 30 in Japan, and while we don't have a release date for other regions just yet, it can't be too far behind.\n\nSomething else to look forward to are the interviews with the Elden Ring design team, including director Hidetaka Miyazaki, that are a staple of the books.\nWe haven't had those interviews officially confirmed for the Elden Ring books, but they've always been a staple, so it would be a surprise if they weren't included. Because the FromSoft art books have been such a tradition, a lot of the unknown info feels more like a \"when\" rather than an \"if.\"\nWhile I don't have any of the Soulsborne art books yet myself, I do have plenty of others. Art in games is always so unique, plus it's cool to see how elements like characters and environments have evolved over the course of a game's development.\nConsidering Elden Ring has one of the most beautiful open worlds in games, it's pretty much a guarantee that this is gonna be a must-have for art book collectors.\nThe post The Elden Ring art book is massive with two volumes and 800 pages appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a new gameplay walkthrough, we got a good glimpse at all the ways players will be able to get around and use their powers.\nTchia is a new open-world adventure following protagonist Tchia. She's on a quest to rescue her father, and she'll need the help of both her tools and some impressive soul powers to do it.\nA big feature of Tchia is being able to inhabit things, be they birds, lanterns, or fruits, and use them for different effects. As shown in this new gameplay walkthrough with game director Phil Crifo, there's a lot to do with them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri2OiksaV88\nEarly on, Tchia inhabits a bird and soars around, providing a good view. Later, Tchia jumps into a lantern and flings it at an enemy, lighting them on fire. Rad! Crifo even shows off soul jumping into a coconut.\nYou might wonder why anyone would soul jump into a coconut. Well, Crifo shows how throwing an object with the throw mechanic, then leaping into it to gain momentum. It makes me think speedruns for this could be really interesting.\nHey, soul sister\nThe walkthrough shows off a bunch of ways for getting around the island, from tree-hopping to sailing. And it caps off with a little ditty with one of Tchia's pals, using the fully playable ukulele. No, they do not play Wonderwall.\n\nTchia has looked pretty rad so far in its showings, mixing open-world action-adventure mechanics with a gorgeous island world inspired by New Caledonia. While it got a delay earlier this year that's pushed it into 2023, I'm really intrigued to see more of this world and what players can discover in it.

The studio announced today that it is ending feature development on its portal-based shooter Splitgate, and moving on to a new game.\nIn a new statement shared on the Splitgate site, 1047 says that the FPS has reached a level of success it could not have anticipated. This has led to the studio growing substantially and bringing on new talent. It's also meant a lot of time trying to rework older content and systems, in what it characterizes as \"bailing water\" from a ship.\nIn light of this, 1047 Games has decided to build something new. And to do so, it's ending feature development on Splitgate.\n\"We’re turning our attention away from iterative, smaller updates and going all-in to focus on a new game in the Splitgate universe which will present revolutionary, not evolutionary, changes to our game. It will be a shooter, it will have portals, and it will be built in Unreal Engine 5. Oh, and it will be free.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5XKcTM_NM8\nA portal to a new world\nThat doesn't mean Splitgate is going away, though. 1047 Games says Splitgate will remain online, as will items and progression. There's also a new Battle Pass rolling out on September 15. The pass will be free for everyone, as a thank-you to everyone who's played Splitgate.\nSupport will also continue, though it will be limited in scope to smaller updates and fixes. The bulk of 1047's focus, the studio says, will be on an entirely new shooter.\nSplitgate started out as an interesting combination of Portal and Halo, which worked pretty well at the time for those waiting on Halo Infinite. It's since grown to be its own thing, and it'll be interesting to see what 1047 does with a new engine, larger team, and all the lessons learned from making Splitgate.\nThe post Splitgate feature development is ending, as 1047 moves to a new shooter appeared first on Destructoid.",

The bite-sized format is such a great way to end the day.\nRisk and Reward\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqEykD5Ub4\nIn this video, Sakurai uses the ever-popular game Space Invaders to illustrate the concept of risk and reward, and how a careful balance of both can lead to a more engaging experience.\nGame Development Isn't a Game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlFkxfkICO8\nIn the vein of many, many GDC and DICE-esque talks (albeit with his signature light touch), Sakurai warns folks that making games isn't always fun and games.\nDown with Lag!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoKKyskco4\nIn a segment called \"grab bag,\" Sakurai talks about miscellaneous topics: this one deals with response time and input delay in a more digestible, less technical format. It also has a nice little anecdote about how he was shocked at the amount of lag during a live Nintendo game demonstration!\nThe post Sakurai’s YouTube success points to him living his best life appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The City of Steel\nFallout 76 Season 10 has been revealed, and it'll debut alongside the massive upcoming update for The Pitt on September 13.\nAs usual, the \"seasonal\" approach is mostly a high-level aesthetic sheen on the modern season pass, complete with a reward track. Bethesda says this will be the \"first time ever\" that you can unlock gear crafting recipes, which is sure to ruffle some feathers. For the most part though, Season 10 is business as usual. The 100-ish rank system is still in place, but this time the rewards are themed around the rust-filled Pitt locale.\nHere's the full description from the team:\n\"Enjoy the city of the future, brought to you by Red Rocket, as you accrue S.C.O.R.E. and progress through 100 ranks of rewards. Unlock new gear and cosmetics as well as tons of currency to spend, including Atoms, Caps and even Stamps to trade for new Expedition-related goods. Fallout 1st members can unlock even more in Season 10, including exclusive rewards and even bonus S.C.O.R.E. boosts that last throughout the Season for active members!\"\n\nWhile the setup isn't that exciting, it does come with the Pitt update itself, which can be played while ignoring the season pass system wholesale. And of course, playing it at any point after the addition of The Pitt will include all of the iterative content released so far after the underwhelming launch. For folks that have avoided it thus far: the prospect of randomly playing it on Game Pass one weekend keeps getting more enticing.\nHere's the full schedule for the Fallout 76 Season 10 lead-in, as well as beyond:\nSeptember 1 – 6: Scrip Surplus Weekend\nSeptember 8 – 12: Legendary Purveyor Sale (up to 25% off) AND Double Mutations Weekend\nSeptember 13: The Pitt & Season 10 launch\nSeptember 22 – 26: Double Mutations Weekend\nSeptember 29 – October 3: Scrip Surplus Weekend, Gold Rush Weekend, AND Minerva’s Big Sale\nThe post Fallout 76 Season 10 will add the ability to craft new seasonal gear appeared first on Destructoid.",

After a series of confusing videos that didn't exactly showcase the game in the best light, we finally got a look at Cyber Space, and a glimpse into the narrative. This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer (which reiterates the November 8 release date) basically compiles all of that into one digestible package.\nClocking in at roughly three minutes, this new video from the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube account is actually pretty helpful! It starts at the literal beginning, with Sonic, Amy, and Tails chilling, before they're \"sucked into a dimensional portal to Cyber Space, then ends up on the Starfall Islands.\" It then moves into a mechanical perspective, talking up its open world (which it calls \"open-zone platforming\") and \"the freedom to play the game in the order that matches your playstyle.\" A slight overview of the combat system and in-game puzzles are also touched on.\nThere's also a crucial part that actually talks about how critical path story progress is made. You'll defeat bosses to earn \"Portal Gears,\" which in turn unlock Cyber Space stages. Once you finish challenges therein, you'll then earn keys that can be used to unlock Chaos Emerald vaults to \"progress farther in the game.\" That seems to be the loop!\nHopefully that can last for —I'm going to guess — 10-15 hours, and beyond? Either way, they should have led with some of these videos (especially Cyber Space) out of the gate.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leLnp4XCBr4\nThe post This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer tells you everything you need to know appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Unearthed Treasure\nTokyo Game Show is yet to officially get underway, but already it seems that some of its surprises are just too durn exciting to keep under wraps. According to a new leak uncovered by Gematsu, legendary shmup developer Treasure is getting set to reveal a new project under the banner of one of its best-loved IPs, Radiant Silvergun.\nGematsu found evidence of a new Radiant Silvergun title after poking around the TGS website uploaded by publisher Happinet. Alongside assets and titles pulled from over 30 franchises was a brand new logo simply depicting \"Radiant Silvergun,\" complete with a silhouette of the game's iconic starship. Treasure, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, will apparently be showcasing the new title at this year's TGS, which will no doubt get retro game fans and shmup aficionados into a suitable tizzy.\nRadiant Silvergun was released in Japanese arcades in May 1998, before finding its way onto the Sega Saturn in the console's twilight years. For the longest of times, it would remain something of an urban legend among western players, available only via expensive imports and poor early-day emulation. The classy shmup would eventually be ported to Xbox 360 in 2011, which represented the title's first, readily available, global release. Today, Radiant Silvergun still stands proud, holding a deserved reputation as a genuine classic of the genre.\nWhat form this project will take remains to be seen, but I would think a remaster or remake is more likely than a sequel. In either case, we won't have to wait too much longer to find out, as Tokyo Game Show will kick off September 15, emanating from Chiba's Makuhari Messe complex. We will bring you all of the details from Radiant Silvergun (and many other TGS exclusives) right here on Destructoid.\nThe post New Radiant Silvergun project leaks ahead of Tokyo Game Show appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.\n1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. \nAs such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. \nYou can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):\nSplitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.",

Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice?

Discovery confirms. \nThe first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

          "description": "Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: \n\nFor more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that. \nWhich Hogwarts House are you in?

          "description": "After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real and we'll be learning more about it next week.\nThat's because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we'll learn more about the future of Assassin's Creed and more. It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. \nAssassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/92LoEcrrWs\nSeptember 1, 2022\nIf rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!\nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. \nAre you excited about Mirage?

          "description": "In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",

The series’ current direction is inspired by an old studio motto: Playing with your food.\n“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”\nFor seven minutes, I follow Kratos and Atreus across an enclosed arena chockful of explosive p…",

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

          "description": "Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. \nThis news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with.

          "description": "Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.",

Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous.

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?
