          "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 won't be an \"open sim\" like the 2004 original game, according to Paradox Interactive. Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been \"mythologised\" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply \"wouldn't fly today\".\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

          "description": "A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.\nIn which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.\nRead more",

But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.\nThere's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. \n Read more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.\nAnd then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.\nRead more",

Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.\nMetaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.\nRead more",

I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.\nAt the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl.

          "description": "My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.\nLurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. \r\n \nRead more",

Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.\nRead more",

Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, \"interoperable\" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not.

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.\n  \nRead more",

While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going \"boo!\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. \r\n \nRead more",

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.\nThere's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.\nRead more",

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. \r\n\n\r\nConversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.\nI go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably.

          "description": "In a major surprise, EA FC 25 has received the Live Tuning 1 Update, which has brought some major gameplay changes.\n\n\nUnlike Title Update 1, players won't have to download any major patches, as the changes will be applied in real time. EA Sports has already uploaded the patch notes for the first update, which can be viewed on the official Trello. While there are exactly three changes in this patch, all of them will definitely have a telling impact on gameplay.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Live Tuning 1 Update patch notes\n\n\nIf you've focused on the recent meta inside EA FC 25, you'll know how effective first-time lob passes and speed boosts have been. Combining the R2 and L1 buttons has often led to skilful players creating a lot of space, which often seemed unnatural. It's now been proven that incidents from the recent past were all unintended results.\n\n\n\nReduced ball trajectory height for Lobbed Passes and Crosses performed in Rush matches.\n\n\nReduced accuracy of first-time Lobbed Through Passes and Lobbed Through Passes taken at severe angles.\n\n\n\nAddressed the following issue:\n\n\n\n[PS5/PC/XBSX|S Only] Reduced instances of players accelerating unintentionally quickly when a Sprint is requested.\n\n\n\nLobbed Passes and Lobbed Through Passes have been unrealistically accurate in certain instances. That problem should no longer be an issue after the first Live Update of EA FC 25. However, a much more important change is the complete nerf of the R2 speed boost.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to EA Sports, the space being created by players was unintentionally quick. It's unclear as to how big a change it is by the developers. One thing for certain: this one shift will have a huge impact on the market. Certain cards have been panic sold by a part of the community already, and there could be bigger ramifications ahead of the next Champions Finals.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Live Tuning 1 Update nerfs speed boost and aerial lobs appeared first on Destructoid.",

Season 1 often left me guessing to the point where I just couldn't flat-out anticipate what would come next. And by the time I reached its finale, I was left wondering, \"What's next for our boys in the big blue?\"\n\n\nSeason 2's first episode captures that same essence of unpredictability in an entirely unique way, blending new and familiar faces alike. You'll know exactly who the key players are by the look 'em. Just spot the ones with vibrant hair colors or an updo that would make Goku proud, and you've got your main cast. Even though the name of the game remains the same, Blue Lock Season 2 Episode 1 kicks off with a bang, leading the way for a thrilling new arc. \n\n\nThe last time we saw Isagi Yoichi and the rest…",

If there's an infinite loading circle, then you simply need to refresh the page, and it should fix itself. \n\n\nOn this page, you'll find two tabs for your account alongside the character for which you're claiming rewards. All you need to do now is scroll through the pages, click on whatever items are shining, and then click Claim. From there, they should be added to your Destiny 2 account.

          "description": "One of the new features added to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of the Jungle Getaway update on October 9 is the ability to hold tools or hand accessories in Photo Mode, and it’s a great way to add some life to your shots. \n\n\nWhichever hand accessory you’ve got equipped when entering Photo Mode will be the one appearing in the shot. If you want to use a specific hand accessory, then you’ll need to select it through the Wardrobe Menu prior to entering Photo Mode. \n\n\nHow to equip tools and hand accessories in Photo Mode\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou cannot equip tools or hand accessories in the portrait mode of Photo Mode, but you can equip anything that you like in wider shots. To do so, enter Photo Mode and then press the button marked “Change Camera Mode.”\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThen, in the menu at the bottom right of the screen, you can usually choose how you stand or whether you want to pose with your companion. Here, all of your tool icons will be displayed, and you can equip any of them. You’ll always stand in your idle stance, as you do when holding your tool outside of Photo Mode.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Umbrella icon is the one that allows you to hold your equipped accessory. To change your accessory, you’ll need to exit out of Photo Mode and instead open the Wardrobe Menu. Select ‘Accessory”, pick the one you want, and then go back into Photo Mode and follow the steps above to get your shot!\n\n\nIf you've ever purchased tool skins from the Premium Shop, they will also appear in Photo Mode, so now is a good time to show off your personalized style and get more use out of your hard-earned tools.\n\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley: How to equip tools and hand accessories in Photo Mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge without breaking the bank. \n\n\nEA FC 25 RTTK Challenge 6 SBC tasks\n\n\nThe RTTK Challenge 6 SBC has only one task, and here are its conditions. \n\n\nTask 1 - RTTK Challenge 6 SBC\n\n\n\nMax.

The prices of some of these items can go up if multiple players bid for one or more of these cards to complete the challenge. \n\n\nAfter completing the SBC, you'll get an untradeable Prime Gold Players Pack for you to use in Ultimate Team. The pack contains 12 Gold Player items, and six of them are guaranteed to be Rare.

          "description": "Boundary of Deduction is a quest in Wuthering Waves that involves solving a puzzle with a solution that isn't so obvious. If you're struggling to figure out what you need to do, here's how you can get through it.\n\n\nHow to finish Boundary of Deduction in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nBoundary of Deduction is located within one of the side rooms in the Error Cell of Tethys' Deep. To gain access to this quest, you must first finish the main Black Shores storyline first and foremost. Fortunately, the storyline isn't too long, so you can probably do so in one setting.\n\n\nOnce you have the Boundary of Deduction quest, you're tasked with making two nearly identical rooms the same by switching computers on and off. A portal in the area reveals that there are two rooms, and while both rooms appear the same (apart from the lighting) at the start, there is a key difference.\n\n\nThe computers on the table in the middle of both rooms can be toggled on and off, and you must match the red room's computers with the main room's. This is done by going up to one of the monitors present and interacting with them. This will change their state, letting you complete the questline.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nRemember that the rooms are mirrors of each other and appear as such when you look through the portal on either side. I recommend looking at the door in the back of both rooms as the door makes it easy to tell which side of the room you're on when turning computers on and off.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you've successfully mirrored the rooms, the quest will update, and you'll need to talk to the scientist outside the red room. The door in the red room will open up, allowing you to do so.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nSpeak with the NPC, and the quest will end, rewarding you with useful Asterite for your trouble.\n\nThe post How to complete Boundary of Deduction in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají \"trochu divní\". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)",
