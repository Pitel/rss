Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:\nIf we could give an RPS 'Bestest Best in show' award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game's dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler's visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.\nWe have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag.

I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:\nWhat really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.\nThere's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It's goofy fun, and we're completeley smitten with it.\n Read more",

          "description": "I've played a bunch of indie game demos at PAX East, but none left my head reeling as much as 43 Studios' fiendishly frantic action platfotmer Hell Of An Office. It's a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:\nHell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you're tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell's scorching pools.\nIf you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it's way through Early Access.\n Read more",

You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:\nIn Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.\nFrom playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.\n Read more",

There's a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we've chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.\nEverything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West's multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it's nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.\nSome of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.\n Read more",

Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”\r\n\n\r\nEvery so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic.

It was a fun, nostalgic way to let fans reminisce on the game’s infantile days. Ghost Ship had planned to remove Legacy today - March 23rd - but after fan feedback, they’ve decided to keep Legacy edition around indefinitely.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Well, I say 'see'. In truth, I was tucked away backstage at this year's IGF and GDC Awards, clutching my dictaphone with a single question in mind: if each winner had to give away their award to another game in their category, who would it be and why?   \nIt's an idea Brendan (RPS in peace) came up with back in the primordial mists of 2018, and it was so good I just had to knick it and do it again. It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it's all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise. So here are the games of the year 2022, according to the people who just won awards for games of the year 2022.\nRead more",

We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It's a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.\nI had a chat with Demonschool's Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game's many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game's trailer and demo is anything to go by, we're in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:\n\nIf you've haven't yet, set your peepers on Demonschool's slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There's no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.\nWe've got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag. \n \nRead more",

          "description": "Men Of War 2 doesn't do anything by half measures, as I discovered during a recent tussle with its online multiplayer modes. Whereas Relic's recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That's a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that's before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it's a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. \nCrucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let's face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we're here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here's my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.\nRead more",

There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn't possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I've only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They're forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you'll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that's white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. \nIt's unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that's the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you'll find in Davy Jones' locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what's out there, whether it's real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you'll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.\nRead more",

The other nomination was for Excellence In Design, which went to the also excellent The Case Of The Golden Idol, proving that, yep, once again the RPS Advent Calendar is at the forefront of great indie taste-making.

It's playful and cute, with surprising depth that draws inspiration from classic stories. It's also very short. I'd wager you'll have hunnerpercented Storyteller in two hours max, which will sound like mana from heaven to some, but may disappoint you if you've been waiting for Storyteller for over a decade.\nRead more",

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.\nWell, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.\nRead more",

It feels like every classic from Resident Evil 4 to Final Fantasy 7 is getting a shiny facelift, reimagining the polygonal blocks from yesteryear and turning them into scarily realistic blockbusters. But, every so often I get an itch. An itch to go back in time to my low-detail-graphics childhood, sitting on the floor, looking up at a squared CRT. And that’s what a good demake is for; specifically, the Dead Space Demake.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. \nNot only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.\nRead more",

It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer's RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we'd still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production. For gaming and regular use though, this is a great choice! \nRead more",

Instead, I’ve been playing Diablo 4’s beta, closed to all except an elite cadre of press, pre-orderers, and, uh, chicken enthusiasts. And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.\r\n\n\r\nMouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a \"reimagining\" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. \nI recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.\nFor eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.\nWhat’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are \"looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary.\" You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.\nAll three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.\n Read more",

The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?\nRead more",

          "description": "Back like a Bat Outta Hell\nThis week's Arcade Archives addition is a real forgotten gem, and sees Hamster reach well into the past to deliver Taito's unique and mythical platformer Bonze Adventure to PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nOriginally released to the arcade market in 1989, before later finding fame in a successful PC Engine port, Bonze Adventure, (or Jigoku Meguri in its native Japan), sees a Buddist monk venture into the bowels of the underworld itself in order to confront its monarch, King Emma, who has gone a little bit doolally and has thus lost control of Hell's denizens, which are escaping into the human realm.\nCheck out the action in the video below, from no less than Hamster Corporation itself.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk1jszprGlQ&ab_channel=HAMSTERCorporation\nThe surprisingly holy adventure sees Bonze venture through Emma's domain, defending himself with powered Buddist \"Mala\" beads, and warding off an array of demons, monsters, ghosts, spiders, and other creepy enemies and he picks his ways through a variety of glum, but strangely cute, environments. Several powerups can be gathered, and help is occasionally provided by an arriving Deva. A neat mechanic sees time represented by a series of melting candles. Despite its success, both in arcades and on the PC Engine, Bonze Adventure would fall into relative obscurity, not receiving any sequels.\nBonze Adventure is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Bonze Adventure brings cutesy hell to Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Everybody do the side-step\nA new video from developer Arika appears to tease an update in the works for cult fighting title Fighting EX Layer — The video, which sees Fatal Fury's Terry Bogard facing off against FEXL's Allen Snider was released by the developer ahead of Japan's EVO 2023 tournament, which takes place in April.\nThe key reasoning behind the new video seems a little obscure as of this writing, though said video was followed up by a newer, better-looking version — suggesting that Arika is currently working on something in regards to the Street Fighter EX spin-off title. The most notable moment of this video sees Allen Snider perform several side steps, Tekken-style. This seems to suggest that a \"Dodge\" ability might be in the works — which would add a 3D element to the 2.5D fighter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-lMEydK10o&t\nA brief note accompanying the video references EVO Japan, and also asks fans to be patient with the quality of the video and its effects. The summary of this confusing content drop appears to suggest that Arika has something to show us at EVO Japan 2023, and that it might be a Fighting EX Layer update, complete with new mechanics and, potentially, tweaked visuals and special effects. Of course, we will be sure to give you all a heads-up once Arika's plan has been properly explained.\nFighting EX Layer launched on PS4 in the summer of 2018. Following a series of free post-release characters, the title would be successful enough to encourage Arika to develop a PC port later that year. In 2021, a complete edition titled Fighting EX Layer Another Dash was released for Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Arika video hints at possible mechanics update for Fighting EX Layer appeared first on Destructoid.",

When a seemingly can't-miss opportunity comes her way, Gloria finally realizes that this could be her chance to pull the fraying ends of her life together. But the human mind does not always allow for the best-laid plans, and Gloria's spiraling emotions may be about to manifest themselves very real-world nightmares.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmeL6rfuJS8&ab_channel=ShiroGames%7CUnlimited\nDecarnation will blend dramatic role-playing elements with puzzle action and elements of survival to create a uniquely creepy, brain-bending experience. With clear stylistic influences coming from the works of directors such as Satoshi Kon and David Lynch, as well as the familiar trappings of the giallo genre, Decarnation doesn't look like it will be standard \"OMG Zombies!\" horror title — instead reaching a little deeper into the darkness of the human soul, as it twists and bends to deal with the realities of the living, and unloving world.\nI'm keeping several eyes on this... including the ones growing out of my arms.\nDecarnation launches this May on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam).\nThe post Atelier horror title Decarnation looks like a Lynchian nightmare appeared first on Destructoid.",

This number represents the highest amount of Steam user concurrently playing any Resident Evil release at any one time, including previous remakes Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, as well as modern mainline sequels Resident Evil VII: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj9UeZzp12o&ab_channel=ResidentEvil\nClearly, the nostalgia factor of the original Resident Evil 4 — still considered a series highlight some 18 years on from its initial GameCube release — will help drive the new 2023 edition to incredible success.

While each successive game has seen Jack's visual style and overall sense of technical reliability improve, the character has consistently been a heavy power hitter, taking down his opponents with huge, clubbing blows and an increasingly ridiculous range of weaponry and firepower. Let's take a look at Jack-8.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b4MyA6wPJI&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nFrom this first glance, Tekken 8's Jack-8 model looks incredibly — dare I say — \"Cyber\", somehow sporting a more futuristic design while still being oddly archaic in design. Still, despite his new look, our favorite metal man is still more than capable of flattening the opposition with the aforementioned haymakers and axhandles — given an extra boost in the form of explosive detonations on impact. To call it a day, Jack-8 calls in a ridiculously oversized energy cannon, wiping out the enemy, (and almost himself), with a devastating beam of raw power, not dissimilar to Iron Man's Proton Cannon from Marvel vs. Capcom.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, and Lars Alexandersson. We only need see the returning Jun Kazama and the opening salvo of the sequel's roster is complete.\nThe post Jack-8, the ‘High Tech Annihilator’, dominates in Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the game will see Gollum embark upon his own odyssey across Middle-Earth, meeting tentative allies and bitter enemies in his pursuit of the core of his being... \"The Precious\".\nYou can check out a new, lengthy gameplay showcase video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBqFV6EO80&ab_channel=Nacon\nDeveloped by Daedalic, this ambitious project has seen several setbacks since its initial reveal way back in the spring of 2019, but is finally on the road to fruition.

          "description": "Getting the band back together\nToday sees the launch of Capcom's highly anticipated remake, Resident Evil 4 — And for you zombie poppers fans out there, the publisher has finally announced a launch date for popular co-op mode The Mercenaries, which will arrive as a free update on all platforms Friday, April 7.\nMercenaries is a sometimes-multiplayer mode that first made its debut with the launch of the original GameCube edition of Resident Evil 4, back in 2005. The mode sees player/s battling it out against hordes of enemies against an incredibly strict time limit. Typically, the mode features several characters from the respective Resident Evil title, including side characters and other NPCs. The Mercenaries mode has since appeared in sequels such as Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 6, and, most recently, Resident Evil Village.\nResident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj9UeZzp12o&ab_channel=ResidentEvil\nThe post Resident Evil 4 Mercenaries mode launches April 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over here, stranger\nThe impact that Resident Evil 4 had on the industry can't be overstated. Mechanics that were refined in the title, such as the aiming and over-the-shoulder camera, became widespread in the console generation that followed. QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it's an important and well-loved title.\nWhen the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market. Now I know the answer.\n[caption id=\"attachment_369142\" align=…",

One crucial area where the company has failed for as long as it's been a household name is continuing access to legacy games. Since the NES was dropped in favor of the SNES, Nintendo fans have had to hold onto old hardware if they wanted to keep playing their favorite games from the previous generation. It hasn't always tripped up with this as anyone who kept playing their OG copy of Tetris on the Game Boy Advance SP can attest to.

Hailing from South Korea, Kim utilizes his incredible martial arts abilities to better the world, bestowing a sense of honor into all he meets and ensuring justice is seen to be done for those who have strayed from a path of enlightenment. Kim's role in KoF famously saw his endless efforts to rehabilitate criminals Choi Bounge and Chang Koehan. Despite his boy scout nature, Kim is a respected character among the SNK community.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO_GppPzlig&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nAs the above trailer demonstrates, Kim is bringing his iconic and acrobatic range of kicks to the King of Fighters XV party, including his range of devastating flying axe kicks, his gravity-defying headstomps, and his incredible, lightning-speed Supers. Sadly, Kim's iconic pants aren't quite as billowy as they were in his 2D days, but anybody picking up Kim as DLC will at least receive his classic costume as a bonus skin.

          "description": "Almost Unreal\nAs part of this week's Game Developer Conference (GDC) publisher Epic Games and developer Team Ninja has shone the light on the stunning facial animation tech that will be used to bring life and personality to the characters of long-in-development sequel Senua's Saga: Hellblade II.\nThe demonstration video shows off Unreal Engine's \"Metahuman\" technology, and features the face of actor Melina Juergens, who portrays the troubled Senua in the Hellblade series. The video begins with an extreme close-up of Senua's eyes, slowing pulling back as she delivers a dramatic monologue, before finally being lost in flickering flame. While the blending of reality and digital effects will almost always contain some element of the infamous \"Uncanny Valley\", it can't be denied that the technology is mightily impressive.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1qG8pREfkA&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=NinjaTheory\n\"This cloud-hosted tool allows you to create photorealistic digital humans for your game or experience, with the simplicity of an RPG character creator, yet with a level of realism and customization that you’ve never seen before,\" says Epic Games' chief technology officer Kim Librerim.\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II was first announced back in 2019, with only scant updates and previews offered on the grim-looking sequel. Given Hellblade II's core approach to psychological horror and deep, emotive characters, the Metahuman tech will allow the developers to best capture Juergens as she delivers what is expected to be another stellar lead performance. Should it be a success, we can likely expect to see other character-focused adventures experiment with the next-gen tech.\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Ninja Theory shows off Hellblade II’s stunning facial animation tech appeared first on Destructoid.",

While we reviewed The Isle Dragon Roars over a year ago, two more entries have released since then. As of this morning (thanks John!) a bundle has appeared on the Nintendo Switch eShop, which collects all three of them in one neat digital package.\nThe package is $49.99, and includes all three games. Described as a \"quirky series of RPGs where the whole world is depicted through the medium of cards\" (which is fairly apt!), this subseries has been gaining some traction in select communities, with the power of Square Enix-backed art behind it. Let's dig into what this bundle actually entails.\nDoes the Voice of Cards trilogy bundle save you any money or include the DLC?\nLet's take a look at what the current prices are on the eShop if you bought each Voice of Cards game piecemeal, compared to the $49.99 bundle:\nThe Isle Dragon Roars - $29.99\nThe Forsaken Maiden - $29.99\nBeasts of Burden - $29.99\nSo uh, you could say it saves you quite a bit! Of course there is DLC afoot for the series (it is Square Enix), but you're getting all three core games with the bundle.\nAbout that: there is another Trilogy + DLC set bundle for $64.99 if you want to go all-in. Here's what the DLC entails, straight from Square Enix: \"the designs of in-game items such as cards, playing pieces and tables to be styled after the games from the NieR series, DLC that changes the game music and DLC that changes the visuals for all characters and enemies to a pixel art style.\"\nVoice of Cards is also present on PS4, PC, and mobile devices, if you don't want to dump all the cash required on the Switch bundle.\nThe post If you’re interested in Voice of Cards, the trilogy just appeared on the Switch eShop appeared first on Destructoid.",

The chairman of Atari reportedly already owned a 13% minority stake in Nightdive, and the deal is for Atari to buy up 100% of the shares.\nNightdive Studios has long been a well-regarded developer of ports of older PC titles. Some of these endeavors have resulted in full source ports, as was the case in the move of Power Slave to their proprietary KEX Engine. Currently, Nightdive is working on a complete refurbishment of System Shock, which is slated for release May 30.\nFor Atari’s part, it has largely been pushing modernized versions of its legacy library with games like Yars: Recharged, which I haven’t played, but I can’t imagine it being much worse than 2011’s Yars Revenge reimagining. The company has been pretty shaky for years, though their reproduction of Atari games on authentic cartridges shows some respect for their properties, and the recent team-up with Digital Eclipse on the Atari 50 collection has yielded one of the best retro compilations in years. Maybe they’re turning a new leaf, and Nightdive will help steer them on a good path. Who knows?\nI’m trying to be optimistic. I have a lot of respect for Nightdive and not much for Atari. It’s like seeing your sibling hook up with the guy who’s best known for pooping himself in gym class. I’m trying to be optimistic. Maybe Atari’s pooping days are behind them. I guess we’ll have to wait and see.\nI reached out to Larry Kuperman, Director of Business Development at Nightdive Studios. He commented, \"A major factor in choosing to partner with Atari is that Nightdive will be able to continue our mission to bring back lost classics, but with greater resources available.\"\nThe post Atari enters agreement to purchase Nightdive Studios appeared first on Destructoid.",

The newest one involves two TMs (Thunder Wave and Taunt), and just requires a quick mystery gift code input.\nThanks to a new promo drop from Nintendo (credit to Profe Turo on Twitter for screenshotting the source), the code \"ENJOYBATTLE\" is now live for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. The code will run through April 30, 2023 at 23:59 UTC, so there's plenty of time to redeem it.\nhttps://twitter.com/ProfeTuro/status/1638890191988355074\nHere's what's on offer in this March Pokemon Scarlet & Violet mystery gift box:\nTM082 - Thunder Wave\nTM087 - Taunt\nOh hey, you might want to use taunt in a 7-star raid battle! Look, I know it's not super exciting, but it's something some of you may want to redeem. I'm doing my part!\nWe have a full breakdown on how to access the mystery gift system here. In short, it involves finishing up the tutorial (which requires you to get through the academy portion, after the bout with Arven) to fully unlock the required menu.\nOther currently live Pokemon Scarlet and Violet mystery gift codes:\nLETSTERA - TM171 - Tera Blast (March 31)\nMORESPEED - 10 Carbos items (March 31)\nThe post PSA: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have a new mystery gift through April 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.\nThe majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…",

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.\nA gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.\n\n\nAliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

          "description": "Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.

Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. \n\"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,\" Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. \"Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.\"\nWho knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell.
