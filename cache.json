Ultimate promised us the impossible: everyone is here. Yes, even Snake. No veteran fighter was to be left behind, and we got a slew of new fighters as well, mostly ones that fans had been clamoring after for decades such as King K. Rool and Ridley. Not long after, we were also promised DLC on top of all of that– Piranha Plant as a stand-alone DLC character (or you could get them for free by registering your digital/physical purchase), plus five additional mystery slots that could be purchased separately or all together as part of a 'Fighters Pass' package deal.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The classic top-down gameplay of the original was morphed into a faster, action-heavy side-scroller with Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, only to be abandoned for a return to form in A Link to the Past. While the promise of 3D worlds and Z-targeting eventually led Nintendo to abandon the classic top-down approach on consoles (Four Swords aside), traditional Zelda design lived on in the handheld realm. From Link's Awakening to Minish Cap, Link's overhead adventures continued, and sandwiched between these two were the interlinked Oracle games on the Game Boy Color.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.\nRead more",

Whether or not Doom 3’s shotgun is one of the good ones (it is).  \r\n\n\r\nIf there’s one area where all of the remake’s ideas truly come together and shine, it’s in the weapons. There wasn’t much to see in the original - nothing beyond the tip of a barrel. Here, the weapons are very much the star of the show. Heavy, industrial things covered in thumb-print smeared LCD screens and superfluous greeblies. NERF guns that've been painted by a 12-year-old and covered in spaceship parts. These are the toy guns you would have wanted for Christmas, and I wanted to know more about them.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sadly not: in a Reddit post addressing complaints of wonky performance, even on higher-end graphics cards, developers Gunfire Games admitted to having \"designed the game with upscaling in mind.\" \nWorking the likes of Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS into a game wouldn’t normally be a cause of incredulity. Indeed, as optional performance boosters, they’re pretty much always a welcome sight amid the duller texture filtering and ambient occlusion toggles of the average settings menu. The problem here is that with its dismal performance at native, non-upscaled resolutions, Remnant II essentially forgets about the 'optional' part – and in doing so, undermines what makes DLSS and its rivals such valuable tools in the first place.\nRead more",

          "description": "Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.\r\n\n\r\n“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.\r\n\n\r\n“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”\r\n \nRead more",

Getting everything in the right place. And something that makes it extra enjoyable in Unpacking is the sound design. The house itself is quiet, but everything in the game makes a little noise when you put it away or hang it up or slide it in a shelf, and it's all stuff you recognise from home.

I bash some skeletons, I equip a staff, I exit to Windows, I couldn't care less. Maybe, though, it's not such a bad thing?\nI know I said I'd like Diablo 4 to channel Vampire Survivors and give me an auto-attack switch, so I could just steer my character through encounters without having to think at all.

Sure, you could theoretically make meticulous notes about all the planetary symbols and construction costs of the various buildings you'll need to harvest and convert resources into fuel, alloys and elixirs as you hurtle through space trying to escape the terrifying Gloom based on its in-game manual. But when there's a physical paper booklet that replicates all that for you in a much more easily accessible format, with several gorgeous illustrations of its mysterious space monastery to boot, not to mention infinitely better explanations of what everything does than I could ever hope to describe, it's quickly become an essential part of my play experience. \nI'm still working on my review for The Banished Vault (hopefully coming later this week), but as it launches on Steam today, I'd strongly recommend spending the extra £5/$5 to get one if you're at all interested in Lunar Division's space survival management 'em up. I don't think I could have survived in the game without it.\nRead more",

And their answers gave us more of an insight into the game's early development, where the story might take you, and how you might overcome some of its trickiest nuts and bolts.\nWhile it won't come as much of a surprise to Armored Core veterans, Armored Core 6 isn't an open world game. If you're a new FromSoftware-liker brought on board by the expansive world of Elden Ring, then yes, you might be a bit surprised. As I mention in my preview, Armored Core 6 sees you play a mecha-mercenary who selects jobs from a drop down menu and jets off to destroy whatever needs destroying. But Yamamura says FromSoft actually considered going down a more open world route in early stages of the game's development.\nRead more",

It doesn't give you wings, but what it does give you is a mech as nimble as a Eurasian Blue Tit darting at a confetti of stale bread.\nAs a historic mech-disliker, the game actually managed to instil a desire to become a skilled mech pilot.

          "description": "Three decades have gone by since the original Myst graced the world, providing endless online debates about whether it's smart or just pretentious. Magical or plain bad. Some indie developers chose the latter with a Myst FPS remix that spoofed the senior adventure game. The RPS readership seemed split on the subject when we asked \"Have You Played Myst?\" years ago. But Humble Games leans toward the former as it’s choosing to celebrate the classic's whopping 30th birthday with a returning charity bundle, available now until August 3rd.\r\n\n\r\nThe Humble Myst & More Bundle packages the titular point-and-clicker, alongside several other sequels, spiritual successors, and odd offshoots from developer Cyan Worlds. You can pay anything over £7.80/$10 for the 11-game bundle, or you can pay at least £15.60/$20 to also grab the Myst remake from 2021. \r\n\n\r\nCyan Worlds loves a good re-release, and this latest bundle is a reminder of how many Mysts have Mysted over the years. There’s Myst: Masterpiece Edition which remasters the music and imagery, and is otherwise as close to the original as you can get. Then there’s realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which added changing weather, day-night cycles, free roam movement, and a bonus epilogue. And finally, there’s the most recent pretty remake that’s also compatible with VR.\r\n \nRead more",

She’s an amazing sword fighter; her acrobatic and graceful nature lets her outwit anyone who crosses her blade. She’s got panache, cheek, and a sharp wit to boot. And speaking of - her boots!

          "description": "With the news that Assassin’s Creed Mirage won’t get any post-launch DLC, we of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are wondering: what are some good games that only need playing once? Not out of a lack of enjoyment or interest, but because they were so satisfying that they left nothing else to want. Or because it would be too hard to recapture the joy of a first playthrough. Or maybe because they just ended really damn well. Whatever the reasoning, join us as we ponder our favourite games that we’ve never returned to.\r\n\n\r\nPlus! We chat about the games we have been playing, from Nate’s eel-dense management adventures in Clanfolk to my wilfully patch note-ignorant return to Minecraft. I also explain Team Fortress 2’s new seal mode, and Nate hijacks my thrilling hardware section on EU battery legislation to improvise a new trip up the Tower of Jocularity.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Based on the shooter series of the same name, the Borderlands film now has an official release date: August 9th, 2024. The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. \r\n\n\r\nThis comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.\r\n\n\r\nThe Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks. \r\n \nRead more",

With Bergamo the flagship AMD EPYC 9754 provides 128 cores with SMT and the Zen 4C cores still boast AVX-512. Another nifty aspect on this high core count CPU catering to cloud service providers is the adjustable TDP from 320 to Watts. Prior Phoronix benchmarks have looked at the default 360 Watt performance and the 400W at the high-end with power determinism mode while today's article is looking at the efficiency gains made possible by pulling back to a 320W cTDP.",

Intel's AVX10 announcement noted initial support with Granite Rapids processors that will debut next year but no mention of the E-core-only Sierra Forest. With the AVX10 only coming to P/E core client processors after Granite Rapids, it would appear the high density Sierra Forest generation will miss out on AVX10/AVX-512 and not appear until Clearwater Forest. Meanwhile with the 128-core AMD EPYC \"Bergamo\" processors now shipping, there is AVX-512 with the Zen 4C cores. Here are some benchmarks looking at the AVX-512 impact for Bergamo.",

Less than 10 days after announcing the return of Tanya, Li Mei, and Baraka, the developer is back with a new trailer. But this one is focused on just one fighter: Geras. This time manipulator is the first character from Mortal Kombat 11 to be confirmed for MK1, bringing along some new moves that look slow but are sure to be powerful.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72okJYRJWDI\nI'm still not totally on board with the Kameo system, but watching him swing Darrius around sure looks fun.\nI didn't expect any of the three new fighters from MK11 to show up in Mortal Kombat 1, but it's nice to see the team isn't limiting itself to picking from the old games only. There are still a few weeks between now and launch, which means there is still plenty of time for Meat and Mokap to get redemption. Three of my favorites are already confirmed (Smoke, Rain, Kenshi), but there are a few fighters who made their debut in Mortal Kombat X that I'd love to see make the cut too. Surely I'm not the only one who wants Erron Black back.\nMortal Kombat 1 is set to release on September 19 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC. As a reminder, the first Kombat Pack for the game has been revealed and will include returning Kombatants, as well as Peacemaker, Homelander, and Omni-Man.\nThe post Geras gears up for Mortal Kombat 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "More options are always a good thing, especially in the world of gaming, and particularly in regions that don't have many choices of where to buy the latest games and hardware. Thankfully, Nintendo just opened up their services in Australia.\nAs pointed out by Vooks.net, My Nintendo Australia storefront is now selling physical games (as well as hardware). Previously the system would just provide rewards and exclusives, but now you can shop with them directly. There's 46 games for sale at the time of publication, as well as multiple variations of the Switch (including the OLED and Tears of the Kingdom OLED), on top of Pro Controllers and Switch Lite models.\nVooks notes that this is also a big deal because Nintendo hasn't sold Australian customers games directly before. The only catch is that the minimum free shipping order has been bumped up from $80 to $100.\nMy Nintendo stores are actually pretty robust, so this is good news for Australia\nI don't know if you've ever looked at your respective My Nintendo storefront, but in some regions, it has a massive/surprising amount of inventory and SKUs. The US version has games, hardware, merch, and exclusives: they even sell accessories like the Pokemon Go Plus+ (ha, I still can't get used to this name).\nSome lines (like Pikmin) even have a full section, with multiple games and pieces of merch. It's not always the best option, but it's an option nonetheless that I use a few times a year.\nThe post My Nintendo Australia is selling physical games now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Larian Studios, developers of the long-awaited and just-long Baldur's Gate 3, have unveiled the trailer for the villainous Orin the Red. She's a master shapeshifter and one-third of a triumvirate of main villains that players will have to deal with in the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_nOikdM7oo\nOrin will create many challenges for players as she has the ability to shapeshift into any person in the world. This means we probably won't get the chance to trust any NPC we come across in the game, or perhaps even worse. It's likely that she will, at some point, replace one of our companions without us noticing, so keep an ever-watchful eye. Also, many call her a \"great master\" of murder, so she's perhaps also good at doing other even viler stuff.\nThe voice and motion behind Orin are those of Maggie Robertson. Most players will recognize her as Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village. She describes Orin as a \"very disturbing figure\". Joining Maggie to form the villainous trio will be J.K Simmons of Whiplash and Invincible fame, as well as Jason Isaacs from that thing with the kid wizard.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394178\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nSimmons will portray General Ketheric Thorm, a military leader who's seemingly unkillable.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOqD3uATwSc\nIsaacs will portray Lord Enver Gortash, a sleazy politician hellbent on conquering Baldur's Gate. He'll seemingly try to convince the main character to join forces with him on his quest. That's cool, but I'm guessing he doesn't have the best of intentions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUcZYW43_pQ\nWe can barely wait to kill the three of them.\nBaldur's Gate 3 will come out on August 3 on Steam and GOG. PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait until it releases on September 6. There's still no word on the Xbox Series X|S release.\nThe post Latest Baldur’s Gate 3 trailer shows Maggie Robertson’s villainous shapeshifter appeared first on Destructoid.",

I still play them with some regularity, but I just have a hard time falling into them and continuing after beating the arcade mode a couple of times.\n1997’s Bloody Roar was recommended to me a few times, but I only now got around to playing it.

The Sorcerer changes are pretty monumental, offering improved survivability and removing some of the unnecessary annoyances the class has.

The system delivers many of those features, though feats such as 8K gaming remain a dream. Nevertheless, the public has clearly warmed to the PS5, and it is already celebrating 40 million units sold globally.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394087\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nA new milestone for the PS5\nThe PS5 initially launched at a bit of a tumultuous time. On one hand, the console may have benefited from COVID-19 quarantining which kept people at home. However, it also had to contend with the global microchip shortage which kept supply of the system well below demand.\nDespite the obstacles, Sony has managed to sell over 40 million PS5s globally. To put things into perspective, the PS4 took 30 months to sell 40 million units after it launched in November 2013. The PS5 has achieved the feat in 32 months, which is about the same time.\nThe console sits ahead of classics such as the Xbox and GameCube, which both sold around 21 million units in their lifetimes. However, it still has a long way to go if it wants to surpass the PS4's 114 million units sold, the Switch with its incredible 125 million units, or the indomitable PS2 which has sold 159 million units worldwide.\nThis year, Sony has been keeping the console relevant with new peripheral hardware. The PS VR2 was released in February, and its library features titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Pavlov VR. Sony also plans to release the handheld streaming device codenamed Q, though time will tell how the public receives the curious gadget.\nThe post PlayStation 5 has sold over 40 million units appeared first on Destructoid.",

The adorable plant creatures are back, and this time they are joined by Oatchi the lovable rescue pup. Though the series has struggled a bit in the past, Pikmin 4 has made quite a splash since its launch, managing to reach the top of the Japan sales charts.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394079\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nPikmin 4 has a successful launch\nAs revealed by Gemastu, Pikmin 4 has sold 401,853 physical copies in its first week. This strong opening surpasses the first-week sales of all three prior games combined. Nintendo has been doing a great job of keeping players Pikmin-crazy all year, as the Pikmin 1+2 bundle was made available on the Switch in June.\nWith Pikmin 4 at the number one spot, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom slides to second place on the Japan sales charts after several weeks at the top. Despite this, Link’s latest adventure still manages to sell exceedingly well, with 15,616 physical copies sold in Japan between July 17 and 23. This brings up the lifetime physical sales in Japan to 1,775,035.\nFor context, you can find the complete list below. Lifetime sales in brackets if applicable:\n1: Pikmin 4 (Switch) – 401,853\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch) – 15,616 (1,775,035)\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe (Switch) - 10,749 (5,385,022)\nNobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening (Switch) - 10,633\nNobunaga’s Ambition: Awakening (PS4) - 10,434\nMinecraft (Switch) - 7,512 (3,200,000)\nSplatoon 3 (Switch) - 6,337 (4,066,350)\nNintendo Switch Sports (Switch) - 5,784 (1,131,645)\nFinal Fantasy 16 (PS5) - 4,904 (401,376)\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate (Switch) - 4,844 (5,239,500)\nAs usual, the Nintendo Switch dominates the sales charts.

You can nab it on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.\nMega City Police is really nostalgic for the ‘80s. You play as legally distinct versions of various action heroes and dole out justice from the end of their guns. Every scene in the trailer is depicted under a CRT filter, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\nhttps://youtu.be/lsYhwmKWqXo\nMega City Police comes touting eight playable characters with 16 different abilities. More impressively, it has more than 100 weapons and upgrades! I’m not sure if that is “100 weapons including upgrades” or “100 weapons that you can upgrade.” This is played underneath the pulsing tones of a synth-wave soundtrack. It’s also a roguelite, which I know means that half of you stopped reading. For those of you that remain, the levels are procedurally assembled, and there’s “a robust progression system.”\nI can dig its vibes. I like dual-stick shooters and synth-wave. However, what really stands out to me in the trailer is the character selection screen. I just want to hang around in that police station. Those donuts look great.\nMega City Police is available today on Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

Using all the screenshots, teasers, and any other information that's out there, fans have managed to piece together a detailed map of this unreleased title, which includes a 1,000-page compendium.\nStarfield fans are thorough, is the long and the short of it. But someone has recently discovered that the RPG may not be the perfect culmination of years of development after all, as it turns out there's a very small spelling error.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/15aqomq/starfield_state_of_the_at/\nIn a post over on Reddit, user Ambitious_Back4748 has uploaded a screenshot from Starfield which shows a close-up of a pretty meaty gun. However, one particular aspect of this weapon has been circled. When the image is zoomed in, you can see the words \"State of the at Weapon Frame.\" Presumably, this should read \"State of the art.\"\nCancel your pre-orders, everyone!\nIt's a very tiny error, but it's just one more proof that dedicated gamers pay a lot of attention to marketing material. If you want to check out which bit this very specific screenshot is from, you can watch the Starfield Direct video, which went live a month ago.\nYou still need to be pretty quick on the pause button, though. The actual close-up of the gun happens for barely a second at around the 39:12 mark. Seriously, it's one that can be so easily missed, it's a wonder anyone spotted it at all.\nWhether Bethesda will rectify this spelling mistake or not remains to be seen. Still, it's not as if it's going to tarnish the already immense hype surrounding one of the biggest releases of this generation. Gamers aren't that finicky, right?\nStarfield will be launching on September 6 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Starfield has a tiny spelling error, spotted by an eagle-eyed fan appeared first on Destructoid.",

The original character roster and stages are returning, and they've all gone through a mega glow-up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDlOIc9HsyA\nWhat's new in the All-Star Brawl?\nThere's also going to be a lot of new stuff. Expect new characters, mini-games, and even a whole new single-player campaign. Both Squidward and Jimmy Neutron are confirmed for the roster this time around, too.\nIn the campaign, players will be up against Vlad Plasmius of Danny Phantom fame as he tries to conquer the whole universe. The daunting task will hopefully turn easier with the addition of new \"Supers\", which similar to the \"Final Smash\" moves from Super Smash Bros., are ultimate moves meant to get rid of your foes in epic fashion.\nThe new minigames are Pinch the Blimps, Whack-a-Bot, and Irken Armada Bootcamp Survival. We still don't know what their gameplay will be like exactly. We do know, however, that you can play them either with friends or by yourself against the world as you strive to get to the top of the global leaderboard.\nAll characters in All-Star Brawl 2 will now have voices, which is nice, as the first game received criticism for its lack of voices. All-Star Brawl 2 will feature talent like Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke from SpongeBob SquarePants.\nAll-Star Brawl 2 comes out later this year.

Rather than endanger lives by performing surgery with undertrained staff, Two Point Campus has you setting youthful education seekers up for life by saddling them with insurmountable debt. You do so by putting them through wacky courses to polish up their culinary and archeology skills.\nThe sale on Two Point Campus isn’t just for the PC version. The PlayStation (August 2-16) and Xbox (now until August 7) ports are also getting discounted 50%. No word on the Switch. The two DLC expansions are also on sale and can be bought in a bundle.\nIt’s well worth it. Not only did I give it high marks in my review of it last year, but I also selected it for a place on my prestigious Top 10 Picks of 2022 list. Every time a new DLC pack drops, I eagerly pick it up again. Something about the weird Two Point universe of daft, hapless puppet-people keeps me coming back.

          "description": "Devolver Digital has announced that The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood will come out on August 16. This is the new game by Deconstructeam, the studio behind hits such as Gods Will Be Watching and The Red Strings Club, so expectations are set for another narrative hit.\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1684217007456280576?s=20\nBut what is The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood?\nThe beginning of the trailer is reminiscientof a kind of magical realism we see in games such as Kentucky Route Zero. Still, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood doesn't waste time revealing that it'll be even more magical than expected.\nIt tells the story of Fortuna, a witch who lived in exile on an asteroid until she made a pact with some sort of space devil to gain back her freedom. She then reunites with her coven on Earth and goes on a mystical journey through space and time, where she'll come to terms with her abilities and responsibilities.\nThe Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is a narrative adventure. It'll put a lot of emphasis on the journey and relationships with Fortuna's coven and with the friends she'll make along the way, but it will also feature more technical gameplay elements.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393923\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image by Devolver Digital[/caption]\nGods Will Be Witching\nFortuna is an arcane witch. She can craft special tarot-like cards that will grant her the ability to revisit the past and foresee various possible futures for the people she meets. This mechanic will invite us to have a positive impact on the lives of every character she comes in contact with. Will we make things better?\nIt seems like we might be looking at one of those games that you'll have to replay a few times to finally get that perfect ending, and that's great.\nThe Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood will release on Nintendo Switch and PC on August 16. Pre-ordering it on Steam will get you 10% off.\nThe post The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood arrives in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nPart 5\nPart 6\nPart 7\nPart 8\nPart 9\nPart 10\nPart 11\nPart 12\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. \nThis means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. \nFor more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \nAre you going to be checking out Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox Series X/S?

Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. \n“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”\nFor more about Dawntrail, head to Game Informer's story featuring everything you need to know about the expansion. \nStory in development...\nWhat do you think of the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail trailer?

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. \nSony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. \n\n\nThat’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.\nHowever, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.\n\n\nSEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it: \n\n\nFor more, read Game Informer’s PlayStation 5 review to find out why we love the console, and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 best PS5 games after that. \nDo you have a PS5?

With today’s launch day discount on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase The Entropy Centre for $12.49. \nCheck out the Nintendo Switch launch trailer for The Entropy Centre below: \n\n\nThe Switch version of The Entropy Centre arrives less than a year after the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions launched last November. In the game, players take on the role of protagonist Aria, who awakens inside a colossal space station just outside of a constantly exploding Earth. It’s up to you to figure out why this space station – The Entropy Centre – has been abandoned, why Earth keeps exploding, and why your day resets afterward. You’ll do all this alongside Astra, a talking gun with a great sense of humor. \nFor more about the game, watch this gameplay trailer and then read Game Informer’s review of The Entropy Centre. \nHave you played The Entropy Centre?

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. \nAs was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.\nThe Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.\nTo see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.",

          "description": "Sea of Stars is one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year and even graced Game Informer’s cover back in March. While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.\nA PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. \nSea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  \nSea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game. We also have a video interview with creative director Thierry Boulanger breaking down Sea of Stars’ RPG inspirations.",

He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nThis is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others. \n For more on Techland, you can check out this piece of concept art from their new fantasy IP as well as our Dying Light 2 Stay Human review.",

To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. \nDespite the \"VI\" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or \"Raven\" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. \n\n\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.\nThe five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.\n\n\nThe video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. \nAtlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. \nEnjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nUbisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. \nIn our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. \nFor more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. \nThe Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.\nAre you excited for The Crew Motorfest?

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.
