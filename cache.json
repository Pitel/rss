But apart from ruining selfies, increasing sprint speeds and granting long jump abilities, we hadn't seen one that actually bypasses the games' story... until now, that is.\nAs pointed out by u/GalaxyHunter17 on Reddit, there is a certain loophole in the game which, should you follow it, lets you can skip the first day of school and seemingly the start of the story too. The glitch itself relatively spoiler-free, though there are some locations and description of where the game's tutorial will take you in the following details.

This officially-licensed accessory allowed you to interact with the game even when your phone was in your pocket; a flashing LED button on the device would alert you to nearby Pokéstops and Pokémon, and a quick press would initiate either a spin or a catch attempt.\nNintendo replaced the Go Plus with the Poké Ball Plus (which could also be used in Pokémon GO Let's Go), but since then, the company hasn't expanded on this concept – leaving third-party accessory makers to fight one another to create the ultimate Pokémon GO companion device.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This happens everywhere: Fashion, movies, makeup, and even language tend to rely on this ever-revolving cycle of nostalgia, fuelled by a yearning for the childhood memories of whoever happens to be in charge.\nVideo games, despite being a relatively new medium, are not exempt from this — although the exact games and aesthetics that we are nostalgic for vary from person to person. You can feel the nostalgia seeping through the screen in games like Lucas Pope's early Mac-inspired 1-bit game Return of the Obra Dinn, or La-Mulana's imitation of old MSX visuals. And now, in a twist of the knife for anyone over 30, the nostalgia cycle has hit the DS game era, in the gorgeously chunky outlines and delicious dithering of upcoming Switch game, Demonschool.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s a 12-player crazy golf game that dials up the crazy, and as we soon found back in those pre-vaccine days, one that reaches a whole other level of club-and-ball chaos with a single settings tweak.\r\n\n\r\nSee, with ball collision switched off, Golf With Your Friends is pretty fun. The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn. All fine and dandy. Turn ball collision on, however, and it becomes outright pandemonium. \r\n\n \nRead more",

These controllers normally retail £54.99, making this a solid £25 discount! \nThis is one of the best early Black Friday PC deals we've spotted so far, and well worth picking up for games that benefit from controller input, like those in the racing, platformer, action and fighting genres. Of course, it's also an essential pickup if you like playing around with emulators, and of course works on two generations of Xbox consoles as well. \nRead more",

Season 2’s battle pass, on the other hand, requires a total of 87,450 XP.

It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I'd call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier's Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4.

I'm saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.\nSpider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac's first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It's a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it's still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it's shorter.\nRead more",

Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto's seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. \nIn it, you play as Princess Euphora, who's on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It's not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I've seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya.

Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. 'Aha!' I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.\nFor those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.\nRead more",

The Banished Vault is the first game on the new indie publishing label of Bithell Games, but more interesting to me is that it's coming from the designer of Sun Dogs.\nRead more",

We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.\r\n\n\r\nStill, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I store things using a cunning system of my own devising i.e. the cellotape has been behind the left monitor on my desk for months, so by the transitive property that is now Where The Cellotape Goes. If I put the cellotape somewhere more logical, like in a drawer for keeping things like cellotape, then I would forget where the cellotape is. \nThe area in and around my desk is a nonsensical melange of things, a place that would probably deal you +12 psychological damage if you approached without the necessary preparation.

Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.\nLikewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.\nRead more",

It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. \nIts captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.\nRead more",

While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.\nSomerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.\nRead more",

I feel that's a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive's suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.\n\nGet the Crucial BX500 1TB for £56 (RRP £74)\n\nRead more",

This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF. \nRead more",

Even the 32-core high frequency Genoa performance has been dominating against Intel's current Xeon Scalable competition. While AMD EPYC Genoa brings very impressive gains generation-over-generation and against the current Xeon Ice Lake CPUs, curiosity got the best of me for seeing how the new AMD EPYC CPUs compare to AMD's original EPYC 1st Gen \"Naples\" flagship - the EPYC 7601 2P.

Superliminal's \"kick\" lies in the concept of optical illusions, and tasks the player with escaping a series of chambers utilizing elements of forced perspective, object scaling, and the manipulation of the third dimension in order to craft a path to the exit.\nBetter demonstrated than explained, you can check out the action in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KY87ldajFY\nThe new PS5/Xbox Series X port of Superliminal supports 4K resolution with a framerate of 60 frames per second. In addition, the ports receive the recently patched \"Developer mode\", which includes commentary from the team at Pillow Castle, and \"Challenge Mode\", which limits the number of movements that the player is allowed to perform in each chamber, requiring a little more forethought before attempting each topsy-turvy situation. Best of all, these new editions are now available as free upgrades for all players who already own Superliminal on PS4 and Xbox One respectively.\nNow go get your brain melted.\nSuperliminal is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Smart puzzler Superliminal now available on PS5 and Xbox Series X appeared first on Destructoid.",

A translation from Ruliweb suggests that Yasuda said news of these projects would arrive \"as soon as possible\".\nThe last mainline Ninja Gaiden release was 2012's Ninja Gaiden 3, …",

This time Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is getting an expected physical item release, and it actually entails two things.\nHere's all we know at the moment:\n\"Two new rewards - Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet partner pokemon mini-notebook and Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet violet highlighter with case are coming. Stay tuned for more info.\"\n\nThe notebook is adorned with iconography of the new generational starters, and the highlighter set is themed after the two legendaries (and the coloring of Scarlet and Violet itself). It's hard to say what point value these could clock in at when they hit the system, but count on at least 500 Platinum Points per item.\nAlso, it's very important to note that nearly all Pokemon items (even the crossover keychain with Splatoon 3) \"sell out\" of My Nintendo stock shortly after they launch. Make sure you have the points for the one(s) you want!\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "100% Less Twisted\nYou think Hamster has already hit all of the shmups released in the late '80s/early '90s? Well, think again, buster, as the retro lovin' publisher has added Taito's eye-searing shooter Metal Black to its mammoth Arcade Archives range, with the forgotten shmup now available to purchase on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1991, during Taito's \"Loud & Vulgar\" phase, (see also: Under Fire, Special Criminal Investigation), Metal Black is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shmup set against the backdrop of a damaged Earth, having fallen victim to a devastating meteor shower. In the aftermath of this event, an alien force attacks the weakened planet, leading to the surrender of humanity. However, one rogue pilot, John Ford, refuses to allow mankind to go quietly into the night. Hijacking prototype vessel \"CF-345 Black Fly\", Ford embarks on a final bid to send the unwelcome visitors packing.\nYou can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber AL82 Retrogaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB4mS79R0DI\nMetal Black consists of six stages of frenetic sky-fighting action, with mechanics not dissimilar to that of Irem's R-Type and Taito's own Darius franchise. As previously noted, Metal Black comes from an era of Taito that features somewhat ugly textures, slapdash scaling, and some brutal visual effects, which often renders the in-game action a little tough to follow. Regardless, this forgotten example does feature a pretty rad soundtrack, interesting boss designs, and a novel feature that sees the story come to one of two massively different conclusions, dependent on how the player fares on the final encounter.\nMetal Black is available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch now.\nThe post Taito’s dystopian shmup Metal Black hits the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players ranked S+0 or higher can get in on some action that is decidedly NOT chill. You'll have to put your own X Power on the line to take part, but don't worry—Anarchy Battles will still be available as well. If you do decide to take the plunge into X Battles, you'll need to join one of two divisions sponsored by local gear brands. The Takoroka Division covers Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, while the Americas and Europe play in the Tentatek Division.\"\n\nIn short, X Battles are an additional thing (and currently the highest tier possible) for competitive players to jump into. But it's very important to note that even if you've raised your rank to the point where you've unlocked X Battles, Anarchy Battles will still be available on a separate tier. So even if you end up not liking it, you can just trade back down.\nI also highly suspect that X Battles are going to be getting a number of tweaks going forward, just like nearly every other mode in the game so far.\nThe post Nintendo gives us more details on Splatoon 3’s upcoming X Battles system appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, it's a snug suggestion that console players will be joining the war effort sooner rather than later, and most assuredly in 2023.\nThe newest entry in the acclaimed strategy series, Company of Heroes 3 will task armchair generals with guiding their highly trained platoons through the North African theater of war. The sequel boasts a new \"dynamic\" campaign mode, that will adjust itself for multiple playthroughs with a sandbox approach to its tactical action. The \"Essence\" engine will bring levels of environmental destructibility yet to be experienced in the series, while a battalion of new units and vehicles will be sure to keep fans grinding out epic battle into the midnight hour and beyond.\nWe will be sure to let you know should official word of the console ports be forthcoming.\nCompany of Heroes 3 launches February 23 on PC via Steam.\nThe post Company of Heroes 3 rated for PS5 and Xbox Series X in Taiwan appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Y'all here for Prehistory Rogue?\nNetflix has released a fun new trailer for its upcoming animated series Sonic Prime — And this particular preview has more than a hint of Multiverse Madness about it, as The Blue Blur finds himself hopping through time and space to confront wild variants of his friends, enemies, and worlds.\nOver the course of the two-minute preview Sonic blasts through past and future universes, each filled with its own unique hazards and dangers. But the real meat of the clip comes from the cool array of alternate pals that appear in the mix, from cybernetic versions of Tails and Amy Rose, to special forces variants of Knuckles and Rogue, and no less than five different Dr. Robotniks. My favorite is Prehistory Rogue, who confronts our hero accompanied by your favorite, Big the Cat.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rShZls4Ffw\nProduced by Canadian Studio WildBrain (Carmen Sandiego, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) and American producer Man of Action (Ultimate Spider-Man, Mega Man: Fully Charged), Sonic Prime promises 24 episodes of Gotta Go Fast action, featuring all of the characters both recognizable, (and, apparently, unrecognizable), from Sega's smash-hit video game franchise. Our lad Sonic has frequently proved himself a snug fit for animated antics, and hopefully, this new show will be no different.\nSonic Prime premieres exclusively on Netflix on December 15. Back in the digital world, Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post New Sonic Prime trailer takes a trip through time and space appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even if you don’t count any spinoff titles and lump all dual releases together (ie Red and Blue), you still have over 20 games to choose from. If you can’t count the entries in a series on your fingers and toes, there are officially too many for a new person to consider.\nFortunately, the Pokémon formula is so timeless that virtually every mainline game is a good starting point. That said, the series has plenty of peaks and valleys, and some of those peaks are truly spectacular.

Boasting an original storyline set after the events of Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Squadrons puts players in dual roles as members of both The New Republic and The Galactic Empire, both of which are tasked with the creation or destruction of a devastating new vessel known as Project Starhawk.\nStar Wars Squadrons features a full story campaign as well as several multiple modes, and allows players to pilot an array of famous ships such as the X-Wing, the B-Wing, the TIE Fighter, and the TIE Bomber. Stars Wars Squadrons received moderate praise for its visuals and authenticity to the Star Wars universe, though some lauded the title's unfulfilling \"work against yourself\" story mode, as well as a general lack of content.\nStar Wars Squadrons is available to download from Epic Games Store on November 24. Until then, users can still bag themselves current freebies Evil Dead: The Game and Dark Deity.\nThe post Star Wars Squadrons is the next Epic Games Store freebie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Among the musicians featured in the new release are GoSatoBan, Heavy Metal Raiden, Fantom Iris, O.T.K., Soshi Hosoi, Daisuke Matsumoto, Cosio, Keishi Yonao, Ryu☆, Raito, and Yu Shimoda — performing a total of 20 new stage and boss battle themes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XePNRdq_bZs&t\nAway from the block-rockin' beats, the remix includes several new features including monitor orientation options, online rankings, and the ability to upload your latest run to an online server, for viewing by the Raiden community.

The sale will end November 28.]\nThe dedicated king of PlayStation Plus leaks, Dealabs author billbil-kun, has suggested that the black-and-blue brand is preparing to offer a meaty 25% discount on its range of PS Plus paid subscription services — The discount is expected to arrive as part of the forthcoming Black Friday madness.\nAccording to the veteran PS leaker, PlayStation users will be able to pick up 12-month PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscriptions at a quarter of their original price, provided that they are bagged between November 18-28. As a quick refresher, Essential offers monthly free titles and online capabilities, Extra throws in access to a catalog of rotating titles, while Premium users also receive access to the PlayStation Classics range, as well as exclusive demos and trials.\nWith a 25% discount included, PlayStation owners can expect the following prices in the rumored offer:\nPlayStation Plus Essential (12 Month) - $44.99 / €44.99 / £37.49\nPlayStation Plus Extra (12 Month) – $74.99 / €74.99 / £62.99\nPlayStation Plus Premium (12 Month) – $89.99 / €89.99 / £74.99\nAdmittedly, in financially tough times such as these, 80 buckeroos for a gaming subscription is still a pretty hefty ask. But if you're the type of player to burn through games with reckless abandon, then having access to a constantly rotating catalog of releases across 2023 will, ultimately, pay for itself.\nOf course, there is no official word the deal is definitely happening. But, given Dealabs consistent accuracy when revealing PlayStation Plus titles, this Black Friday discount rumor can probably be filed under \"concrete\".\nThe post PlayStation Plus to receive 25% discount for Black Friday (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, you'll have to hold off on that! That functionality isn't coming until roughly mid-2023.\nHere's the full confirmation of when Scarlet and Violet are getting Home support\nSo over on the game's official site, The Pokemon Company says that support will be coming \"in spring 2023.\" It's important to remember that this will only include \"select Pokemon from past games\" as well. Here's the disclaimer: \"Note: The Pokemon you’ll be able transfer to each game via Pokemon HOME are limited to Pokemon that can appear in those games. Please look out for more information about which Pokemon will be available in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet.\"\nBefore then, there is something coming sooner. That same post explains that in \"early 2023,\" the pair of games are getting \"Battle Stadium statistics\" support: \"From the app, you’ll be able to view information about Trainer rankings, frequently used Pokémon, Online Competitions, and more. You’ll also be able to see what moves, Abilities, and held items are being used in battles the most.\"\nIt's unfortunate that the rollout is so far away, but it also allows for some time for the current generation to marinate and sink in, without tons of different metas emerging.

As Princess Euphora watches the evil general annihilate the fleet, the crew jets off into space, seeking salvation at the Forever Star with a plucky crew, hanging by a thread.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mitPu7bcDB8\nIf you're reminded of the days of '70s anime, that's not an accident. League of Geeks specifically cites Star Blazers, the animated adaptation of anime series Space Battleship Yamato, as an inspiration. And according to the Steam page, there may be some smooth '70s Tokyo disco in the mix, too.\nFly me to the moon\nWhile the trailer gives a good look at the style, inspiration, and setting for this adventure, the Steam page holds some more info on the actual gameplay of this \"FTL-meets-Star Blazers\" hybrid.\nAs the captain escaping the warmongering Zutopans, you'll have to keep the starship running while making your way to the Forever Star. This means managing needs, repairing damage, and keeping an eye on those aboard the ship.\n\nCrewmates can act out a sort of \"floating melodrama\" thanks to their moods, allowing relationships and incidents to arise. Keep Hope alive, literally, and it'll keep your boat afloat.\nDifferent biomes and hazards, emergent disasters, and hostile ships all act to keep you from your goal. But this seems like a cool mix of spaceship sim and management, with an infectious nostalgia for the classics. Alongside League of Geeks' other project, a remake of Solium Infernum, the team is putting together some great-looking throwbacks. Here's hoping they both stick the landing next year.\nThe post Jumplight Odyssey is a blend of spaceship management and classic anime appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a must-play if you like story-driven games or point and click adventures, and it's honestly a crime that it wasn't nominated for Best Narrative at the Game Awards, because the writing is absolutely gorgeous. NORCO has been out since March, but the game's developer Geography of Robots just announced today via Twitter that the southern gothic adventure is now available to play on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.\nNaturally, the game's controls were entirely reworked for controller instead of mouse and keyboard, and the devs also confirmed in the Twitter thread that the PC version of the game also has controller support now. They even included a helpful graphic that breaks down how the control scheme will work on a PlayStation Dualshock. Basically, you can either use the left stick as a virtual mouse, or simply use the D-pad to select \"hotspots or other UI elements.\" Big win for controller simps like me.\nhttps://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1593265507939098625\nFor those who may not know what to expect from NORCO's gameplay, Geography of Robots describes it pretty well in yet another tweet:\n\"Gameplay-wise, it resembles classic first-person text-based pixel adventures like Snatcher, Deja Vu, Policenauts, VA-11 HA-11 A, Read Only Memories, Circuit's Edge, Rise of the Dragon, etc. There are also combat minigames. You can automate them if you want.\"\nNORCO is one of those games that I enjoyed so much that I want to buy it on another platform, and I have to admit I'm enticed by the idea of playing it on a bigger screen. Regardless of any awards, it's one of the most stylish, thoughtful indie games of recent memory, and I think in the long run, it'll stick around.\nThe post Best Narrative snub NORCO is now available for consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Speed Demons\nAtlus has released a brand new update for its stylish Shin Megami Tensei spin-off, Soul Hackers 2 — Now available to download on all platforms, the new patch adds four new demons to the mix, and includes several new abilities to help slim down that all-consuming time-grind.\nThe new \"Dash\" toggle will although players to control Ringo at a much-accelerated rate, helping her to negotiate the monster-infested labyrinths with speed, and even performing her standard \"slash\" in double-quick time. This new speed increase can also be applied to battles themselves, with a \"Speed Up\" toggle allowing for quick and easy carvings in face-to-face encounters. Hopefully, these two new additions will make grinding for XP less of a chore.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5GhQxUiVg\nFour new demons have been added to the Soul Hackers 2 roster via this new update. The demons are the fiery Aitvaras, the stoic priestess Isis, the frankly bizarre Neko Shotgun, and the hyper-iconic Pixie — depicted in her original Devil Summoner form. It should be noted that acquiring these new demons does not count toward the in-game Registration Percentage of the Demon Compendium, nor its associated achievements or trophies.\nFinally, a small run of tweaks and bug fixes should improve loading times across the board, while other changes streamline the shop experience, and include new preventative measures to stop button mashers from accidentally selecting the wrong options while plowing through the game's many menu screens. Huh, an update that asks you to take your time AND speed up.\nSoul Hackers 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Soul Hackers 2 1.02 update adds new demons and speedy mechanics appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

          "description": "Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1.

While we would love to be one of those reviews, we're not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I've finished most of the main story, but I haven't fully explored the end and post-game content. \nHowever, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review.

The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. \nFor fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.\nPlayers represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.\n\n\nSince the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",
