With the release of PO’ed: Definitive Edition earlier this year, it was a clear-cut signal that the team is ready and willing to embrace titles that may not be the most recognisable in an increasingly crowded market, but nevertheless represent and preserve them, unearthing titles that would otherwise have fallen ever further into obscurity.\nKilling Time: Resurrected, originally developed by Studio 3DO and released in 1995, is another example of Nightdive’s valiant endeavour to spruce up curios, and from a technical point of view at least, it’s one of the studio’s most impressive efforts yet. Its presentation has been greatly enhanced while still retaining everything that made this 3DO FPS so unique, resulting in a product that frankly makes the original release borderline obsolete.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Everyone's entitled to one good scare.\nThe Halloween franchise is a complicated beast. You’ve got the original timeline, the Thorn timeline, the H20 timeline, the Blumhouse timeline, the Rob Zombie remakes and, finally, the adorably weird loner that is Season of the Witch. It’s all a bit overwhelming at the best of times, so thankfully, RetroRealms: Halloween strips away all of the nonsense and gets down to what fans love best: serial killer Michael Myers embarking on a vicious, knife-wielding rampage.\nThe best part is that you get to play as Myers himself stalking through a series of levels inspired by the film series, most notably the 1978 original. Naturally, it would be a bit harsh for every ‘enemy’ in the game to be innocent babysitters and their woefully gullible partners (though there are a few), so instead you're dealing with similarly deranged killers to appease a demonic overlord that gifts Myers the ability to shift over into the Dark Realm.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Groovy.\nGiven the sheer absurdity of the Evil Dead franchise, it’s a wonder we haven’t received anything quite like RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead in the past. Yes, there have been a handful of video games featuring everyone’s favourite boomstick-wielding drunkard Ash Williams, but this latest effort from developer WayForward and publisher Boss Team Games is arguably the best yet. It takes the setting of the Ash vs Evil Dead TV series and combines it with razor-sharp gameplay, gorgeous pixel-art visuals, and a hub area that will delight dedicated fans of the horror genre.\nWhile there is a vague plot with Ash vs Evil Dead, it’s more concerned with capturing the essence of the franchise with its gameplay and visuals. After all, if simply eviscerating hordes of Deadites with a chainsaw and shotgun feels fun and keeps you playing, then that’s really all that matters. And make no mistake, it is very fun.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing.

I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.\nRead more",

You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and Steam. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I will not lie to you, gentle reader. When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.\r\n \nRead more",

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.\nSpeaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have \"higher expectations\" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

          "description": "A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

          "description": "For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.\nIn which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.\nRead more",

          "description": "The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably \"Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.\nThere's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. \n Read more",

Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US.

          "description": "Goku Black's Sins, Gods and Punishment can be considered one of the hardest Battle Episode stages in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, as it tasks you with taking a Final Hope Slash (Future Trunks's Ultimate Blast) following a battle against Vegito Blue.\n\n\nBut as defeating Vegito forcibly ends the stage and unlocks a branching path, how can you make Trunks join the fray and perform his trump card? Here's how to take a Final Hope Slash and unlock the true ending of Goku Black's story in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.\n\n\nHow to take a Final Hope Slash in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero\n\n\nYou can take a Final Hope Slash during Sins, Gods and Punishment in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero by surviving the fight against Vegito until Zamasu says \"A perfect and pure multiverse made clean by Zamasu's hand!\". That will prompt Trunks to take the stage and perform the move after entering Sparking Mode.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nFor an exact time frame, I had to keep up with Vegito for two minutes until the line was delivered. Keep in mind that it is also possible for Trunks to either join the fray a little early or several seconds after the set time. The same can be said for the timing of his Final Hope Slash, so make sure to stay sharp.\n\n\nHow to Survive against Vegito in Sins, Gods and Punishment \n\n\nIf you are having trouble keeping Vegito in a stalemate given his constant use of High-Speed Evasions, counters, and Ultimate Blast combos, you can do so by staying away from him while circling the area with consecutive Dragon Dashes. You can perform a Dragon Dash in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero by holding R2/RT and X/A while tilting your right analog stick in any direction. \n\n\nWhen doing the above, make sure not to double-tap X/A, as doing so will force you to perform a Z-Burst Dash and fly toward Vegito's back. \n\nThe post How to Take a Final Hope Slash in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero: Sins, Gods and Punishment Guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

But what if the tables were somewhat turned? What if you were the one being pursued by someone with an unquenchable thirst for retaliation?\n\n\nThat's what modder Craftian has done. See, when Benny and the Great Khans buried the Courier right at the start of New Vegas, they didn't factor in disturbing the grave of another being. \"Then Came the Stranger\" is a mod in which an enemy known simply as The Stranger pursues the player at every turn.\n\n\nImage via Craftian/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nMuch like the Terminator – whose only goal is to kill John Connor and prevent the future war – this new Fallout adversary absolutely will not stop until it's ended the player. \"Well, I'll simply kill this Stranger, then. I have all the weapons in the world,\" you say in response.\n\n\nYeah, about that...\n\n\nAs it turns out, The Stranger is not one who is going to give up easily. As the modder themselves says:\n\n\n\nShould you succeed and defeat them, however, know that victory is\nonly temporary. The Stranger will rise again and the hunt begins anew.\n\n\n\n\nCraftian also refers to it as a \"Nemesis\" hunter, indicating a decent amount of inspiration from Resident Evil 3, which also sees its main protagonist being mercilessly pursued by an unstoppable bully. Though in this instance, I don't think The Stranger can mutate.\n\n\nI do quite like the idea of a Fallout: New Vegas double cat 'n' mouse game, in which the Courier is chasing after Benny, while also being on the end of a hunter themselves.\n\nThe post Fallout: New Vegas mod adds in an unstoppable Nemesis-like foe that pursues the player appeared first on Destructoid.",

Naturally, Bandai Namco took this as an opportunity to add its characters to more than one Dragon Ball video game.\n\n\nFirstly, there's the recently released 3D arena fighter, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO. Bandai Namco had already announced that Goku (Mini) is going to be added to the roster a few weeks ago, but now the company posted a new trailer regarding the contents of the second DLC in the game's Season Pass.\n\n\n\n\nThis will add two fighters from Dragon Ball DAIMA to the game: Vegeta (Mini) and Glorio, the new character who made his debut in the first episode of the show.

After many years, fans of this classic can re-experience it on their Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nNintendo recently posted a trailer that confirms the addition of Banjo-Tooie to the Nintendo 64 catalog of its Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service next week, on October 25. This was long overdue, because Banjo-Kazooie has been available on the service since 2022.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the most interesting aspect of this new version of Banjo-Tooie is the addition of widescreen mode, something that is not quite common on Nintendo Switch Online releases.

You cannot get this item as a by-product of any kind of production, though it is very easy to make. So here's how to get Leftovers in Once Human. \n\n\nHow to get Leftovers in Once Human\n\n\nYou can find Leftovers in hostile settlements, but I definitely don't recommend farming it like that. The most efficient way to get them is by hunting animals – any will do. \n\n\nNear the starting town of Whalebone is a great hunting ground filled with Reindeer, Buffalo (really more of a Bison), and even Pigs. Take down whatever you wish, and make sure to skin the animal to acquire their hide. \n\n\nOnce you've got a decent amount of hide, open your Memetics screen and look for \"Leatherworking\" in the Crafting Memetics Menu (it's right at the top). Make sure you also unlock Essential Tools, which is right beside it. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNow, simply build a supplies bench of any level. Interact with it to start crafting, and you'll find the Leftovers item in the menu. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAnd that's all there is to it. I told you it was easy — you should now be able to make all the leftovers you need, but repairing your gear does use a lot. Be prepared to top up on Leftovers often.\n\n\nWhile you're here, have you figured out how to stay warm yet? Here's a guide on how to increase your cold resistance in The Way of Winter scenario in Once Human. \n\nThe post How to get Leftovers in Once Human appeared first on Destructoid.",
