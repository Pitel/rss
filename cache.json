Nintendo has dropped a brand new action-packed Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailer. We got a sneaky little look at the game over the weekend courtesy of an Amazon Japan listing, but this is the first big look since the game's reveal during the February 2022 Nintendo Direct.\nThis trailer is absolutely feeding Fire Emblem: Three Houses fans and finally gives us a proper look at our new protagonist, Shez. This purple-haired warrior - who you can choose to be male or female - seems much cockier and self-assured than Three Houses' Byleth. Given the trailer's name, 'Mysterious Mercenary', and Shez's declaration during the trailer that his \"pockets have been feeling awfully light, lately\", it sounds like they will be the titular mercenary. Though Three Houses fans will remember that Byleth and their mentor Geralt were also originally mercenaries.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Eventually most fascinating and fun games make their way around to Switch and other platforms, especially in the Indie space - now we can add former PlayStation / Epic Games exclusive Bugsnax to that list. It's confirmed for Switch and will be arriving, along with a free DLC expansion called The Isle of Bigsnax, on 28th April priced at $24.99USD.\nOne of the Indie highlights of the PS5 launch in late 2020 and included in PlayStation Plus for the new system (it arrived without inclusion in PS Plus on PS4, as well), it was a much talked about and streamed game at the time. It's the creation of Young Horses, the studio that first came to prominence with Octodad: Dadliest Catch. The hook in Bugsnax is that you're trying to capture an assortment of creatures that are (yep) walking snacks, with all sorts of quirky methods and requirements to do so. Its humour and creativity were certainly key contributors to its buzz.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One thing I've been playing recently is Ghostwire: Tokyo, a ghost huntin' action game that's a bit less weird and a bit more \"kind of like an Ubisoft game\" than I was expecting. But I like Ubisoft games just fine, so I'm having a blast - plus there are still some clutch ghost fights to be hand when I run out of finger-ammo for my magic hands.\nI am extra delighted by the animals, though. For whatever reason, they are unaffected by the evil fog that has swept through Tokyo and turned everyone into spirits, so there are a few dogs and cats just sitting around and (and this is the good bit) you can read their thoughts.\nRead more",

This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.\r\n\n\r\nIn a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.\nRead more",

Both are 1080p-focused cards on sale for £300 or less, both sit at the bottom of their respective GPU hierarchies (the RTX 30 series and Radeon RX 6000 series), and both support ray tracing, so let’s break out the bar chart app and do some comparisons. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. \nIndeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.\nRead more",

Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.\r\n\n\r\nAlas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.\nRead more",

It's a life sim set in a post apocalyptic world where, instead of punk metal bikinis and murder, the vibe is regrowth and bright colours; a sort of juicy 3D Stardew Valley with an emphasis on crafting. \nBut now the sequel My Time At Sandrock is launching into early access on May 26th, bringing a whole new region to restore. Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack. \nRead more",

This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.\nThis means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.\nRead more",

So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting.

          "description": "Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.\nI'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.\nRead more",

          "description": "Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.\r\n\n Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.\nNot content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members.

While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.\r\n\n\r\nUltimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full.

Now he’ll be penning the screenplay for Ghost of Tsushima’s big-screen adaptation, which is helmed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Alex Young and Jason Spitz of 87Eleven Entertainment serve as producers with PlayStation Productions overseeing the entire project. \nThe Ghost of Tsushima film is in very early development, with Stahlski saying in December that he intends to take his time with the movie in order to “do it right.” The film crew is said to be working closely with the game’s developer, Sucker Punch. Stahlski is a fan of Ghost and was inspired to make the movie after playing the game “many times.”\nWe still don’t know anything in regards to casting (though the voice actor for protagonist Jin Sakai raised his hand in humorous fashion) and it will likely be a while before we see anything substantial from the project. But it’s nice to see the pieces slowly fall into place. Video game movies have generally improved over the last few years, so we hope that Ghost of Tsushima continues the trend when it is eventually released.\n[Source: Deadline]",

          "description": "After a years-long wait, Stranger Things’ penultimate fourth season kicks off this summer. Releasing in two parts, the season's first full-length trailer sets the table for dangers new and old the heroes of Hawkins must contend with. \nThe story picks up several months after the events of 2019's Season 3. A powerless Eleven and the Byers family have moved to California. Hopper is being held captive in Russia. Our remaining friends must pick up the pieces while starting high school. Naturally, the ongoing supernatural menace and the sinister government conspiracy attached to it continue to haunt the world’s unluckiest small town. Per a warning to Eleven in the trailer: “a war is coming. Your friends in Hawkins are very much in the eye of a storm.”\nClick here to watch embedded media\nStranger Things 4 consists of nine episodes, each with a runtime twice as long as before. Because the episodes are supersized, they’ll be divided and released in two batches that are five weeks apart. Volume 1 premieres on May 27, and Volume 2 arrives on July 1. It's unknown how many episodes are in each volume, but one would imagine it's a clean split, so four/five each. \nEarlier this year, Netflix renewed Stranger Things for a 5th and final season. The last season currently has no premiere date. For more on Stranger Things, you can read about its recent crossovers with Far Cry 6 and Magic: The Gathering.",

This week we welcome our guest Bryan Vore back on the show as we take to the skies and explore the last game in this unfortunately short trilogy, Bioshock Infinite.\nBioshock Infinite started pre-production around the same time as Bioshock 2, but while 2K Marin was exploring the depths of the seas once again, Ken Levine and his team at 2K Boston/Irrational Games had their heads in the clouds. Focusing on American exceptionalism, Bioshock Infinite introduces players to the floating city of Columbia, an engineering feat inspired by the World's Fair attractions of yesteryear. We discuss the troubling development that miraculously came together late in the process as well as the main characters, Booker DeWitt and Bioshock's first constant companion in Elizabeth. And listen until the end as we reveal what's in store for the next season of Video Gameography!\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and former Game Informer Editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Bioshock released to date!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Instead of discouraging the filmmakers, the backlash motivated director Jeff Fowler and the rest of the team to pay more attention to the enthusiastic fan base.\n“They were absolutely right to request us to work harder and to make adjustments,” Fowler says. “And then to come out the other side and for everyone to be able to high five and celebrate, it felt like we ended in a place where they were happy, and the film was a film that they could embrace.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.\nWarning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, some aspects of the narrative and characters are mentioned thr…",
