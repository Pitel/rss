M2 revived Aleste, Platinum Games reanimated the Crestas, and now small indie outfit Picorinne Soft — comprised of brothers Ryo and Satto — has ventured a sequel to Visco’s Andro Dunos, a largely forgotten, Hellfire-inspired Neo Geo shoot-em-up from 1992.\nDespite stellar work, Picorinne Soft’s Steam, Dreamcast, and recent ex-A Arcadia releases remain relatively underground. While Andro Dunos II carries over its forebear’s ship and Hellfire-style weapon system, everything else is so vastly improved and expanded upon, that it bears only scant resemblance to the original game. It’s so different, in fact, that Visco’s IP seems like little more than a Trojan horse to gain them wider recognition.

The Cub tells the tale of a young boy who, alone on a desolate version of Earth, must escape the clutches of the humans who have long since escaped to Mars.\nIts gameplay reminds us a lot of PlayDead's INSIDE (albeit with a slightly rosier aesthetic), with a sharp focus on platforming and avoiding creatures and obstacles.

          "description": "A truly stunning homage.\nIf you haven't tried the wonderful Zelda-like adventure game Tunic yet, we highly recommend giving it a shot if you've got access to a decent PC or an Xbox. Our friends over at PureXbox reviewed it and gave it a 9/10, calling it a \"fantastically clever adventure that kicks off in familiar Zelda-esque fashion before branching out to become its own thing entirely\".\nIt's no secret that developer Andrew Shouldice took a great deal of inspiration from the Zelda franchise during the making of the game. In fact, Tunic's in-game manual - arguably one of its finest features - is so heavily inspired by Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, that there are clear parallels between the two works. It's a wonderful callback to a period where manuals weren't just added filler; they were integral to the player's experience, providing hints and tips that nowadays would be relegated to a simple Tweet.\nRock, Paper, Shotgun has a more comprehensive rundown of some of the comparisons between Tunic's manual and Zelda II's manual, but here are just a few of our favourites:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Ever since the very first trailer for Tunic appeared all the way back in 2017, my Zelda senses have been a-tingling. I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. \nYou can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can somtimes be devastatingly powerful. \nRead more",

          "description": "As several members of the RPS Treehouse can attest, I have not been able to stop playing Tunic this week. I was a little cautious going in, having not particularly gelled with the E3 demo from last year, but in hindsight, that early glimpse was nothing but the tip of a tiny fox nose peeking out of its burrow. In its full, regal splendour, Tunic has become an early game of the contender for me, and a large part of that is down to its wonderfully clever in-game instruction manual.\nWhen Imogen (RPS in peace) interviewed Tunic dev Andrew Shouldice last September, they talked about how instruction manuals were a fundamental part of a game's design back in the days of the NES, and at one point he even pulled out his old instruction booklet for Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link to demonstrate some of the \"tantalising hints\" they'd offer to curious players. As Brendan (also RPS in peace) noted in our Tunic review, the in-game manual is indeed a critical part of what makes Tunic special, and the act of piecing it together page by page really does capture that feeling of discovering some great secret that only you and the dev team know about. But here's a secret between you and me: it's not by chance Shouldice pulled out that old Zelda II manual during our interview last year. His fox hero may be cut from the same cloth as Nintendo's green sword-swinger, but the art inside Tunic's instruction manual also pays a wonderful tribute to those Zelda booklets of yore, too. \nRead more",

At this stage I’m less of a worthy Tarnished warrior on their way to be crowned the Elden Lord and instead more of a Mr. Bean type, accidentally succeeding through sheer incompetence alone. I can’t explain it, but my method of defeating Godrick had the same energy as Bean making a sandwich, in that I think the game eventually just took pity on me and let me win the fight to save me any further embarrasment.\r\n\n\r\nI’m coming to terms with the fact I may never finish Elden Ring. I'm only in the second proper area, but I'm finding encounters to require a level of patience I simply don't possess. Its boss fights are simply too hard. But if I’m struggling this much at such an early stage, what else could Elden Ring possibly have to offer? What types of monstrosities lurk in the farthest reaches of the Lands Between, and how difficult are they to defeat? Spoilers, naturally, below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

String together rolls and jumps and you're not just navigating a world, but bounding through it like a gymnast (who's also a part time plumber to help pay the costs of serious competition).\nElden Ring is a terrible platformer. It's stiff and awkward and less gymnast, more Gimli on the Buckfast. But this is what makes its platforming sections good. They force you to embrace your limited toolset and channel your amateur longjumping, golfing, and climbing skills you definitely don't have.\nRead more",

Perhaps the bridge to Shrek's Swamp won't open unless you rescue the princess from Bowser's Castle later down the line.\nAnd there's nothing wrong with an open world that gently steers you in the right direction.

Turned traitors in the war between demigods and giants, their reward for loyalty to the Golden Lineage was an eternity in shackles, used as frontline fodder in bloody conflicts or beasts of burden hauling funereal carriages around the Lands Between. Since learning their history, I often muse sadly upon it, as I weave between their horribly gnarled legs in my freshly tarnished underwear and hoover up the shiny objects scattered underneath their feet. \r\n\n\r\nI’m on my second run of Elden Ring now, progressing slowly and methodically, examining every statue and reading every spell description. But the first time through, the need to cram the whole content buffet in my face at once got the better of me. Underleveled and underprepared for most areas, I developed the winning strategy of stripping down to my burial rags for a speed boost and streaking through the wilds, shoving everything valuable down my pants. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He's hardly smooth in the stirrups, nor can he really climb anything substantial. That's why I'd like Roach swapped out for Elden Ring's Torrent, a horse-goat that corners like Colin McCrae and double jumps like Super Mario.

The whole conversation I had with these two dudes was over 40 minutes long. So much of interviews gets discarded (like tears in rain etc) and the process of distilling it all down to a few quotes can be, to put it succinctly, a pain in the hole.

Heck, we don't even know if it's technically going to be called The Witcher 4 yet (it probably isn't, in fairness), but for sake of ease that's how I'm going to refer to it for the time being. \nStill, talk of a new saga has got me thinking. Does that mean we'll simply see a new protagonist in the existing Witcher timeline we know and love? (Ciri, perhaps, or young hot Vesemir?) Or will it go earlier, maybe tying into the upcoming Netflix prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin that's set 1200 years before the events of the books? Or something else entirely?

Whether this is The Witcher 4, though, we don't know - only that it will be supposedly \"kicking off a new saga for the franchise,\" according to a statement on CD Projekt's website. It will also be kicking off a new venture into Unreal Engine 5, as the developer announced they were leaving their own REDengine behind as they embark on a new, multi-year strategic partnership with Epic Games.\nRead more",

Real love letters are written by people so ruined by an oxytocin-soaked brain that they’re compelled to pick up a quill and rattle off paragraph after paragraph of rambling, horny nonsense, a hot stream of unalloyed adoration that is destined to one day be read aloud in a grave voice by the host of a mid-tier crime podcast.\r\n\n\nShredders is an actual love letter to snowboarding. It might have been coded using cut up letters from magazines. It is a pure, geeky, effusive veneration of the sport and its players, and so sincere about its passion for going down the side of a mountain on a long bit of wood that it occasionally verges on embarrassing. You’ve heard of dancing like nobody's watching, now get ready for a game about snowboarding made as though nobody will ever play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You'll be able to play as Glover in a brand new PC port coming to both Steam and GOG, and rather than restoring the old PC port that already exists, it's been \"completely redone\" using the original source code from the N64 version of the game.\r\n\nPiko Interactive are the developers behind this release. Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is. Piko's previous releases typically also include the original file for the game, so hopefully Glover purists will also be satisfied by this version. And game preservation is always a good thing.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.\r\n\n\r\nAfter having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all. Still, a beta is a beta, and there are very much some kinks to work out.\r\n\n \nRead more",

For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. \nIt's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting?

One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. \nWhile I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.\nRead more",

With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. \nIf you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay?

It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them.

In that time I’ve taken it on day trips, chatted to Gabe Newell and the Valve dev team about it, and been laughed at in a pub for inverting the Y axis on it.

PC code for FF Origin went out a bit late, so the thoughts below are my initial impressions of the game based on the chunk I've played so far, which is about half the game. This isn't a full review, but I also can't see my thoughts changing. Anyway. Let's embrace Chaos.\nStranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards. You'll finish the game and part as strangers still, probably.\nRead more",

          "description": "GPU-based upscaling has proven to be one of the most useful additions to gaming PC tech in years. Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).\r\n\n\r\nFSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The folks over at Eastshade Studios sure do have a brand, don’t they? Cozy, rustic, slow-going living with a touch of the magical has a certain appeal all its own, and as the recent announcement of Songs Of Glimmerwick proves, EastStud don’t intend on shaking up that brand any time soon. This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.\nYou see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to \"a niche of freaks\". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.\nWhen I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. \"It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away,\" he says. \"Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.\nRedout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.\nRead more",

          "description": "You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. \"There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game,\" says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as \"phenomenally unsuccessful\".\nThis led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. \"We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots,\" he says. \"So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "First unveiled last week, Ship Of Fools is an upcoming seafaring roguelite where you and a fellow co-op pal take on hordes of horrible beasties as you sail the high seas. Depending on your choice of player two, it's also likely to be an apt description of how you'll feel playing it.\nHaving waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you're pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones' locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.\nRead more",

Despite being produced by Showtime, the live-action adaptation of Halo can only be found on the Paramount+ streaming service.\nIf you're new to Paramount+ and haven't had a subscription on file, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial and squeeze in the first episode, and maybe the second if you're quick enough when it releases next Thursday. Otherwise, a full-blown membership will run as low as $4.99 a month for an ad-supported plan or $49.99 for an entire year which saves $10 if you're okay with paying for the subscription upfront. You can sign up for the trial or subscription on the Paramount+ website. The app can be downloaded on a variety of smart devices, including the most brand synergistic way to watch Halo, on your Xbox. If you're a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you can snag a 30-day trial for Paramount+ thanks to membership perks available right now.\nIf this week's premiere episode is any indication, new episodes of Halo will go live on Paramount+ every Thursday at 2 a.m. Central. The series is scheduled to run for nine episodes; however, a second season has already been greenlit and will likely enter production sometime in the future.\nHalo stars Pablo Schreiber as John–117, AKA Master Chief, Jen Taylor as Cortana, and Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey.",

One of its biggest titles is the strategy RPG Dungeon Boss, and the talent there consists of veterans that worked on games such as Halo Wars, Age of Empires, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Netflix has not revealed how much it paid for the studio.\nSince last September, Netflix has been gradually scooping up game developers to bolster its presence in the video game market. Earlier this month, it purchased Finnish mobile developer Next Games for $72 million. Netflix’s acquisition of Oxenfree developer Night School stands as its most noteworthy purchase so far. The team behind Afterparty is currently developing Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. You can read more about what the future holds for Night School in our interview with the studio’s director. \nIn addition to spreading its IP into the game industry, Netflix has a plethora of video game adaptations in the pipeline. The company recently announced plans to create a Bioshock movie and a new Resident Evil series. It also renewed The Cuphead Show for a second season. \n[Source: The New York Times]",

This new series is all about those moments, recreating the trash compactor scene, Luke Skywalker's training on Dagobah, and the Death Star trench run. These sets focus on the little visual details to make those moments pop, and are less about play, yet still allows for a degree of interaction, such as the trash compactor closing in on the heroes.\nAll three sets release on April 26. The Dagobah Jedi Training Diorama retails for $79.99 and comes with exactly 1,000 pieces. The Death Star Run Diorama is $59.99 and consists of 665 pieces. The Death Star Trash Compactor Diorama is $89.99 and delivers 802 pieces. Dianoga’s head is included in this set along with six minifigures. \nYou can see all three sets in the gallery below.

If successful, you'll likely have all kinds of new weapons and tools to bring into upcoming matches and experience gains to boot. Or you can hock most of it for some extra spending cash.\nOther players raiding the same place can spoil the run by taking your team out during firefights that are likely to break out. Alternatively, they could also hop in your ship and commandeer it as their own. Starships can be individually customized and upgraded, allowing players to escape safe and sound after gathering precious space plunder while also adding dogfighting opportunities to the match. Losing your means of escape, let alone one you've spent time beefing up between missions will be something you'll want to avoid.\nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nThe full release date is currently unknown, but a closed beta period for those who preorder is said to be happening sometime soon and will be entering early access this year.

Touted as a powerful new-gen title with stunning graphics, exhilarating gameplay, and massive arenas unlike anything that’s come before in the series, 2042 simply failed to hit those marks from a polish perspective. Fan outrage was palpable as refund petition signatures climbed to heights just shy of the hundred-thousands. Hell, at one point, more steam users were playing Farming Simulator 22 over Battlefield 2042. Even so, the next game in the franchise has entered pre-production, and developer DICE feels “valuabl…",

A small number of images have given fans brief glimpses at different setpieces, but a recent leak revealed brothers Sam and Henry. \nNew HBO's The Last of Us set photos in Calgary!\n#TheLastofUs #HBO pic.twitter.com/9OObMY4JXk\nMarch 23, 2022\nAs reported by Eurogamer, images and a short video clip were uploaded to Twitter showing Sam, Henry, Ellie, and Joel in garb similar to their in-game counterparts (see images above). The actors playing the brothers remain unknown, but The Mandalorian's Pedro Pascal is portraying Joel, and Game of Throne's Bella Ramsey stars as Ellie. Ramsey is even wearing the young heroine's iconic hoodie and winter jacket.\nThe clip, seen below, shows the four jogging across a street in some downtown metropolis. They crouch/take cover near a car (except for Joel, of course, he's too badass to hide). Then the crew disappears into a building. Where they're going is a mystery, but if the television show is following the series of events that take place in Naughty Dog's acclaimed title, the journey will be harrowing to say the least. \nNew video of Joel, Ellie, Henry and Sam on the set of #TheLastofUs!\npic.twitter.com/XpwDzND0hz\nMarch 23, 2022\nHBO’s The Last of Us is slated to drop in 2023 and is brimming with talent including the previously mentioned Pascal and Ramsey. Anna Torv (Mindhunter), Nico Parker (Dumbo), Merle Dandridge (The Last Of Us video games), and Gabriel Luna (Terminator: Dark Fate) are also cast members. Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann (lead writer and creative director on the game) are helming the show.\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

There are returning faces like Bigby Wolf and Snow White, and some new ones, too. However, if you haven’t played the game, it sounds like you’ll still be able to enjoy its sequel because in a new interview with Edge magazine, Telltale CEO Jamie Ottilie said the first episode will get players up to speed on the characters, as reported by IGN. \n“We strive to design our narratives so they can stand on their own,” Ottilie told Edge, citing that despite that, he hopes players jump into the first game to experience it before the second. \nHowever, if players don’t, they’ll still be prepared for the sequel by the end of its first episode because Ottilie thinks “the opening of the first episode sets things up in such a way that the player understands how the characters got where they are now.” \nWe’ll all be caught up after playing episode one sometime in 2023. For now, read Game Informer’s extensive breakdown of the resurrection and reinvention of Telltale Games, which covers the studio’s shutdown, its subsequent reopening, its new development on The Wolf Among Us 2 and its The Expanse game, and more. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited for The Wolf Among Us 2?

As spotted by Venture Beat, Cal Kestis’ lightsaber hilt will soon be available to purchase, thanks to it winning a 2020 fan poll for requested legacy lightsabers. \nBeginning March 25, you can buy Cal’s legacy lightsaber hilt at Dok-Ondar’s Den of Antiquities. It sports the signature damaged base but comes with a dual lightsaber adapter. That means you can make it a double-bladed sword should you buy a second hilt. You can display the replica as is, or add a blade to it at Savi’s Workshop – Handbuilt Lightsabers store. Actor Cameron Monaghan, who portrayed Cal in the game, visited Disneyland to get an early peek at his signature weapon and make it a full lightsaber. You can view the photos from his visit, such as the one above, at the Disney Parks Blog. \nThere’s no word how much Cal’s weapon will cost, but replica lightsabers can run for over $100, and adding a blade to them is similarly pricey. You can only buy the lightsaber at Galaxy’s Edge in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, FL or Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA.\nYou can watch us relieve Cal Ketis’ entire journey in our ongoing Super Replay of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which may hold you over as we eagerly await the confirmed sequel.\n[Source: Disney Parks Blog via Venture Beat]",

Keller even touched on some details regarding this change, including some switches to Doomfist’s moveset to make him a Tank. \n“He basically has a leap that’s similar to a Winston leap,” Keller said. \nWinston’s leap is more about horizontal movement whereas Doomfist’s leap, as it stands today in Overwatch, is about vertical height and resulting slamdown damage. It sounds like his leap will be more similar to Winston’s in Overwatch 2, which makes sense because it would give Doomfist the ability to reach a combat scenario quicker and tank some damage. \nPC Gamer reports that Keller further described the tank version of Doomfist as “more surviveable” with “good escape” capatilibies. During the stream, Overwatch lead hero designer Geoff Goodman said Doomfist “does a lot less damage” as a tank than when he was a hero, but he also said that today, in Overwatch 2’s closed alpha, Doomfist is overpowered and in need of a nerf. \nThis is a big change for Doomfist, which accompanies larger changes happening in Overwatch 2, like a shift to 5v5 gameplay. Bastion will also be wildly different in Overwatch 2, as well.

As expected, it features some sights that fans of Netflix’s Stranger Things will recognize, like the infamous Demogorgon, the trademark red skies, and more. As it’s still Far Cry 6, protagonist Dani Rojas will be the playable character during this crossover mission, but perhaps some familiar faces will show up in it, too. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nOn top of that, this mission will be playable by all because this weekend – March 24 through March 27 – Far Cry 6 will be free to play. Like the rest of Far Cry 6, this crossover mission can be played alone or in co-op. \nDespite being announced months ago with a release date less than 24 hours away, not much is known about this Stranger Things crossover. It’s certainly an odd piece of DLC, considering there’s not much, if anything, that connect the two franchises, but it looks like it’s going to be a good time nonetheless. Fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to find out because it’s out tomorrow. \nFor more about Far Cry 6, read Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 action games to play right now.

The blight is a mythical storm that mutates anything it touches and has turned the beautiful world of Athia into a terrifying magical hellscape. Enemies physically change depending on which of the three tiers they fall into. The deeper you go into the storm, the higher tiered the foe will be, and thus the challenge also rises alongside their increasingly scary appearance. On top of that, we highlight the Pitiless Arbiter, a mini-boss terror that Frey will have to vanquish if she hopes to return home.\nThank you as always for watching our latest cover video.

It’s... imaginative, to say the least, though I can’t imagine the dust and debris those controllers will collect over time. But at least they should feel comfy to hold. \nThere are two ways to get your hands around this unique piece of hardware. You can either retweet the sweepstakes tweet and include #XboxSonic2Sweepstakes or redeem Microsoft Rewards Points (US only) in the console’s rewards app. You can read the official rules by visiting the contest’s Xbox Wire post. The contest begins today and wraps up on April 30. \nSonic the Hedgehog 2 premieres in theaters on April 8, but it’s already getting a third film and a spin-off series on Paramount+.

Last summer, Hudson announced the company on Twitter, stating, \"[Humanoid Studios is a] videogame company built to unleash the creative freedom of developers - bringing innovation and artistry to players through an all-new IP.\" The details surrounding this project have remained a mystery for almost a year, but new concept art uploaded to the developer's site might offer some clues about what Hudson and co. are making. According to the now-updated home page, Humanoid Studios is creating a multi-platform science-fiction game.  \nHumanoid Studios' \"Our Mission\" section reads as follows, \"Delivering magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe and supportive environment. Our current project is a multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe.\" The background art on the site is reminiscent of games like Destiny and GTFO. Of course, Mass Effect influences are apparent, too, with ethereal alien ruins, craggy vistas, and hazy underbellies. \n\"By combining excellence in the arts with innovative technologies, videogames have the extraordinary power to transport you to new worlds of adventure,\" Hudson states. \"That's what first inspired me to make games, and it's at the heart of what we do at Humanoid Studios.\" When the developer's flagship title will release is anyone's guess, but it's safe to assume that the game is still in early development as several roles – from level designers to systems programmers – are being sought out. \nWhat do you hope to see in Humanoid Studios' upcoming sci-fi adventure?",

It begins with a Sea Fort, a new addition to the game as of this month’s Season Six, where we see one pirate held captive in a jail cell watched by two pirate ghosts from a Spanish fleet. The two speak of their dreaded captain, and it turns out, it’s The Servant of the Flame, who longtime players will recognize as the former leader of The Reaper’s Hideout. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer above, The Servant of the Flame wants something from the pirate held captive, but before we can find out why he needs her, the trailer cuts to a ship sailing just outside the Sea Fort. We then see the Masked Stranger, who some suspect is either in cahoots or at odds with The Servant of the Flame. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long because Forts of the Forgotten begins this Thursday, on March 24, and will run through April 7. \nSea of Thieves’ first adventure, Shrouded Islands, was released in February. Forts of the Forgotten represents a new addition to the game that will happen each month. \nAre you excited about Forts of the Forgotten? Let us know in the comments below!",

If you also own an Xbox, the functionality of this new feature is quite similar to the groups setting on Microsoft's console.\nThe latest #NintendoSwitch update is now available, including a new feature to create groups for software on the console.\nhttps://t.co/RuNTfgEKBl pic.twitter.com/UFiwuOc1fw\nMarch 22, 2022\nFor more information, including images, head here. But I'll also be listing the ground rules of creating software groups on Switch below. You'll probably be happy to hear that the update has accounted for large numbers of potential groups:\nThe All Software menu and groups are only available when more than 12 software titles are saved on the Nintendo Switch system.\nUp to 100 groups can be created with a max of 200 titles per group.\nThe same software title can be added to multiple groups.\nAnd here's a comprehensive step-by-step summary of how you can go about making any group of your choice:\nMake sure your Nintendo Switch system has been updated to version 14.0.0 or later.\nFrom the Nintendo Switch HOME Menu, scroll all the way to the right and select All Software.\nPress the L Button to view your software by groups.\nThe first time you create a group, you’ll get a popup where you can select Create New Group.\nAfter the first group has been created, click the +Button to create a new group.\nCheck all software titles that you want to add to the new group, then press Next.\nRearrange the software titles as desired, then press Next.\nEnter a name for the group, then press OK.\nThe new group will be added to the list of Groups.\nAnd there you have it. Now you'll be able to organize your games by franchise, genre, and more. Hopefully future Switch updates will bring even more customization options. I, for one, am hoping to eventually select dynamic themes for my dashboard. Only time will tell what else Nintendo has in store for its playerbase.",

It might take a bit to explain why, but it all starts with Ghostwire's best feature: its cold, lifeless map. \nEarly in the game, a supernatural force causes everyone roaming around the Shibuya Ward of Tokyo, Japan, to vanish.

In fact, last week, Square Enix, which published the title, sent out surveys to players asking them how the game can be improved. This makes it clear that Square Enix has plans to make the game better and that means more work on it from developer Platinum Games. \nIn case that wasn’t clear, though, the official Babylon’s Fall Twitter account posted a message stating that the “continuing service” of Babylon’s Fall is not in danger. \nToday, we revealed new information about version 1.1.0, the NieR:Automata collaboration event and the future of BABYLON'S FALL development.\nhttps://t.co/DhGbngEdlK pic.twitter.com/VUmCn2FrLn\nMarch 18, 2022\nAs you can see, Platinum Games and Square Enix have plenty of future plans for the live service action RPG, with content for at least up to Season 3 planned.
