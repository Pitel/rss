And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.\nGranted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.\nRead more",

How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?\"\nThus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.\nRead more",

The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.\nRead more",

Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.\r\n\n\r\nI was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.\nLast week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.\nRead more",

Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. \nIn the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. \"Arrow to the knee\" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of.

It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, \"Get a hold of yourself you buffoon\".\nI got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.\nRead more",

Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3. \r\n\n \nRead more",

And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.\nRead more",

It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” \r\n\n\r\nLaidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.\nOr, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.\nSons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.\nRead more",

That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.\nIn practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering.

That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. \r\n\n\r\nConsternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that \"the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec.\" Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is in addition to Birdo, who made their debut in Wave 4.\nInterestingly, instead of rearranging the character select screen, Birdo appears in a brand new column, with five more slots below them denoted by a \"?\" With the Mario universe as vast as it is at this point, the realm of speculation is probably limitless, as any character, no matter how small (Goombas!) could show up. Note that there are two more waves to go until these five slots are potentially filled; and of course, this might not be the definitive end of all DLC for the game.\nWho could the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC characters be?\nJust based on a few racers that have appeared in other games, there's a short list:\nFunky Kong (Mario Kart Wii/Tour)\nDiddy Kong (Double Dash/Wii/Tour)\nHoney Queen (Mario Kart 7)\nWiggler (Mario Kart 7)\nPetey Piranha (Double Dash/Tour)\nThis list also isn't exhaustive, and Nintendo could surprise us with out-of-left-field characters like they did with the Animal Crossing Villager and Link from the Zelda series. I can also see Pauline making it in by the end, especially given her appearance in Mario Golf: Super Rush.

The action-packed Gothic adventure will be briefly removed from storefronts while the name change takes place.\nThe need to pull the ol' switcheroo comes in response to a legal claim from the owners of fantasy franchise Grimguard — a series that utilizes the similar sounding name for its range of tabletop and mobile titles. It's no doubt a frustrating situation for Inti Creates, but given the Demon Purge is part of the Gal Gun series, the name change is still a snug fit.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7uWrjl95k4&ab_channel=INTICREATES\nReleased last month on PC and consoles, Grim... Sorry, Gal Guardians: Demon Purge is a metroidvania-like title that weighs in a little heavier on the arcade action over the RPG elements. As noted in our review, it offers dynamic and engaging co-op action, punctuated with good humor, and dressed up in lovely pixel art and a cool, Castlevania-lite soundtrack. For fans of the classic Konami series, as well as SNES aficionados everywhere, it's definitely worth checking out.\nGal Guardians: Demon Purge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

But while XIV's bunny ear wiggle emote is mostly a fun little gesture for players, the buns among us seem to be a bit weirded out.\nThe new emote Ear Wiggle, or /earwiggle, is a reward for reaching Rank 8 with the Loporrits, a pretty hefty achievement to accomplish. When used, it lets the player spawn a pair of their own bunny ears and make them do a little wiggle.\nFor Viera, who already have bunny ears, this can look a bit jarring, as those crawling through the update have already found.\nhttps://twitter.com/ivalicea/status/1633121658063015943\nGranted, these achievements usually take a pretty fair amount of time to accomplish, so there's still time for the team at Square Enix to take a look at the emote before the wide populace can start using it around the Limsa Aetheryte.\nStill, it's left some Viera players feeling a bit disappointed in the outcome. Given the artwork from the 2023 new year celebration, which featured Viera doing the Loporrit emote with their own Viera ears alongside the smaller bunnies.\n\nWishing on the rabbit's foot\nI do get the disappointment. I'm an Au'Ra player, and I'd be bummed if some sort of draconic emote didn't lean into those aspects of my Warrior of Light. But as an Au'Ra player, I've also seen the ways in which the cosmetic portions of characters can create general weirdness.\nViera are the case-in-point, as headgear for the bunny-styled characters has been a sticking point. The four ears of the bun-pocalypse is indeed haunting though, and so part of me does hope the buns get an emote they'd like.\nIf you want to start grinding for your own set of bunny ears, you'll need to get to work on your Loporrit quests in Final Fantasy XIV.

          "description": "Alliance and Horde, together at last\nWorld of Warcraft is getting its patch 10.1 \"Embers of Neltharion\" as part of the Dragonflight content rollout. And when it arrives, it'll add a feature that should bring the World of Warcraft a little closer together through cross-faction guilds.\nThough guilds had to stay within faction lines previously, the new patch will allow guilds to exist across the barriers of Alliance and Horde. The faction binary has long defined World of Warcraft, as the war of Alliance v. Horde raged on. But in years since, that has loosened; patch 9.2.5 for Shadowlands introduced cross-faction instanced content to the MMORPG. Now, Blizzard is bringing guilds into the togetherness.\n\"We see this as a conservative step in the same vein as cross-faction instances,\" World of War…",

          "description": "Now you can be insulted on a whole new platform\nSony has released the latest firmware update for its princely gaming platform PlayStation 5 (PS5) — The 23.01 update is now available to download to the console, weighing it at a little over the 1GB mark.\nPerhaps the most notable addition here is the long, long-time coming integration of the Discord service, which will let PS5 users sync their current Discord accounts to the PS5 console, offering up new ways of communication with friends, enemies, and new enemies. The PS5 Discord service will also allow for game invites, party chat, and even screen sharing. Thus, it will be a useful tool for anybody who frequently plays with friends, or likes to make meandering, half-interested conversations while gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sHOKZCYkg&t=1s&ab_channel=PlayStation\nIn addition to Discord, the new update offers up a fistful of new technical features. These include a 1440p Variable Refresh Rate option (provided you have games and displays to support such an option). The DualSense controller can now update wirelessly, and PS5 to PS5 data transfer can now be made over Wi-Fi (ah wouldn't).\nIn a neat touch, Game Capture can now be activated by voice, allowing players to simply call out \"Hey PlayStation, capture that\" for an instant recording of recent gameplay, without having to break their flow fiddling through menus. This tool is particularly cool if you're somebody who frequently shares clips online. I still feel weird talking to my console. But then, I feel weird talking to anyone.\nThis just scratches the surface of the new update, which also includes an improved Screen Reader, revised folder filters, and new library options for PSVR 2 titles. For full details on Version 23.01, check out the official patch notes over on the official PlayStation Blog.\nThe post Discord among new features in today’s PS5 firmware update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Physical edition hits PlayStation today\nWhen we reviewed The Rumble Fish 2 in December 2022, we were quick to praise its unique style and great gameplay, but fairly chastised the old-school scrapper for forgetting some hugely important features — vital to any modern fighter, re-released or otherwise. Fortunately, a new update for the cult release will address some of these misgivings today.\nThe new update, live now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms, contains several vital online options, these include a new Spectator Mode for waiting players, as well as a rematch option at the end of each fight, saving you from having to return to the lobby and search for the same opponent. Additionally, a new indicator will give players a heads-up on their opponent's connectivity, and will also offer the ability to reject a match if the connection is poor.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHBPAQzu_nQ&ab_channel=3goo\nThe Training Mode has also been tweaked, offering multiple settings for your training dummy, as well as adjustable recovery options for your meters. The Training Mode will also now allow you to save your lab settings for future sessions. Finally, the match timer can now be set to 99 seconds max, and a new \"Combat Range\" option should prevent a frustrating bug that was causing combos to drop in widescreen ratio. These adjustments will help bring the rerelease up to par with some other fighters, and a further update is expected in April.\nIn related news, indie publisher Clear River Games has launched a physical edition of The Rumble Fish 2 on PlayStation platforms, with a Nintendo Switch edition releasing on March 28. You can order the physical edition from game retailers in Europe and North America, while the digital edition is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post The Rumble Fish 2 update adds important key features appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beyond the additions of Chrom, Robin, and Veronica: the patch also has two changes, in addition to \"issues that have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience\" (thanks for the specifics!).\nFor one, you'll be able to exchange items at the ancient well in the Somniel hub, after talking to the proprietor of the armory. You can also use inherit skills in the arena. Small potatoes for sure, but hopefully all of these patches will sprinkle in quality of life changes like this: just like the prior February 8 patch added the recreation interaction to the pool, orchard, and stable zones in the hub.\nMore features in the hangout hub is a great thing!

The new expansion will be bringing new songs and weapons to the award-winning actioner on March 29.\nTwo new headbangin' tracks will be included in the DLC. The first will feature the powerhouse vocals of Lacuna Coil frontwoman Cristina Scabbia, who I've super-duper fancied for literal decades, but don't tell her I said that because I'm shy. The second track is performed by Will Ramos of New Jersey's Lorna Shore, who I haven't heard of, but don't tell them I said that because I'm super-duper old. The searing vocals of both artists will soundtrack your next trip out of the underworld.\nhttps://twitter.com/MetalHellsinger/status/1633120493497638913?s=20\nIn addition to the new songs, the Metal: Hellsinger Dream of the Beast DLC will also include a devastating new machine gun \"The Red Right Hand\", as well as a selection of new player skins that will add new modifiers to the game. So, even if you've already run this unique and super-cool shooter into the ground, it seems that the new update will give you more than enough reason to bust out the devil horns once again.

          "description": "This is the rumored first-person season\nJust a few days ago we were given copious leaked info for the upcoming Fortnite season, which will shift away from The Witcher and the medievil focus into something else entirely. Thus far the key info we've gotten seems to be \"first-person mode\" (likely similar to how no-build is a separate, hopefully permanent mode now), and a neon aesthetic. A new tweet from Epic Games appears to confirm the latter.\nhttps://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1633120555153989636\nThe tweet is classically \"Fortnite vague\", and just reconfirms the neon setting that has been present in leaks and rumors this past week. The phrase \"made with precision\" seems to be referring to the chef in the picture (who could be a skin), teasing players to \"prepare for Fortnite Mega\" (which could simply be the nomenclature of the new season/zone). As usual the marketing for Fortnite is on point; as there's a combination of rumor-spreading, speculation, and semi-confirmation that's just enough to talk about. Once the seasonal skins and tie-ins are fully confirmed, that's when the floodgates will open.\nThe biggest news out of this tweet is that the new season (Chapter 4 Season 2) actually starts on March 10 (note: the current season ends on March 8). A follow-up tweet confirmed that there would be downtime on March 10 at 2AM ET, with the season likely debuting shortly after.\nThe post “Fortnite Mega” teased in new tweet, new season coming March 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

With Metroid Prime’s fantastic remaster in recent memory and Resident Evil 4’s remake just up ahead, those of us who like to re-experience old favorites with re-done visuals are eating good. Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is something special, however. Originally released exclusively on Wii in 2008, it never left Japan. While the re-release of Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water was apparently enough to warrant a remaster, I’m surprised Koei Tecmo would go to the effort of localizing such a niche title.\nI’m glad they did.

Players can earn or purchase various new cards in order to build up their deck, and take part in limited-time events, seasons, and tournaments. Currently, the title is enjoying an Ant-Man-themed event, in collaboration with the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe release Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ&ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment\nDue to the exciting nature of the game's roster as well as a short playtime of only a few minutes — Marvel Snap won over a huge community of players at Quicksilver speed. Roughly 12 million players downloaded the title in its launch month with around $30 million in revenue pulled in by January of this year. Of course, many mobile titles enjoy this burst of incredible success in their opening six months, and time will tell whether Marvel Snap will continue to grow over the remainder of 2023. But given the popularity of the Marvel brand, and the overall quality of the game itself. I would expect those microtransaction bucks to keep rolling in for the foreseeable future.\nMarvel Snap is available now on iOS and Android platforms.

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play.

          "description": "Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary \"photo mode\" way we are all now familiar with.\nThis episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.\n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Final Fantasy XVI, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, Atomic Heart, Metroid Prime Remastered, WWE 2K23, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, and more.",

          "description": "Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. \nMore specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. \nCheck out the game in action in the new trailer below: \n\n\n\"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,\" a press release reads. \"Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. \n\nThe Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence. \nAre you checking out The Mageseeker next month? Let us know in the comments below!",

The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.\nThe DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.\nThese updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.\nBoth of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's \"Best Shooter\" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. \nCheck out the shoes in the gallery below: \n\nEach of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. \nShoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \n[Source: Techraptor]\nWhat do you think of these Final Fantasy XIV shoes?

          "description": "Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. \nYesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, \"Get Ready For Battle\" and \"A New Sparking Begins\" appear on screen. \nCheck it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below: \n／\n「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ\n#ドラゴンボール #バトルアワー pic.twitter.com/VMMPWWeSUr\nMarch 5, 2023\nAs you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with \"A New Budokai Tenkaichi\" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  \nThe teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review. \nAre you excited for a new Budokai Tenkaichi game?

          "description": "Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. \nThe official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:\nMatsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. \nPerhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.\nIn recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.",

You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.\nThe Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. \n\n\nThis DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, \n“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”\nThis pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. \nPowerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.",

The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. \n\n\nDead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. \n\"We were already talking about the second game,\" said Asmussen. \"I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game.\" \nAsmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas \"that we could do beyond that as well.\" \nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer's interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat. \n[Source: IGN]\nIs Star Wars Jedi: Survivor a day-one pickup for you?

The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.\nThe special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. \nOther big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.\nAre you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch?

          "description": "Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.\nTelltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.\nWith such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. \n\"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it,\" Ottilie tells IGN. \"You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year. \n[Source: IGN]",

It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. \nWith such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. \nHis answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. \nSuzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. \n“Clive.” \nThere you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.",

Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.\nParticipants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.\nScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.\nWe have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.\nWe are looking forward to your application and participation!\n>",
