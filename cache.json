And no, you can’t buy this one sadly.\nNintendo of America shared a short clip of this behemoth on Twitter, which is based on ‘The Mighty Bowser’. That already pretty big LEGO Bowser already has over 2800 pieces, but this jumbo-sized display model makes that look pitiful.

          "description": "Remember F-Zero?\nIf you look at the Mario Kart franchise and the F-Zero franchise, it's pretty easy to determine which of the two has been more successful. On the one hand, Mario Kart has seen major releases all the way up to 2020 with Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, and will see a whole bunch of DLC launched for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe all the way through to the end of 2023. Then on the flip side, F-Zero - oh, our poor dear F-Zero - hasn't seen a major release in nearly 20 ruddy years when F-Zero Climax launched in Japan in 2004 - so we didn't even get it in the west! Grumble...\nIt seems strange, then, to imagine that Nintendo would think to implement a mode within Mario Kart to potentially help the game reach F-Zero fans. Well, that's what very nearly happened with Mario Kart 64 during development of the game in the mid '90s. According to director Hideki Konno, Mario Kart 64 actually once featured a 'no-item' mode that would allow players to focus on the act of driving and compete in \"serious races\". Eventually, however, the mode was dropped from the final game due to the fact that players demoing the title refrained from choosing the mode.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Seems like the impending heat means people just want to get cosy with something familiar!\nThat means F1 22 has lost its grip on pole position after two weeks at the top, but it’s now comfortably in second. And racing seems to be the thing as chart favourite Mario Kart 8 Deluxe boosts into third.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The Pokémon MOBA showcases its competitive chops in August.\nBefore last year, a Pokémon spin-off in the style of League Of Legends felt like an obscure offshoot, even for a franchise that’s pitched Pikachu as a coffee-swilling detective. In many ways, a Pokémon MOBA makes considerable sense – as a world filled with hundreds of unique monsters and built on battling – but it’s the first time we’ve seen the franchise adapted into a team-based multiplayer game that’s largely propped up by its popularity as an esport.\nPokémon Unite is pitched as an accessible entry point into an intimidating genre, and by most metrics, it’s successful. There are annoyances with the free-to-play model, like the overwhelming amount of in-game currencies and a general lack of polish, but its shorter 10-minute matches, emphasis on scoring points, and reliable, speedy matchmaking, make the experience far more approachable and instantly gratifying in comparison to League of Legends or Dota.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We took a look at the fantastic GameCube entry in the Mario Kart franchise: Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. We'd love to say it was a close call, but it kind of wasn't... The US/EU version of the game took a fairly hefty 66% of the vote, beating out the more restrained Japan edition.

          "description": "Shoooryuken!\nIf you're into anime, then chances are you can remember the first movie or TV show that got you hooked on the medium; your \"gateway drug\", if you will. For some, it might be TV shows like DragonBall Z or One Piece, others perhaps a specific movie like Ghost in the Shell or Akira (indeed, I had to really go back through the memory archives to determine whether Akira was the first one for me; it was definitely incredibly early in my life). For me, however, the very earliest memory I have of watching anime was the incredible video game adaptation, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, released in 1994.\nI'll admit, I wasn't super into the Street Fighter series when I was young. In fact, it probably wasn't until Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike that I really started to take notice. I did, however, dabble in Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition on the Mega Drive. I was terrible at it, naturally, since I was still in single figures at the time, but I really enjoyed playing as Ryu or Ken and just spamming the 'Hadoken' move non-stop (which still wasn't quite enough to win most of the time, granted).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.\nStray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.\nRead more",

Today, however, devs Johnbell have announced a brand-new faction for the game, the sand-loving Dune Reavers. Even more intriguing, though, is that the Dune Reavers aren't actually big fans of building, you know, towers, favouring instead the brute force approach of their large armies. Can you still call it tower defence if there aren't any towers involved? Decide for yourself by watching the new gameplay trailer below. \nRead more",

With Gwent: Rogue Mage, I can feel that drive slowly creeping in again. \nThe latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments. \nRead more",

And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched).

Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.\nAfter a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.\nRead more",

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.\nRead more",

          "description": "Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.\nRead more",

          "description": "Next year will be the \"most exciting\" in Dead Cells' history\nTime rolls on, and so does Dead Cells. Today, the team at Motion Twin shared an updated roadmap for the future of Dead Cells, which is set to carry into 2023 and contains some big things.\nThe team says this update is specifically to combat the belief that, after the latest DLC, Dead Cells is at or near the end of its lifespan.\nCurrently planned for 2022 is the panchaku update and flame head outfit, as well as some rebalancing and reworking. Then this fall, Motion Twin plans to launch a Boss Rush mode for Dead Cells.\nMore updates are set for winter as well. Keep in mind these are all rough estimates, and nothing's quite set in stone.\n\nThen, in 2023, the team is advertising the \"most exciting year\" in Dead Cells' history. Motion Twin says it will be the biggest year since Dead Cells 1.0 launch.\n\"What we're getting at here is that we're very much in the mid-life of Dead Cells. We're not sneaking out at night to get drunk on street corners anymore, but we've still got plenty of life in us before our knees start to give in, so prepare yourselves for more Dead Cells content.\"\n\nNot quite dead after all\nTo its credit, the Dead Cells team has been steadily rolling out update after update over the years. Even though the action roguelike is roughly four years old at this point, Motion Twin and its spin-off studio Evil Empire have kept on delivering new content.\nSo, even though The Queen and The Sea DLC went live earlier this year, rumors of Dead Cells fading out of the picture seem to be greatly exaggerated. As for what Motion Twin and Evil Empire have planned for 2023, we'll have to see in the new year.\nThe post Dead Cells roadmap has updates headed all the way into 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sales show no sign of samurai slowdown\nSucker Punch Productions acclaimed adventure title Ghost of Tsushima is edging ever closer to the 10 million sales mark, having shifted a hugely impressive 9.75 million copies since its initial release in the summer of 2020.\nThe new sales figures are noted as part of a wider stat report released by the developer, which details the number of times wannabe samurais have indulged in some of the title's bloodthirsty, (and less bloodthirsty), activities over the course of the past two years. This period has seen an incredible 91.4 million Legends Mode missions played, a staggering 540.8 million Duels engaged, and — perhaps the most amazing stat of all — a huge 998.5 million pulse-pounding Standoffs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3TXsfTCs\nStill, despite these bewildering sales numbers, the aforementioned stats are not the greatest Ghost of Tsushima milestones offered by the report. That title is bestowed upon the island's own Good Boys — the foxes — which have been petted by players 75.18 million times. This is perhaps the most relatable of all the statistics, as the foxes are one of the few activities on Tsushima island that provides respite from all the violence and bloodletting. Glory be to the foxes. Here's hoping that they make an appearance in the upcoming film adaptation.\nYou can check out the full list of statistics in the tweet below. Ghost of Tsushima is available now on PS4, while Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is available to purchase on PS5. This latter edition includes the Iki Island expansion, along with 4K visuals, improved load times, new filters, a Japanese lip-sync option, and support for DualSense capabilities.\nhttps://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1548034687049748480?s=20&t=aiQIJEh8383uIkkiVOGjTA\nThe post Ghost of Tsushima sells nearly 10 million copies, pets 75 million foxes appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the base game will still launch on July 29, the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition contents won't roll out for Europe until after the game's launch.\nIn a statement, Nintendo says that due to \"unforeseen logistical challenges,\" the company is unable to open pre-orders for the collector's edition until after the game launches.\nRather than hold off on selling the game, Nintendo will be offering the contents of the Collector's Edition as a separate purchase. That way fans can purchase Xenoblade Chronicles 3 at launch and not have to re-buy the software.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-iNpDKuYb8\nThe Collector's Edition includes a softcover concept art book, a steel case, and the outer packaging that holds everything.\nPre-orders for the Collector's Edition contents will open sometime later in September. The special contents of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition are expected to be delivered sometime around autumn 2022, and all items will be shipped with free delivery. You can sign up for updates on the Nintendo UK site as well.\n\nA sought-after special edition\nThe rollout of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector's Edition hasn't been smooth sailing. The online store has had a few pre-order windows, and they were usually accompanied by waves of people sitting in a long virtual queue and not making it in. The online storefront even crashed for some. Nintendo has to host several waves of releases as it resolved issues with purchasing physical products on the My Nintendo Store.\nWhether this will still be a sought-after Collector's Edition in September, we'll see. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is due out later this month on July 29. As Chris wrote in our preview, the RPG is so far everything he needed it to be.\nThe post Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collector’s Edition delayed for Europe past the game’s launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Cutting out a lot of fluff and elbow grease, the creator walks us through the process in an informative 20ish minute video, with \"obscene amounts of glue\" holding it all together.\nLike all their creations it's a feat of engineering, with some trial and error, married with carefully crafted and meticulously planned concepts via digital testing. Tofu containers ended up giving the ship that perfect \"metal panel\" feel, and comprise the outside of the ship's foundation. Everything from dollar store trophies, to toothbrush heads, to hair rollers. Of course, it all needs to be painted (that starts around 7:30 in), which is in and of itself a whole extra journey and skill: that Studson Studio manages to pass with flying colors.\nIf you're curious about the rest of their creations: they're just as incredible! The most popular video they have is their astounding Howl's Moving Castle replica that frankly belongs in a museum.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1HhqE5x0MM\nThe post This artist amazingly made the Super Mario Odyssey ship out of trash appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Homeward bound\nStray isn't just a good time for cat lovers, it's a good video game, period. A great one, even.\nThe unassuming protagonist — a normal cat in a not-so-normal sci-fi world in which humans are long gone — is the star of the show. But the game's surprisingly endearing robot companions, and strange, decaying yet vibrant city they inhabit, are also high points. I didn't expect the setting to draw me in and capture my imagination this much.\nIf you like the sound of a puzzle-adventure game that rewards curiosity and stays fresh the whole way through with a wonderfully fleshed-out world, you've gotta play Stray.\n[caption id=\"attachment_335077\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] The lighting and color deserve a shout-out.[/caption]\nStray (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed])\n\nJust as a general conce…",

The fix comes after the developer had previously denied that the bug was even in existence, suggesting that players were simply accidentally purchasing the cosmetic items themselves.\nReddit first complained about the bug before the weekend, with one user providing an example of how simply viewing items was instead causing the game to roll out the \"Show Bucks\".

          "description": "Make some space\nNintendo has updated the official page for the newly revealed sequel, and the Bayonetta 3 file size clocks in at 15GB.\nIt's not quite as compact as a first party game (Nintendo continues to work their magic, as Mario Strikers Switch is a staggeringly low 3GB!); rather, it's a fairly standard \"AAA\" size without breaking the bank too much (like say, an open world RPG such as Witcher 3 does with roughly 31GB of space baseline).\nFor reference, here is how the Bayonetta 3 file size stacks up against the other games on Switch:\nBayonetta 1 - 8.6GB\nBayonetta 2 - 12.4GB\nBayonetta 3 - 15GB\nOn Switch, physical copies tend to matter more than other platforms. Not only are you cutting out the need for space (as Switch carts don't need to obnoxiously install anyway on your device), but typically, Nintendo games keep their value over time, especially if it's something that's technically first party (developed or published) like Bayonetta 3.\nThankfully Nintendo tends to keep their file size data updated on the official listings for all their games, so people can plan ahead if needed, and people can do all the storage Tetris they can to prepare. For people with a lot of games, it can get overwhelming sometimes!\nThe post Switch Bayonetta 3 file size is 15GB: and slightly better than Bayonetta 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Note that the video itself is a spoiler for the main game, so I'll be vague: but it's kind of hard to avoid the Warrior of Light being front and center everywhere!\nHere are the new jobs revealed through the Stranger of Paradise DLC trailer:\nPilgrim (staff wielder)\nEvoker (can use spirits that \"independently\" attack the enemy)\nSummoner (controls Bahamut directly)\nTrials of the Dragon King will also have a higher difficulty mode (titled \"Bahamut\"), which seems like a pretty key thing that hopefully will be part of a free update, as well as some quality of life upgrades. Accessory equipment is the biggest thing that stands out, as players can now adjust and utilize accessories to further customize builds.\nThe DLC is out on July 20, and will be part of the season pass.

It's Namco sequel Dragon Saber, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased into arcades in 1990, Dragon Saber is the follow-up to 1987's fantasy-themed blaster Dragon Spirit, and once again sees dragon-riding heroes take to the skies to battle armies of strange, invading creatures. As Huey and Siria, one or two players can jump into all-new simultaneous co-op action, which should give you a bit of balance against the hundreds of enemies and end-of-level guardians. In addition, Dragon Saber features a selection of new power-ups, along with a continuation of the game's lore, which was something of a novelty in the shmup genre at the time.\nUnlike its predecessor, Dragon Saber did not receive a wide range of ports, only coming home in the form of a lone PC Engine edition. Aside from appearances on Namco's previous compilations, this Arcade Archives release represents the first global release of the sequel in some years. Dragon Saber is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nYou can check out the button-punching action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po0x3MLt2ns\nThe post Dragon Spirit sequel Dragon Saber takes flight on the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

For 600 platinum you'll net a memo pad.\nAnnounced by way of My Nintendo news, the reward will contain \"full color images\" of both versions of new protagonist Shez, as well as several key characters in the narrative (including members of the titular \"three\" houses). Typically it takes roughly 1-2 weeks for these rewards to go primetime.\nHere's the full description from Nintendo:\n\"Jot down battle strategies, take notes, or simply doodle 'til you drop with this full-color memo pad themed after the new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes game for the Nintendo Switch system. Its pages feature stunning character art of new protagonist Shez (both male and female variants), Arval, Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude.\"\n\nCurrently the listing is not live. In fact, if you click on it, it'll bring you to this random printable Triangle Strategy box art cover page. But having followed rewards like this closely for some time, I wouldn't expect it to sell out instantly. In fact, several recent rewards like the Mario Strikers bag and the Switch Sports cooling towel are still up for grabs. Stranger things have happened in terms of items running out of stock, but this one should be fine within a 24-hour window of going live; at least.\n[Update: And the Fire Emblem Warriors reward is live! It's 600 Platinum.]\nThe post Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is getting a physical reward soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're in the mood to look at some badass dark-fantasy imagery, it's never too late. Udon Entertainment has issued reprints of the Design Works books for the whole trilogy.\nThe main difference with these reprints is that they sport new cover art. I'm sure some readers will prefer the original tome-like cover design, which is classy, but I'll admit that I'm a sucker for the crazed Gwyn concept art — that fiery backdrop really pops.\nThese hardcover books focus on concept art, key visuals, and character and monster designs, but there are …",

Developer CyberConnect2 confirms that it plans to release Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2.\nMelodies of Steel 2 will be a direct sequel to the first game. Not much else is known at the moment, but more news is planned for July 28. A \"Fuga: Melodies on the Battlefield\" anniversary stream is planned for that date.\nhttps://twitter.com/Fuga_CC2_en/status/1547783715476357121\nAdditionally, the first game Fuga: Melodies of Steel is on sale for 30% off on the eShop until July 24. A demo is also available, with everything up to Chapter 3 playable and saves transferrable to the full game.\nRev up that Soul Cannon\nIf you're unfamiliar with the first game, Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an RPG about a bunch of young animal children and their giant tank. No, seriously. It follows a band of misfits who commandeer an all-powerful tank to fight back against an evil empire.\nIt's got a timeline-based battle system where you need to swap around different party members on each of the gun emplacements. Certain weapons tackle enemy types like fliers or smaller ground tanks better, and characters can learn new abilities over time.\nAnd of course, if all else fails, there is the Soul Cannon. Basically a giant win card that will offer automatic victory in key fights, at the cost of a party member's soul. It's uh, bleak, to say the least.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGO3bHkNB4\nStill, it wound up being a surprisingly fun time that I was glad I tried out last year. It's got some really cool ideas with its party management, battle systems, and Metal Slug-style tank designs. The demo's worth giving a shot if any of that appeals to you, and I'm pretty intrigued in seeing what's in store for the 28th.\nThe post CyberConnect2 confirms Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 is on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the ink dried, Bungie is now officially part of the PlayStation lineup.\nSony confirmed the news today, welcoming Bungie into the PlayStation family of studios. Bungie also shared the news, saying the studio is excited for the future.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1547989404269965314\nThe deal was announced in January, near the start of the year. The $3.6 billion deal brings Destiny into the PlayStation lineup. However, Destiny will continue to publish on multiple platforms. SIE president Jim Ryan said at the time that the deal is part of Sony's strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a wider audience.\n\"We understand how vital Bungie’s community is to the studio and look forward to supporting them as they remain independent and continue to grow,\" Ryan told GI Biz. \"Like Bungie, our community is core to PlayStation’s DNA, and our shared passion for the gamer and building the best place to play will now evolve even further.\"\nDeals still in the works\nWhile the Sony and Bungie agreement is now closed, others are still waiting for approval. Microsoft announced its intent to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in January as well. The Microsoft-ActiBlizz deal is under scrutiny from several regulators though.\nTake-Two Interactive also announced its plan to acquire Zynga for $12.7 billion in January, and the deal closed in May.\nStill, the acquisitions machine rolls on, as plenty more have been announced since January. Those like the purchase of Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal by Embracer Group have still been popping up this year.

But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!\n\n\nMarcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.\nOn top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game.

          "description": "A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.\nSurvios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens \"where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\"\nThere’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.\nThis project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.",

          "description": "Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. \nAccording to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. \nYou can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.\nLoyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.\" Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. \nThese collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  \n“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.\nPlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!",

The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. \nAccording to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: \n\"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year.\"\nWhat animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to?

You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. \n\nBayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28.

          "description": "With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. \nBy way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot.

Today, Eurogamer reported that Danish company Nordisk Games acquired the studio.\nNordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:\nToday, Samuels released another statement about the studios' full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:\nWe enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, \"Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll.\" However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive's next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here. \n[Source: Eurogamer, gamesindustry.biz]",

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an \"open-zone\" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.\nComing off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…",

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

          "description": "Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. \nAccording to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

          "description": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. \nCD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. \nForspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. \nForspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.",
