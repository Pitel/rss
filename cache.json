They're full of in-between, one-time tasks, like running to the grocery store for some fresh citrus during a dinner rush or taking last-minute catering deliveries to visiting businessmen on the other side of town.

And, although the company made strong impressions with the likes of Vasara, the majority of its work was for SNK’s Neo Geo hardware, as represented by the seven games in this collection.\nPublisher PixelHeart, who acquired a license to at least part of Visco’s library, has been mining the company’s back catalogue with real vigour recently. It has published Ganryu 2 and Andro Dunos 2, both from independent developers, as well as releasing various ports, reproductions, and even a branded bartop arcade machine. This VISCO Collection, jointly published with QUByte Interactive, is either a culmination of sorts, or another brick in the wall; but, while there are a few unfortunate omissions in the library, it remains a solid and well-represented lineup.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looked like the perfect finale for an extraordinary console that kicked off with Breath of the Wild, but then Nintendo goes and puts out the best 2D Mario in 30 years with Super Mario Wonder. And between those and continuing on into 2024 you've got fantastic games like Pikmin 4, and (hopefully) the upcoming WarioWare: Move It! and Super Mario RPG extending the bookshelf even further. It's a heck of a console with an extraordinary library that Just. Keeps. Going.\nWe love it, but we're also well aware that it's not perfect, and as we begin sliding into the closing months of 2023, we at Team Nintendo Life have been pondering what lessons the fabled 'Switch 2' really needs to learn from its long-lived predecessor. The six-and-a-half years we've spent with our Switches has given us ample time to discover all the wrinkles that we hope to see ironed out in future hardware, and below we look at things we believe are essential fixes, as well as a wishlist of non-essentials we'd sure like to see.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.\nThe sandship, or rather, \"grainwake\" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. \nHappily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, \"Objection!\" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend. \nRead more",

Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot.

As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious \"large game\", originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024.

          "description": "OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. \r\n\n\r\nSo why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. \nAlan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet. \nRead more",

          "description": "At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map \"powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline\".\nI've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's hard to imagine blockblustery first-person shooting today without Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's online progression systems, which - inasmuch as you can assign this much clout to a single game or developer - transformed the genre back in 2007 by reinventing multiplayer as a kind of RPG. Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it's jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare's original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be \"unfair\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” \r\n\n\r\n\r\nPétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.\nThe game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.\nRead more",

It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. \nThe goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I'd probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I'm honest.\nRead more",

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will \"absolutely\" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions.

I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight.

This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.\r\n\n\r\nI'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.\r\n \nRead more",

But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.\nThat's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you're into that, great! If you're not, then I'd slink back into that shadow.\nRead more",

Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game's mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that \"it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn't great.\" Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... \"feature-complete\" and \"into the polishing phase\", meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.\r\n\n\r\nCloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through \"OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson\" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Specifically, he'd like to build on Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire's combat system, and use a \"scripted 3D camera\" that avoids some of the fuss of exploring the world and navigating the interface of Larian's game.\nRead more",

He slowly shuffles out of bed, keeping the light off to avoid waking his wife and his 18-month-old son. He goes out through the bedroom door, and along the hall, to his office. He sits back in his chair, and he gets high. \r\n\n\r\nIn the last nine months, Gaurav has spent £2,000 on his secret addiction. He admits to a total spend over eight years of more than double that. That is, £4,250 is the amount he admits to when talking to me – he’s never told his family. But Gaurav isn’t addicted to drugs, or alcohol or even online poker. The reason Gaurav only gets a few hours of sleep each weekend, is because he can’t stop playing FIFA Ultimate Team.  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I loved the premise of Deadnaut. It's the tactility of chunky spaceship interfaces combined with the frustration of the corporation cheaping out on everything and not caring that it'll get everyone killed. It's the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.\nI didn't love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it's sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.\nEven though it's a bloody roguelike. Godddd.\nRead more",

          "description": "At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  \nIt's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as \"initial piano concepts\" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It's so, so, so good. \nRead more",

          "description": "Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. \nIt's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).\nRead more",

The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.\r\n\n\r\nAmongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in \"revenge\" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they've made the continue button \"sexier\". Look, don't ask me, I just work here.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There was a time when print media and pixel art were like peanut butter and jelly. Before the advent of polygon-based graphics and online storefronts, nearly every game was made from chunky grids of color, and at retail, every game came with a printed instruction manual showing how to play it.\n\n\nFlash forward to 2023, and the bulk of the world's biggest games are molded from three-dimensional shapes and are downloaded directly to hard drives. The mosaic beauty of dot art, and the tactile experience of turning a page in a book about that art, have both become niche enterprises. \n\n\nBut if there's one thing we've learned in games over the years, it's that even the tiniest niches can find ways to thrive. Believe it or not, even the mighty Minecraft was once a humble indie game only known to industry enthusiasts and insiders. And it's possible that Waneella, who contributed environmental art to games like River City Girls and Pocket Rumble, could break through in a similar way. She may not have her stuff sold in the toy section of Target any time soon, but I could see her work blowing up in the fine art world in the years to come. \n\n\nDecade is a new book from talented pixel artist Waneela\n\n\n\n\n\nA case in point is her current collaboration with Darren Wall (Read-only Memory, A Profound Waste of Time) on \"Decade,\" an artbook that collects ten years of her still pictures. Initially inspired by the pixel art of Superbrothers Sword and Sworcery EP, Waneella has since grown in popularity as an independent creator. Her compositions translate great to glowing screens, but bringing them to books makes even more sense. It's easy to picture people from all walks of life cozying up to a warm mug of the drink of their choice, cracking open her book, and being transported to places that sit somewhere between games and the real world, dreams, and reality. \n\n\nYou can find the Volume crowdfunding effort for it here!\n\nThe post River City Girls artist puts pixel art to print with new art book appeared first on Destructoid.",

On one hand, it lacks the opening act to introduce the cast and get players excited for the story. At the same time, middle entries also can’t culminate in the story’s ultimate climax. Combine that with being part of a remake of one of the most beloved RPGs of all time, and you have a game that really needs to come prepared to impress. After all, Final Fantasy 7 Remake already indulged us in seeing Cloud and friends in glorious HD.

          "description": "The Creative side of Fortnite just got a new experience, courtesy of developer Torus Games and publisher Starbreeze Entertainment. Turtle vs Turtle sets two teams on top of moving platforms and puts them in a battle of base destruction. \n\n\nTurtle vs Turtle is essentially the Fortnite that you know and love with a slightly different hook. The game supports two teams of up to eight players. Each team gets a moving platform, and team members need to get to work building defenses and turrets. The goal is to keep your own platform stable and on the move while blasting your opponents’ to bits. \n\n\nBill McIntosh, CEO of Torus Games (LEGO 2K Drive, World War Z) released a statement saying: “Creating Turtle vs Turtle has been an exhilarating journey for us at Torus Games, and the support from Starbreeze has been pivotal in bringing our vision to life.” \n\n\nStarbreeze Entertainment, mostly a live service games publisher with titles like Roboquest and Payday 3, will be supporting Torus on Turtle vs Turtle as the game continues to evolve. \n\n\nScreenshot via Starbreeze Entertainment\n\n\nCreative 2.0\n\n\nThe game was built using Unreal Editor for Fortnite as part of the Creative system, which Epic released in March 2023. The toolset lets developers create new games inside Fortnite. It also lets them cash in on their work. Each month Epic pays a portion of its Fortnite revenue to creators based on player engagement with their games.\n\n\nStarbreeze's other recent live service release, Payday 3, debuted in September to mostly negative reception. Fans ran into frequent matchmaking problems and were frustrated by the game’s need for an internet connection even during solo play. An update addressing some of the issues has faced multiple delays.\n\n\nTurtle vs Turtle has a solid foundation as part of the Fortnite ecosystem, but Payday 3's rough start might make some reluctant to give it a shot. \n\nThe post Starbreeze and Torus Games launch a new island inside Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ah, Unity. Truly a textbook case of how some companies are so far removed from reality, that they make Elon Musk look relatable. The fiasco surrounding the borderline offensive Runtime Fee not only pissed off developers, but apparently even staff members didn't approve of it.\n\n\nAccording to a report from Mobilegamer.biz (via Eurogamer), sources at Unity itself say that there was \"resistance to the Runtime Fee idea,\" but concerns were said to have been ignored. It goes on to say that some people at the company weren't even aware of the new pricing system.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, insiders also claim that the controversial policy was \"rushed out\" and was \"driven by Unity and IronSource’s intense battle with Applovin over the mediation business.\" It's even been claimed that one mobile game publisher told former CEO John Riccitiello, \"F**k you, we’re not paying.\"\n\n\nUnity has been rather quiet lately\n\n\nFor those who aren't aware, it was revealed not long ago that Unity would be introducing a new pricing structure. In a nutshell: it would require developers who use the company's engine to create games would need to pay a fee per user installation.\n\n\nAs you can imagine, the backlash was quite severe. Many indie developers took immense exception to having to pay money every time someone installed their game. At the original point of the policy being announced, there was no indication of how Unity would handle illegal downloads and installations. At the time, the fee would make studios pay for both new installs and re-installs.\n\n\nSince then, the Runtime Fee has been dialed back a bit, but is still going ahead. Riccitiello has also left Unity, so the future is uncertain about what will happen going forward. Many developers have since jumped ship to alternative engines, but the insider knowledge suggests that even people working at Unity were not happy with the upcoming fees.\n\nThe post Unity insiders suggest controversial Runtime Fee was ‘rushed out’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Blizzard has announced that Diablo 4 will receive a free PC trial that is live now through October 30. Players can jump into Sanctuary on Battle.net and play up to Level 20 before needing to purchase the game. It doesn't look like the trial is available on the Steam version, and is only available through Battle.net.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the trial is also only available on PC. Console players won't have the option to try out the game before buying just yet.\n\n\nGreat time to try out Diablo 4\n\n\nSeason 2 of Diablo 4, Season of Blood is now in full swing, having been out for a little over a week. Season 1 was a bit rough, but this season is much better. Leveling is the fastest it has been yet, and all classes seem to have several viable builds. Furthermore, five new bosses have been added, which also gives players the ability to target farm Uber Unique Items.\n\n\nWith BlizzCon around the corner, it's likely we're going to see some Diablo 4 announcements. We already know Blizzard plans to release quarterly seasons and annual expansions, so it's possible we will see the announcement of both.\n\n\nFor players that try out Diablo 4 during the trial and want to continue, the ARPG is currently on sale for 25% off.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 has a PC free trial through Level 20 this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Forget Halloween! PowerWash Simulator is taking us back to the 1980s with some Back to the Future content, and it's recently been announced that the DLC will be hitting 88mph on November 16.\n\n\nThe reveal trailer is a rather simple affair. Over on the FuturLab YouTube channel, we get a 20-second teaser that shows a dirty facade. A rather standard sight for those who've played PowerWash Simulator already.\n\n\n\n\nThen comes the washing. As a poster on the door is sprayed of all its dirt, we get the reveal of the DLC and the launch date. Fans of both the game and the iconic film will be giddy with glee about getting to clean the DeLorean.\n\n\nMore immersive jet washing\n\n\nBefore the DLC arrives, you can check out PowerWash Simulator on Meta Quest, which is releasing November 2. Nothing says immersive gaming like the thrill of hosing down mud-caked walls in virtual reality (that sounds like I'm being sarcastic, but I'm really not).\n\n\nThe base game is currently available on Xbox Game Pass, so it's worth checking out if you haven't already.\n\n\nThere's been a bunch of content for the chore-based simulation game since it was released in 2022. We've had crossovers with Warhammer 40K, Final Fantasy 7, SpongeBob SquarePants, Tomb Raider, and now Back to the Future. \n\n\nIt seems there's a lot more potential for digital facsimiles of a power washing business than you might think. The simulator genre itself is evidently doing pretty well, and one can't help but wonder what popular franchise PowerWash Simulator will incorporate next. PowerWash Simulator meets Doomguy?

To rectify this, someone has made our home world that little bit more lush with fresh fauna and sea life.\n\n\nOver on Nexus Mods, user Ainsy has managed to restore Earth's atmosphere, breathing a bit of life into the dead planet. While it's not a complete restoration, the mod does give back the atmosphere, as well as the oceans, some creatures, all culminating in basically turning it into a jungle biome.\n\n\nImage via Ainsy/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nStarfield all but abandoned our planet for the main story, but this download will give you at least one more reason to revisit this extinct rock we once called terra firma.\n\n\nLife finds a way...or is at least modded into existence\n\n\nWith life restored, Ainsy's mod means that Earth now has some signs of life again, which includes outposts, enemy bases, and some mining facilities. So if you were hoping to land here in order to get away from danger...nope. It's business as usual.\n\n\nSince launching at the beginning of September, Starfield has been at the mercy of the modding community. New content and tweaks to the vanilla experience continue to make their way to the surface. The fan-made Community Patch - the collaborative effort of a series of modders – is also here to fix any bugs that Bethesda has yet to address.\n\n\nNow that hype for the has died down, a lot of players may be starting to see the lack of staying power that something like Skyrim has. Custom mods will keep people coming back for more (on PC at least), but it won't be long before conversations surrounding the elusive Elder Scrolls 6 begin anew.\n\nThe post Earth in Starfield becomes habitable again, thanks to this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

The bundle features Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 along with the new PS5 Slim. \n\n\n\n\nThis would have been interesting enough on its own, but things got more intriguing when Twitter user @The_Stebe zoomed in on some fine print. At the bottom of the bundle's box is a message that reads: \"Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon setup.\" \n\n\nOn the surface, this doesn't seem like much of a problem. It says nothing about a constant connection being required, and it wouldn't be the first PlayStation to need to be connected to the internet, as owners of the current digital version of the PS5 have to download their games from the PS Store. \n\n\nThere are some fringe cases where it may be an issue. Most notably, it leaves you dependent on Sony's servers to set up your console. Hence, in a scenario where Sony's servers shut down, it would potentially be impossible to pair up a new disc drive with a console. \n\n\nSony hasn't commented on the matter. The PS5 Slim launches in November, and you'll be able to pick from the standard version and the digital edition which you can add a standalone disc drive to.\n\nThe post An internet connection may be required to pair disc drive to PS5 Slim appeared first on Destructoid.",

Their goal is to beat the whole game with said Ocarina controller, which subs for a traditional control method for the Switch.\n\n\nHow are they doing it? As gvmimi notes: \"I have a program on my computer that allows me to map different musical notes/frequencies to different inputs.\" They also pointed out that they've cleared Breath of the Wild with an Ocarina, so their determination is now tenfold.\n\n\nZelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be talked about for years\n\n\nWhen I first experienced Tears of the Kingdom in complete isolation during the review period, I knew it was going to be big when it came to showing off emergent gameplay online (bold claim, I know!). There are just so many divergent puzzle solutions that it's a blast to see how someone else handled a problem. In fact, I specifically sought out other people who also cleared a lot of puzzles by throwing a bunch of stuff in a pile until it built a giant contraption.

Kind of like Selaco but not quite as flashy and also available now. It’s being constructed by prominent Doom modders. I have the early access, but I’ve not made it much further than the second mission. That’s not a condemnation. I just got distracted and haven’t gone back. I guess you could interpret that as a condemnation of my attention span.\n\n\nThe new episode boasts five new missions, some new monsters to drill into, and “new environmental interactions. Whenever someone uses that word, I immediately think of flushing the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D. When Mekworx uses it, they mean sucking monsters out of airlocks. Those are two similar concepts, but one is much deadlier.\n\n\nSupplice follows Zorah Null as she shows up for her first day on a terraforming job to instead find monsters. It’s worth noting that, unlike Doom, Supplice has more of a narrative, complete with voice acting. Like many retro-inspired shooters, the idea is to blend old and modern design. The fact that it uses an old engine just makes it more convincing.\n\n\nSupplice is available in Early Access for PC already.

The highlight of the new season is the electrifying new Legend: Conduit. \n\n\nFor the first time ever, Cross Progression has also been added to Apex. Following the seasons electrical theme, the Storm Point map has also been energized and overhauled.\n\n\n\n\nElectrifying new Legend: Conduit\n\n\nA new support Legend, Conduit, makes her way to Apex Legends in Season 19. Her passive ability \"Savior's Speed\" gives her a burst of speed specifically when running towards allies outside of her Tactical range. This syncs up with her Tactical \"Radiant Transfer\" This ability causes Conduit to send out a surge of energy to a teammate, generating temporary shields to the ally and herself. Her ultimate \"Energy Barricade\" allows her to deploy an array of shield-jamming devices that damage and slow enemies in its range. With this arsenal, Conduit has a versatile kit allowing her to cut off enemy rotations.\n\n\nImage via Respawn Entertainment\n\n\nEnergized Storm Point & Cross Progression\n\n\nRevamps to the Storm Point map have reduced its size while amping up the intensity, leading to players getting into more fights quicker. Players can also explore Wattston's Town Takeover - Pylon and engage in fights at ZEUS Station. Following with the theme of Apex Legends: Ignite, the map is electrified.\n\n\nWith the implementation of Cross Progression, players can now brag about their collected cosmetics, badges, and achievements across all platforms and accounts. This means you can unlock a cosmetic on PC, then jump on your Xbox and still have that cosmetic.\n\n\nI've been out of the Apex Legends loop for a while now but this seems like a great time to jump in. Cross Progression is huge and caters to casual players like me who might want to jump in here and there on different platforms.\n\n\nApex Legends: Ignite goes live on all platforms on October 31.\n\nThe post Apex Legends Season 19 brings new Legend, Cross Progression, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Risk of Rain Returns, a remake of the 2013 roguelike platformer has announced its release date, and it’s sooner than you might think. You can jump into the randomly generated action in just a couple weeks, on November 8.\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on Twitter, the official Risk of Rain account showcased a new character, the Pilot, designed to be a crowd-control prioritized combatant. Armed with a standard Clusterfire attack and a secondary attack called Target Acquired, players can make quick work of any enemies that cross their path. \n\n\nBut, they also look to be rather agile, which lets them put space between themselves and enemies. The Pilot also has a utility ability called Rapid Deployment, which makes good use of their parachute. \n\n\nRisk of Rain Returns is introducing The Pilot, in addition to another new survivor, The Drifter. The Drifter looks to be more of an up-close-and-personal melee fighter, using their sleeping bag and other everyday items as instruments of blunt force trauma. \n\n\nIn addition to Risk of Rain Returns’ release date, developer Hopoo Games also announced a celebration of the series’ community called The Festival of Gup, also set to occur live on Gearbox’s Twitch on November 8 at 10:30 a.m. PST / 12:30 p.m. CST / 1:30 p.m. EST. \n\n\nRisk of Rain Returns will be available for PC and Nintendo Switch on November 8.\n\nThe post Risk of Rain Returns returns on November 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It was recently brought to people's attention that the Master Collection of Metal Gear Solid was near unplayable on Steam Deck. Fortunately, Valve has been quick off the mark, and a fix is rolling out.\n\n\nAccording to a recent Twitter/X post from Pierre-Loup Grifais – coder for Valve – a hotifx has been deployed.  This should tend to the crashing issues people have been having with both Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.\n\n\n\n\nAs is often the case when it comes to the Steam Deck, the problem appeared to be related to compatibility issues with the device's operating system. This new patch – sent out literally moments ago – addresses issues with Proton, the Linux-based software the Deck is built around.\n\n\nWhat was the problem?\n\n\nIn a recent report/video from GamingOnLinux, the recent release of the first three Metal Gear Solid entries were shown to be not suited for the Deck. While MGS runs fine, it seems to maintain its old-school 4:3 aspect ratio, and the game is locked at 30fps. This may not be an issue for some, but others may take exception to the sizeable black borders and lower framerate.\n\n\nHowever, at least it was running on the device. The same could not be said for the second and third games, neither of which would play at all. Both Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater were crashing to the Steam Library, meaning they couldn't be played at all.\n\n\nGiven the popularity of the classic Metal Gear Solid games, it's not surprising Valve was pretty quick to act. Hopefully, MGS2 and MGS3 should run now, as the update's purpose is to \"address a blocking crash in cutscenes.\" At the time of writing, a fix for the missing audio in cutscenes is still being worked on.\n\nThe post Metal Gear Solid collection is messy on Steam Deck, but Valve is rolling out fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alongside the single, several new skins are being added to the MOBA. \n\n\n\n\nDespite the boy band being completely new to the LoL world, several members of Heartsteel may sound familiar. A few of Heartsteel's members are voiced by popular artists in real life; Kyan is voiced by Cal Scruby, K’Sante is voiced by Tobi Lou, Sett is voiced by Øzi, and Ezreal is voiced by Byun Baekhyun.\n\n\nHeartsteel-inspired skins make a debut \n\n\nPlayers of League of Legends will not only have a chance to enjoy Heartsteel’s music, but will also be able to mimic the looks of their favorite members with new skins for each member of Heartsteel in-game. Although each member will recieve their own skin, only Kayn and Yone will get different tiers of skins. Kayn is set to recieve a skin with a Legendary status while Yone is set to get a Prestige skin, in addition to their originals. \n\n\nFans can catch a glimpse of the new skins in Heartsteel's 'Paranoia' music video. Alongside the music video, an official skins trailer from Riot Games has also been released. The 'Paranoia' skins will be available to players on November 8.\n\n\n\n\nRiot Games has been debuting in-universe music groups for a while now. Some of their most popular groups were virtual K-pop group K/DA (2018) and hip hop group True Damage (2019). The in-universe music group approach that Riot Games has been taking is seeing a lot of success. K/DA blew many away with their debut single \"POP/STARS\" in 2018, which truly kicked off the League of Legends band legacy. \n\n\nHeartsteel is set to make a similarly large impact on the League of Legends universe through exciting music, entertaining visuals, and taking on the title of Riot’s first in-game boy band.\n\nThe post Heartsteel is the latest League pop crossover, with a new single and skins appeared first on Destructoid.",

In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes\nWhen host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.\nYou can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). \n\n\nWhether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.\nBeyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I'd like to see the two game series share the same universe.",

Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. \n\"On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged,\" an Atari press release reads. \"The latest entry in Atari's acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto's droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer.\" \nAlongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below: \n\nFor more about the game, including details about what to expect, read Game Informer's prior Berzerk: Recharged coverage here. \nHave you ever played Berzerk?

But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.\nStrangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.\n#TheBatman suit is available for #ArkhamKnight via the Epic Games store\n@Venturian628) pic.twitter.com/pdTMYoNvWe\nOctober 26, 2023\nAt first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. \nThe Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. \nWhile we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer's Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week. \nWould you hop back into Arkham Knight to check out The Batman suit?

While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. \n\n\nVersion 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: \nAddressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed\nAddressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions\nAddressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright\nImproved stability\nDeveloper Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. \n\"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,\" it reads. \"We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error.

With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today's Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. \nIn the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter's ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2's live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game's story. \nCheck out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAlan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2's beefy system requirements, too. \nAre you playing Alan Wake 2 this Friday? Let us know in the comments below!",

First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. \nA new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.\nThe open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. \n\n\nPlayers will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. \nThe open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.",

In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.\nWhile what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the \"first in-engine look.\" Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a \"pre-alpha footage\" tag.\nCheck out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. \nRevealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. \nHere are a few screenshots from today's showing: \n\nFor more Metal Gear, check out Game Informer's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 PlayStation 5 New Gameplay Today. \nAre you excited for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater?

A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.\nThe Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.\nNonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.",

Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. \nSome images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, \"Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.\"\nHey, @PlayStation & @cerny, we need to talk!\nhttps://t.co/GacpULuDu0 pic.twitter.com/IIF1iB2zgV\nOctober 25, 2023\nUnderstandably, many players and video game preservationists aren't enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it's unclear if it's required after that. \nGame Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. \nThe same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.\nFor more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won't come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.\nWhat do you think about this disc drive requiring an internet connection?

He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. \nStar Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

          "description": "Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.\nIn a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.\nThis feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless. \n\n\nWe’ve enjoyed our time with Peter and Miles, and you can read our thoughts by checking out our Spider-Man 2 review here.

          "description": "The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018's somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.\nThe collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.\nWe had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Read our review if you want to know about all of that.  \nNotably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform).

As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.\nAs for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. \nCheck out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. \nBuying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. \nFor more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.\nAre you jumping into Ghostrunner 2 next week?

Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. \nSpeaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.\nCheck out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paradox Rift arrives on store shelves on November 3.
