Whether it's a colour variant, a game release exclusive, or a nod back to retro consoles of the past, the company is constantly looking for ways to get a 'new' model out on the market and, so it seems, get the money out of our pockets.\nNo more so is this the case than with special edition Zelda designs. Here at Nintendo Life, it's fair to say that we are fans of the series — hands up, you got us — and a brief survey of our staff revealed a tidy collection of Zelda-themed consoles between us. And this should come as no surprise because a Death Mountain-sized pile of them have been released over the years that positively (Ganon)dwarfs all other series-specific console designs (ok, maybe except Pokémon special editions, though that's a discussion for another day).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Finally, at last, someone has made a game with all three, and it's called The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow. Anyone who's ever enjoyed pointing, clicking, Yorkshire, and horrible eldritch monstrosities should be sure to check it out when it points and clicks its way onto Switch very soon.\nThe game takes place in 19th century England, in the remote village of Bewlay, as city girl and archaeologist Thomasina Bateman arrives to investigate a mysterious barrow (read: burial mound) out on the desolate moors. Unsurprisingly, the townsfolk aren't happy to have someone new in their village — cue a lot of Hot Fuzz-like \"yer not from around 'ere\", except in a Yorkshire accent. Thomasina has to bargain, bribe, and bother people to get permission to excavate for her (thrilling) book about England's barrows.

While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.\r\n\n\r\nPossibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.\r\n\n\r\nYou guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those. \r\n \nRead more",

This brought a broad mandate to cover indie games and PC Game Pass and to do, like, whatever else I think might be fun or good. It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I've had ideas, and terrible when I've not. I'm still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I'm quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too.

This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we'd recommend it over the X any time. \nRead more",

Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.\nOut of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games.

I feel so honored - and I’m pretty happy with how the GOTY 2022 Calendar turned out, as most of my top choices made it into the roster. However, great games are sure to fall by the wayside in any year - which is why we have our Selection Boxes of honorable mentions this year, right? For my picks I've swept up three quite different games, but I think they come together to give a very Rachel vibe.\nRead more",

It depends on how quickly you scroll past, I suppose. \r\n\n\r\nI joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites!

No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, \"Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!\". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like \"Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?\" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).\nBecause we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!\n Read more",

Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, \"I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!\" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point.

Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels. In this tiny space, you, a black dot, must venture forth, solving puzzles, deciphering the strange, colourful world around you and piecing together your broken memory along the way. It's a very enigmatic little game, but one that's instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.\nRead more",

Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.\nRead more",

By Fedora 40 they will also re-visit the matter to determine if the benefits and performance costs are justified...",

But it has also made changes to its long-term portfolio to \"focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing [Wizards'] existing brands\", or that show promise in expanding or engaging their audience in new ways.\nThere will be under 15 people losing their jobs due to the changes, though the Wizards spokesperson tells Bloomberg that they will eb given a chance to seek new roles within the company. Both Hidden Path Entertainment and OtherSide Entertainment are studios potentially affected by the development, according to IGN.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOWGnC3h9WQ\nForgotten realms\nWizards of the Coast has been in the digital realm for a while, but has been making a heavier push in over the last few years. Notably, the company turned to Divinity developer Larian to take up the Baldur's Gate series and work on Baldur's Gate 3. While currently in Early Access, the RPG is slated to go live with its 1.0 version later this year. It's been garnering some praise for its early efforts, too. Some other projects, like the Dark Alliance reboot, haven't been so warmly received.\nWizards had previously stated it has \"seven or eight\" games set for the near future. It's also been opening studios like Archetype Entertainment, to develop its own video game projects. Parent company Hasbro, however, has been facing a financial downturn, with shares falling 40% last year.\nThe post Wizards of the Coast has reportedly canceled at least five video game projects appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Some new concept art teases more of The Last of Us\nNaughty Dog is celebrating the 10th anniversary of The Last of Us this year, and it's planning to share some news as part of it. The studio shared a new piece of concept art for its The Last of Us multiplayer game that's in the works, and says more news is on the way for 2023.\nThe Last of Us director Neil Druckmann announced this in a blog, detailing the franchise's history up to now and its future potential. Looking ahead to the 10th anniversary, the team plans to share more about the future of The Last of Us franchise, specifically spotlighting the multiplayer game.\n\"We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game,\" said Druckmann. \"With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.\"\nThere's also a new piece of concept art for this unnamed multiplayer project, showing off what the team has been working on. We can see some ruins and rusted scenery, but mainly, a seemingly beached cruise liner. Odds are high that place has some nasty infected inside.\n[caption id=\"attachment_356661\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Art via Naughty Dog[/caption]\nWhat's left of us\nThe Last of Us looks to have a big year in 2023, between more multiplayer news and the upcoming premiere of the HBO adaptation on January 15. Druckmann says that over the course of the season, there will be an inside look at the original The Last of Us, its Part 1 remake, and the adaptation. It's been a decade since Joel and Ellie first set out, and the pair's cross-country adventures seem poised to make a big return this year.\nThe post Naughty Dog plans to share more about The Last of Us multiplayer game this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A Soviet retrofuture in stunning detail\nWith its uncanny robots, fearsome enemies, and slick style, Atomic Heart has to be one of my most anticipated games of 2023. It somehow manages to reference all of our favorite blockbuster games while still managing to carve a path of its own -- naturally I'm excited to see a game going all out to try something new. We've gotten to see a nice lineup of trailers since Atomic Heart was announced back in 2017, and now we've got one more to add to the list. During Nvidia's CES 2023 showcase, the devs behind the game, Mundfish, let fans in on how amazing the game's ray-tracing and particle effects will look, especially in 4K.\nThis new trailer came along with an announcement that Nvidia DLSS, or deep learning super sampling, technology will be supported on 33 upcoming games, of course including Atomic Heart. The company describes DLSS as \"a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance.\" That sounds great to me, but I'm also assuming you have to have the latest graphics cards and processors to be able to run it. Not to mention a 4K monitor and all the fixins that go along with it. I'll likely play it on the PS5, because I'm probably the least tech savvy person in all of gaming. I hope the computer whizzes out there have fun though.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah74ys4t3Fs\nI can say with confidence that Atomic Heart is going to look incredible with top-of-the-line graphics, but I also think it's going to be a gorgeous game regardless of specs. It has such a fun, distinct art style and atmosphere, I think Mundfish will have it locked down regardless of which platform we choose to play the game on. I've certainly been let down before, but if nothing else, it's cool to see a studio putting something out that's so different from what we've seen in the past few years. Nice graphics are just icing on the cake.\nThe post Atomic Heart puts its ray-traced beauty on full display in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

For the Nintendo Switch, things were mostly good! Metacritic however has their story to tell, including a full \"top 40\" breakdown of the best-reviewed Switch games of 2022.\nNote that the criteria is fairly broad, as it involves every game from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 that had at least seven reviews; ranked entirely by Metascore (ratings).\nThe top 10 Switch games of 2022, according to Metacritic:\nPortal Companion Collection\nPersona 5 Royal\nXenoblade Chronicles 3\nNieR: Automata - The End of YoRHa Edition\nAtari 50: The Anniversary Celebration\nNeon White\nTunic\nCuphead in the Delicious Last Course\n13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim\nThe Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe\nSeeing a first party Nintendo game in the top five is unsurprising: but it is a bit shocking that there aren't more in there. The rest of the list is filled with ports of celebrated games (Persona 5 Royal, NieR Automata), as well as timed console exclusives like Neon White (which was only on PC and Switch for roughly six months). On the flipside there's games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which only just came to Switch this year after it was exclusive to the PS4 since 2019. It's a good mix! Several sole Switch exclusives were kept off the top 10 list due to a mixed reception (mainly looking at the new Pokemon generation).\nIt just goes to show you that the Switch really has carved out a spot for itself as a port machine that people prefer; and a platform that can deliver high quality ports if the studios are up to the task. You can find the full breakdown here, including the entire top 40.\nThe post Metacritic reveals the best-reviewed Switch games of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Beyond balance patches\nHidden Variable has released the previously announced \"major update\" for the Nintendo Switch edition of cartoonish tag-fighter Skullgirls 2nd Encore. More than just a balance patch, the new update rebuilds much of the game's engine at a core level, in efforts to severely improve the Switch edition's performance.\nThe update, practically a full reinstall of the base game, features fully-rewritten code that increases the load times of the Switch port, while also tightening up online play, ensuring more stable performance, and wiping out a litany of small, troublesome bugs. Hidden Variable hopes that this new version of Skullgirls 2nd Encore will offer Nintendo players their best experience with the fighter to date.\nhttps://twitter.com/Skullgirls/status/1610366242824626179?s=20&t=zA-lXIXiJTH2K17WE8Ky3A\nIn addition, the new update brings with it the addition of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass. Switch players can now pick up previously released season one characters — such as Annie of the Stars and Umbrella — while bringing the game up to parity with the PC and console editions in regards to balance and tournament standard features. This update has been a long time coming, and finally sees the Switch Skullgirls community rewarded for their patience.\n2023 promises to be a big year for the long-life fight franchise. The coming months will see the arrival of the sinister assassin, Black Dahlia, as well as new stages, character color palettes, webtoons, merchandise, and more. For a full report on Skullgirls' road ahead, be sure to check out our exclusive feature from last month — which includes some first-ever looks at character model sheets and animatics!\nSkullgirls 2nd Encore is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.\nThe post Skullgirls 2nd Encore Switch update rebuilds the fighter at its core appeared first on Destructoid.",

The free-for-all deathmatch mode will be available to play January 5-19, and will give seven heroes on the game's roster a whole host of new god-like abilities. Some of the affected characters will include Widowmaker, who will turn enemies to stone, Junker Queen, who will call lightning down during her ultimate to do devastating damage, and Roadhog, who will turn into a giant cyclops.\nBlizzard released a trailer as part of the event's announcement, which revealed a good number of details about what we can expect from Battle for Olympus. Players will be able to earn \"divine rewards,\" and while they don't specify what that entails, it's likely to be the usual roundup of voice lines, sprays, victory poses, and hopefully the skins that we can see in the trailer, because they look sick as hell.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbI57nJsAkU\nThe epic free-for-all battles will take place on what I consider the best arcade map: Château Guillard. But the fun doesn't stop there, because after the event is over, whichever hero has secured the most eliminations throughout the event will get a marble statue of their likeness added to the control map Ilios. Looks like our favorite heroes have a chance at immortality.\nWhile Overwatch 2 hasn't exactly been my favorite game as of late, I am a sucker for Greek mythology. I'm not alone here, and Blizzard knows exactly what they're doing in getting some more players back into the game. It looks like the game's second Season is gonna be chock full of events, because even before Battle for Olympus concludes, we'll be into the Lunar New Year event that runs from January 17-February 6 this year.\n[Featured Image via Blizzard Entertainment]\nThe post Become a god in the Overwatch 2 Battle for Olympus limited time event appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get a closer look at the Lands Between\nFor super fans, buying an art book can be one of the most gratifying pieces of merch you can collect, whether it's for their favorite show, film, or of course, game. I'm someone who really loves to see how the sausage gets made, and having a book I can flip through from time to time and get a peek at the artistic process behind one of my favorite things is weirdly important to me. If you're a fan of Elden Ring and feel the same way, you're in for a treat, because FromSoftware has opened the pre-orders for the game's two-volume art book.\nAs the best books usually are, these volumes are both oversized hardbacks at 8.25\" x 11.75\". There's plenty of content for FromSoft to show off, because the first volume is 432 pages, and the second is 384 pages long. The former will feature art of the game's opening cinematic, as well as key art, concept art, and development design documents focused on the Lands Between, its dungeons, characters, and armor designs. The latter volume will highlight the game's enemies, items, and weapons.\n[caption id=\"attachment_356578\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via FromSoftware[/caption]\nIt's looking like Amazon is the only place to pre-order the books in the western regions as of now, but there's a chance that they'll be available from other retailers once we're closer to the July 25, 2023 release date. As of now the books are also both listed for $59.99 a pop, so they'll be an investment for sure.\nFor a game as big and beautiful as Elden Ring, it would be a real shame for any of the development work to go unnoticed, because the team clearly worked hard to bring its world to life. Like I said, I love art books on principle, but I truly can't think of a property that's more deserving of one.\n[Featured Image via FromSoftware]\nThe post Official Elden Ring art books are now listed for pre-order appeared first on Destructoid.",

I used to play with a team every night in college, and I got so close with those guys, I even went to one of their weddings. It was a huge part of my life for a long time, and then it just... wasn't. The game started to change, my life got busier, and I simply moved on to other things. Every few months I would log back in for a match or two to reminisce, but I had to admit to myself that the best of my Overwatch career was behind me.\nThen, of course, there was the announcement of Overwatch 2.

          "description": "Make your matches extra super\nFall Guys has always had a great lineup of themed costumes, from Sonic to Ratchet & Clank to Portal. Their newest collaboration with yet another fan-favorite franchise is dropping January 5, and this time fans will get an opportunity to don skins from one of the most beloved animated series of recent memory: Invincible. Skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve will be available for purchase in the Fall Guys store in collaboration with Skybound Games, so don't be surprised if you see some new super-friends soaring through your matches soon. Of course, Fall Guys is a family friendly game, so we won't be seeing quite as much blood and gore as we're used to from these characters.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1610290021478580227\nAmazon Prime's acclaimed animated series Invincible is based on a comic series of the same name, written by Walking Dead comic author Robert Kirkman. Season one was a massive success when it dropped in 2021, even spawning a series of popular memes, and while we know another season is supposed to drop sometime this year, it's anyone's guess as to when we can expect it. Some fans are hoping that this Fall Guys collab means we'll be getting an update soon, and I'm certainly in that boat myself.\nFall Guys has also seen a resurgence since it went free-to-play last year, and rightfully so. I returned to the game recently after not having touched it since 2020, and it's probably even more fun than I remember due to all the new stages and content that they've added. My backlog has been keeping me plenty busy as of late, but Fall Guys is one of those games I know I'll be coming back to when my schedule clears up a bit. Certainly as a fan of the Invincible series, it'll be worth logging on to see if I can't secure some of these new skins.\n[Featured Image via Amazon]\nThe post Invincible crashes its way into Fall Guys with some new skins appeared first on Destructoid.",

This latest retread will launch on unannounced platforms later in 2023.\nFirst released on PC and PS3 way back in 2010, The Devil's Playhouse was the third of Telltale Games' Sam & Max adventures, and sees the Freelance Police investigate a series of strange phenomena linked to the powerful psychic machinations of the mysterious \"Toys of Power\". The original release of The Devil's Playhouse sported a fresh new game engine, and allowed the player to take direct control of both Sam and Max independently — allowing for a shakeup of the title's puzzle elements and adding an extra emphasis on synergy and teamwork between the two characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYPuWAQvRyw&ab_channel=Skunkape\nWhile Skunkape Games has not offered any official information on the new title, we can likely expect The Devil's Playhouse Remastered to feature updated character models and environmental textures, tauter controls, and slicker U.I. integration. If we're lucky, we might also see the new release include additional artwork, voicework, and music, as was the case for both Save the World Remastered and Beyond Time and Space Remastered. We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information — including platforms and a release date — is forthcoming.\nSam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered is currently in development at Skunkape Games.\nThe post Sam & Max: The Devil’s Playhouse Remastered hits the road in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whoa\nPocket Card Jockey remains one of my all-time favorite games for the Nintendo 3DS. I absolutely adore that little mash-up of solitaire and horse racing. In fact, it's one of just two games that I still play with some regularity on my New Nintendo 2DS XL (the other being Fantasy Life). That'll change later this month when Pocket Card Jockey comes to Apple Arcade. Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! revives the Game Freak classic for iOS devices as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game will feature races rendered in 3D along with the classic gameplay that made it so addictive.\nYou might remember Game Freak had ported the original Pocket Card Jockey to Android not long after the game launched for 3DS, but that version was never localized outside of Japan. While this version of the game is different than the Android port, it is yet another long-lost mobile title that has been rescued for the Apple Arcade service. You might remember PlatinumGames' World of Demons disappeared from app stores after its original soft release only to pop up as an Apple Arcade exclusive many months later. The same thing happened with Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls.\nWhile the Apple Arcade release calendar isn't as exciting as it once was, it is comforting to know that Apple is sticking with the service and bringing fun new titles like Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! to subscribers. Ride On! is one of a few games announced for a January release, with the others being Episode XOXO from Pocket Gems, the jigsaw puzzler Illustrated, and physics puzzler Squiggle Drop.\nThe post Pocket Card Jockey rides onto Apple Arcade later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, the final Whatcha Been Playing of 2022, as today will see another year shuffles off out of door, shrugging its shoulders and probably blaming you. I'm very grateful to all of you for showing up this weekend, and hopefully you've recovered from the festive carnage of last week in time to wreak further havoc this evening.\nI myself had a fine and quiet Christmas, which was exactly what I was looking for. I ate too much and re-visited No Time to Die and Gremlins. So, in a sense, I spent my Christmas with Ana de Armas and Phoebe Cates and nobody can tell me otherwise. It was perhaps the most chill day I have had in a very, very long time, and I hope that however you spent the holidays, it bro…",

After all, it's the time of year when a lot of us will set new year's resolutions to help us introspect and change our habits as the clock ticks over into 2023, and I want to do the same when it comes to my favorite hobby.

          "description": "The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.\nIn a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?

          "description": "Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 \"the year of PayDay 3.\" Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. \nKoch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game's new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a \"fully-fledged social heist universe\" set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the \"official reveal trailer\" for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it's less of a reveal and more of a teaser. \nCheck out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 \"the year of PayDay 3.\" Here's hoping that holds true. \nWhat do you hope PayDay 3 brings to the franchise?

Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. \nNow, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this \"first half of 2023\" window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.\n\"Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023,\" the support page reads.\nThis isn't the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. \nWhile waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda's Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield's ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year. \nDo you think Starfield will get delayed again?

By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it.

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry.

Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. \n\n\nFormally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.",

The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon.

Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.\nWith the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...",

Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die.

As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022.

Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.\nYou can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: \n\n\nFrom the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. \nThe series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.\nNieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it's not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.",

Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? \nI traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that's been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. \nSimply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking. \nDead Island 2 begins in the final days of the evacuation of LA after the zombie outbreak has swept through…",

The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.\nGolf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. \nYou can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.\n\n\nGolf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it \"a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,\" awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.\nSports Story is available now for Switch.",

As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll \"share more details once we get closer to the release.\" \n\n\nWhile many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game's director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game.

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nEpisode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle\nEpisode 2- When Doves Cry\nEpisode 3 - Bible.\nEpisode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair\n\n\nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon!
