Nicholas Snow and Thomas Snow. Not bad names – we can foresee a gritty murder mystery series starring one Thomas Snow coming to ITV in the near future – but not names that inspire enormous confidence in their capability. Nor should they, because the Snow Bros are a bit rubbish. The friendly local Twin Princesses get abducted, while Nick and Tom get turned into snowmen. And not even the flying kind who take you to see Santa then melt away while leaving behind a scarf in a skillfully produced allegory for grief. But we digress.\nToaplan's Snow Bros. is basically a take on Bubble Bobble, really, but the difference is that Bub and Bob's inaugural appearance is a masterpiece, and Snow Bros. is a weak imitation. The game surely has a cult following and prices on the secondhand market are sky-high, but it's just not that fun to play. Movement and jumping feel floaty and weird. Everything is sort of grotesque-looking, but not in that Binding of Isaac gross-cute kind of way. You walk around freezing enemies. You collect various items for points. There's very little to it and its appeal seems to extend only to its fans. A Snow Bros. fan, can you imagine?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But this is a morbid romance game with a difference.\nThe game is a spiritual successor to My Lovely Daughter, which is an alchemy sim that tests your resolve — how far will you go to resurrect your dead daughter? To do this, you had to use alchemy to create homunculi, raise them as if they were your own kids, then murder them. That's just delightful, isn't it? And the father in question is a man called Faust, which just bodes extremely well considering the origins of the name.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, Twitter user @Rafaknight_rk, a 3D artist who has worked on the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog, has gone ahead and altered the She-Hulk poster to herald Gruntila's long-awaited return.

Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?\nBecause of this, we end up talking about Blorko again. We also nearly come to war about the difference between randomly improvising funny stuff and deciding that saying 'egg' a lot of is funny. There is a difference, but you know it when you see it.

          "description": "Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like \"Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,\" and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we've heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

          "description": "From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience.

Screenshots show what could be any other isometric RPG like Path Of Exile or something – anything.\nSo, you dive in expecting an average time. One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you've closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no! V Rising is the opposite of average; it should be renamed V-ERY GOOD Rising. Forget the art, the description, the screenshots. Just give it a shot.\nRead more",

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.\nRead more",

          "description": "Happy Eurovision day, everyone! Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama. Honestly, this year's contest better be amazing, considering some great songs have already been knocked out before the finals. I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria's pop goths and Latvia's song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that's the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?\nRead more",

          "description": "AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. \r\n\n\r\nThe lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

This is a very broad topic for discussion, so that means I also get to say 'ludonarrative dissonance' (we also describe 'ludonarrative harmony' as its opposite). Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.\nThe times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the \"It's me, Blorko!\" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.\nRead more",

If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.\r\n\n\r\nThe game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them. \r\n\n \nRead more",

But here's the thing — I sometimes feel like we can obsess a bit too much over how real or not real a certain game's art style is, picking apart every environment and every little detail on the character models.\nI think back to the PS1 era, when people thought that the first Metal Gear game was as realistic-looking as they come.

          "description": "Maid in Japan\nIt appears that the fanservice fanatics over at CyGames are getting set to launch a brand new franchise, following on from its application for \"Akiba Maid War\" with The Japan Trademark Association.\nCygames, renown for cutesy cult franchises such as Granblue Fantasy, The Idolmaster, and Dragalia Lost, was granted the trademark on May 10, picking up the domain name for the property soon after. No details were revealed as to the context of Akiba Maid War, with only a simple logo released so far. As noted by Gematsu, the Japanese text \"Akiba Meido Sensou\" is a fun pun, as \"Meido\" is phonetically pronounced \"Maid\" but as written is the word for \"Underworld.\"\nThat's all well and good, CyGames, but frankly, I just want my tea and biscuits. Failing that, I just want to dress up as a maid. No doubt we will hear more about Akiba Maid War as the year progresses, as it's getting to be about that time. Maybe it'll be a great third-person console adventure, maybe it will be a garbage gacha mobile game. Until Cygames is ready to spill the tea, it could go either way. Schrodinger's Maid, if you will. (You won't.)\nThe post Bring your best tea tray and clompy shoes to the AKIBA MAID WAR! appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alongside the sunshine and blue skies, more games showcases are cropping up for the annual airing of game showcases, like the Future Games Show.\nGamesRadar+ announced today that the Future Games Show will air on Saturday, June 11 at 3 p.m. ET / noon PT. The show will air on Twitch, YouTube, and several other major streaming locales.\nhttps://twitter.com/FutureGamesShow/status/1527334286893801488\nThe show advertises it will have \"over 60 minutes\" of trailers, world premieres, and surprises in store.\nAre you ready for the summer?\nIt's the middle of May, just a few weeks out now from June, and already the month is getting lined up. Several showcases are already slotting their times in for the second weekend in June, kicking off with Summer Game Fest Live on June 9.\nThe sister show of Future, PC Gamer's PC Gaming Show, airs the following day (June 12) at 3:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 p.m. PT. And on the same day as Future Games Show, both the Guerrilla Collective and the Wholesome Games Direct will show off some games too.\nXbox and Bethesda, meanwhile, air their joint showcase on June 12 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT.\nOther major platforms and publishers, including Sony, Nintendo, and Square Enix, have yet to formally announce their plans. Several signs are pointing to some Final Fantasy news in June though, so we can expect to see something from the publisher then.\nAll of these streams and announcements fall under the same week we'd usually be heading out for E3, even though there's no E3 this year. The ESA confirmed it's fully sitting out this year, planning to return in 2023. The Summer Game Fest has meanwhile risen in the interim, and will at least be kicking off the summer festivities. It's not a normal year, but it hasn't been for a while now. At least we know one weekend in June will still be crammed full of video game showcases.\nThe post The Future Games Show will air its summer showcase on June 11 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher Leonardo Interactive and developer Smallthings Studios have announced a brand new game starring one of the point 'n' click genre's formative home computing heroes, Simon the Sorcerer!\nNeither a remaster nor a remake, Simon the Sorcerer Origins will be a prequel to the original 1993 Adventure Soft classic, as a rebellious young man falls under the tutelage of his friend, guide, and mentor, Calypso. Simon the Sorcerer Origins will retain the exploratory, point 'n' click gameplay of yore, complete with item puzzles, a wide cast of characters, and a comical, tongue-in-cheek script.\nCheck out an early development trailer below, courtesy of IGN.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTnK19Ezu7Y\nAccording to Leonardo Interactive, this officially licensed prequel features slick, cartoonish artworks, and sporting dynamic transitions that allow gameplay to flow seamlessly in and out of cutscenes. As players explore Simon's newfound powers, they will learn of the events that led up to his mythical 1990s escapade.\nFresh off of Ron Gibert's recent Return to Monkey Island announcement, point 'n click fans will be stoked to hear of Simon's return. Hopefully, this brand-new adventure will capture the magic and enchantment of its old-school roots. Simon the Sorcerer Origins will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Point ‘n’ click hero preps for comeback in Simon the Sorcerer Origins appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, Nacon announced that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the sequel have been canceled, with Solar Crown now solely in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and, perhaps surprisingly, Nintendo Switch. Perhaps the most ambitious TDU title to date, Solar Crown hopes to fully replicate a digital version of Hong Kong Island as the backdrop for its polished, high-speed racing action.\nTest Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is currently in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

The next-gen version, which should bring The Witcher 3 onto PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as its own version, is planned to release in Q4 2022.\nhttps://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1527299944834510854\nThe next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has slid around a fair bit. It moved into 2022 and then, most recently, slid into an undefined window. Alongside that news, CD Projekt also confirmed that it was bringing development in-house, rather than over at Saber Interactive. The team at Saber had previously handled The Witcher 3's Nintendo Switch port.\nSomething ends, something begins\nCD Projekt had this next-gen version in the works alongside Cyberpunk 2077 next-gen. The latter launched in February, in a surprising reveal and release event.\nBut while Cyberpunk 2077 is a fairly new game, it's been seven years since the launch of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It's a massive game, but it's fair to say that Witcher fans would probably like to see how the world looks on newer hardware.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOnpO5A7bAU\nAnticipation for new Witcher content is likely also higher than usual, thanks to the recent announcement of a new Witcher in development. The next step in The Witcher universe is being made in Unreal Engine 5 at CD Projekt Red.\nThe studio has also been strictly calling it a new saga. With a new step forward in the world, it'd be nice to have a next-gen version of Geralt's journey too. The old witcher got a nice send-off with Blood and Wine, and it'd be nice to re-experience that.\nWe'll see what CD Projekt Red's got in store as the year rolls on.\nThe post The Witcher 3 next-gen versions will arrive in Q4 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before the sequel comes out and likely does the same, we can enjoy this God of War Simpsons mod.\nCreated as part of Omega Fantasy's Patreon, the mod swaps out Kratos for Homer, and his son Atreus for Bart — with Flanders butting in as \"The Stranger.\" The gameplay is effectively the same, but you get the new character models (including a reworked [Wonder]bat instead of Kratos' Leviathan Axe). YouTuber ToastedShoes also managed to hire voice actors to add a finishing touch, which really makes the below video worth watching. They even completely change the script to make it more like one of those \"trilogy/what if\" Simpsons episodes.\nThe voices are done by Benjamin Rudman (Homer), June Briar (Bart), and Brock Baker (Flanders), and I have to say, the performances make it. You can't really sell Flanders fighting Homer without some sort of \"diddly\" rant, and the relationship between Homer and Bart is even funnier with them talking directly to each other.\nA lot of people in the YouTube comments are calling for a Peter Griffin versus the Chicken mod — and with plenty of Peter soundalikes out there, I think someone can make it happen.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu031MIoZpM\nThe post A God of War Simpsons mod with added voice acting is chef kiss appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rumored Remake Release Rumors\nWhile developer Naughty Dog is yet to even officially confirm rumors of a remake of its magnum opus, The Last of Us, it seems that whispers in the wind are already pointing to the possibility that the revamped survival horror title will come crawling onto modern platforms as soon as 2022.\nAt least that's the world according to GamesBeat reporter and known spoiler Jeff Grubb, who suggested as such on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. Citing his own sources, Grubb noted that he was \"pretty confident\" that a Last of Us remake is already pushing completion, and is likely to launch in the 2022 holiday season. It's well worth noting that Grubb's estimation matches that of fellow leak machine Tom Henderson, who has also previously speculated a Holiday 2022 launch on the PS5 platform.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bMYTkMzk\nFirst inklings of a remake of Naughty Dog's highly acclaimed 2013 adventure surfaced in April 2021, following a consolidation of studios within Sony's gaming division. It is believed that Sony pulled its San Diego-based “Visual Art Service Group” team off of the project, which led to unrest among its members, some of which referenced The Last of Us remake in a report to Bloomberg.\nAround the same time, Sony Bend — who had reportedly begun work on a Days Gone sequel — was pulled off of the project in order to further assist Naughty Dog with its other major IP, Uncharted. These incidents led to a period of turmoil for many working within Sony's gaming division who felt that they were being pushed away from their own projects and ideas to essentially assist in the development of \"cash cows.\"\nIn addition to the rumored remake, Naughty Dog is also currently developing the multiplayer component of The Last of Us Part II, and is assisting in the production of HBO's TV adaptation.\nThe Last of Us PS5 remake is reportedly likely to be released in 2022 [VGC]\nThe post The Last of Us Remake could be launching as soon as late 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We had the gem that was NORCO earlier this year, Monkey Island is coming back, and now another beautiful-looking adventure game has been announced and subsequently landed on my Steam wishlist. It's called Phonopolis, a political narrative title developed by Czech indie collective Amanita Design, best known for Machinarium, Botanicula, and Samorost.\nIn Phonopolis, players will take on the role of Felix, a young man living in a dystopian city that is threatened by the imminent rule of an authoritarian ruler. As Felix seems to be the only one who is aware of the looming danger of the situation, he tasks himself with stopping the leader and saving his fellow citizens.\nh…",

          "description": "A gorgeous, Ghibli-style sim\nI'm always chasing the high of my first playthrough of Stardew Valley. It's among my favorite games of all time, and something comforting I reach for during tough times, so having other titles to add to that arsenal is always a plus. We could always use more Stardew-likes. That's not a saying yet, but it needs to be. It would make looking for new games a whole lot easier. For now, though, I have seen one new game on the horizon that will satisfy my need for a cozy life sim: Spirittea.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi4GmC4v6sI\nThe logline for Spirittea is Stardew Valley meets Spirited Away, which alone is enough to make me buy this game.\nIn this upcoming PC game, you'll play as a character who arrives in a beautiful rural town, where you meet NPCs to befriend and can partake in lots of hobbies like bug catching or karaoke — but then, of course, you accidentally drink from a cup of tea that allows you to see the spirit world! With the help of a friendly cat, you're also tasked with helping to run the local bathhouse, helping soothe its ghostly patrons rather than them haunting others. Good thing I have some time to prepare before Spirittea comes out, because if I had access to this game right now, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't see the sun for a good while there.\nSpirittea is coming to us from developer Cheesemaster Games, and is published by No More Robots, who are best known for publishing titles like Hypno Space Outlaw and Descenders. Like ConcernedApe (aka Eric Barone), the beloved developer behind Stardew Valley, Cheesemaster is actually just one guy, Dan Beckerton. Like Barone, Beckerton is extremely passionate about his project, and has spent a great deal of time working on it.\nI personally can't wait to check out all of the amazing work that he's put in, so I'll be looking forward to Spirittea's release, whenever that will be.\nThe post Spirittea is a delicious mix of Stardew Valley and Spirited Away appeared first on Destructoid.",

Already available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, the \"Academy Juvenile RPG\" will be available to purchase via Steam and the Epic Games Store from June 23.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFT5p6LdcwA\nFor those less inclined, The Caligula Effect 2 is the follow-up to the 2016 PS Vita original, and details the exploits of a party of fresh-faced teens known as \"The Go-Home Club.\" These kids are trapped within the unnervingly idyllic walls of \"Redo\" an alternate universe where all of your regrets are undone, your mistakes rectified, and your high school years played out in perpetuity, sans any end-of-day bell.\nExplore the \"perfect world\" of Redo, befriend your fellow denizens, learn of their true selves and pasts, and you'll soon begin to understand why it's the flaws, mistakes, and errors of judgment that, ultimately, make us who we truly are.\nOn PlayStation and Switch, The Caligula Effect 2 launched to mixed reviews, (airing mostly on the positive side). While many critics and players enjoyed the sequel's premise, combat, world, and cast of characters, some found that the sequel fell into the typical JRPG pitfalls of featuring too much narrative padding and an emphasis on The Grind in regards to its dungeon crawling.\nThe Caligula Effect 2 launches June 23 on PC (via Steam and EGS).

Japanese outfit Inti Creates has revealed some new tidbits regarding the action-packed sequel, ahead of its anticipated launch on July 28.\nFirst and foremost, it is to be noted that this second mainline sequel will see the Azure Striker Gunvolt series receive a fully scripted English voiceover for the first time in series history. Popular voice actors Sean Chiplock, Kelly Baskin, and Ryan Colt Levy will step into the metallic shoes of Gunvolt, Kirin, and Black Badge respectively, while singer Diana Garnet will portray overseer Lumen, aka \"The Muse.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heDpzWIqo54\nInti Creates also offered a first look at the sequel's unique \"Story Mode+\" option, which will see the entire gameplay out in real-time, seamlessly posting plot details and dialogue directly into the action, without the need for pausing, cutscenes, or any other interruptions. This mode will surely be popular among budding speedrunners, while delivering a non-stop take on the sci-fi action for all other players.\nFinally, Limited Run Games revealed that it has opened pre-orders on physical editions of Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 for Nintendo Switch. PhysEd fans can bag themselves a standard boxed copy of the title for $39.99 USD, or splash out on the Collector's Edition, which includes an official art book, double CD soundtrack, and a cute \"Dogvolt\" keychain for $79.99. Both editions are available to pre-order now from the Limited Run Games store.\nOh, and speaking of soundtracks, be sure to check out the music video below, featuring the Japanese voice of Lumen, Megu Sakuragawa, performing one of the sequel's many compositions \"Traces.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSeSZYcVo8E&t\nThe post Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 will debut an English voice cast appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The first premium membership skin is underwhelming at best\nThe Pokemon Unite membership program is now live, and sadly, it wasn't really tweaked from its original leaked incarnation.\nNow live worldwide, the Pokemon Unite membership program (called the \"Unite Club\") costs $9.99 per month, which is a rather large disconnect compared to what other subscriptions offer. Here's what you get:\nA \"first time membership benefit\" of a trainer outfit\n40 gems a day (more on that later)\nOne premium skin a month (more on that in a moment)\nAdditional unite licenses each week (read: a few more \"free rotation\" characters, which is useless if you own them all)\nTrial Holowear (skins) each week\nSpecial portrait frames and speech bubbles\n10% off new fashion items\nDon't all cheer at once!\nNaturally, these sorts of programs (like a similar one for Fortnite) come with a marquee monthly skin. And really, this is one of the most front-facing disappointing aspects of the Pokemon Unite membership. Like many Unite skins, this Greedent Holowear outfit can barely be considered a tweak from the original model.\nAlso, note this proviso: \"you will receive 40 Aeos gems daily as a login bonus.\" Digging into the FAQ, it's important to note that even the membership program is a method of getting you to log in every day: \"If you log in and forget to claim the bonus or if the bonus resets without you logging in, you will not be able to receive Aeos gems for the missed day.\" The Fortnite membership service by comparison provides the equivalent of $10 worth of V-Bucks no questions asked, on a monthly basis (that isn't drip-fed).\nOne more caveat to keep in mind: \"Club membership benefits can only be received on the platform used to join.\"\nYou can find a full FAQ on the membership here, if you are planning on getting it.\nThe post Pokemon Unite launches its low value $10-per-month membership appeared first on Destructoid.",

Interested psychopaths can dive into the weird and violent world of futuristic game show Death Jamboree, battling it out with a variety of post-apocalyptic contestants, all under the watchful and highly excitable eyes of hosts Queen B and Bryan Zemeckis. Check out Deathverse's wild world in the gameplay trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx58XTnmjOs\nSet in 2026, as the planet rises from the aftermath of global conflict, Deathverse: Let it Die sees a populace seeking to quench its bloodlust through Death Jamboree's consistent delivery of extreme violence. The show's contestants — each sporting unique looks, skills, and abilities — utilize sci-fi weaponry, ethereal powers, and sometimes just good, old-fashioned right hooks in order to mash the opposition and take their place among the pantheon of Death Jamboree champions.\nIf you fancy your chances against a roster of retro-future warriors in the kill-or-be-killed world of Death Jamboree, then all you need do is pre-load the Deathverse: Let it Die module on either PS4 or PS5 ahead of the server's launch, and you'll be good to go. The chaos kicks off on May 28 at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST until 19:00 PT / 22:00 ET / 03:00 BST. Of course, as the beta is designed specifically to stress test the servers, it may be host to various bugs and outages.

The competitive team sports game will go live next week on May 25 as a free-to-play title.\nThe action kicks off on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, as well as Xbox Series X|S and PS5 via backward compatibility. Roller Champions will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna, though it'll be at a later date.\nThe roller derby action sports game Roller Champions was first announced by Ubisoft a few years ago. Ever since, it's been rolling through a few technical tests and delays, popping up every now and then before disappearing into the night. Now, at least, the high-octane roller bash is finally debuting.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUAWz0jH1A4\nThe general flow of Roller Champions is two teams of roller skaters competing to reach five points. They pick up these points by racing laps around the arena with the ball in their possession, cashing them in when they dunk it in the goal. There's wallriding, tackling, and general action-sports moves to cause chaos along the way.\n\nPush it to the brink\nIt looks like Roller Champions will also have the features of most modern F2P games. Play online matches in quick play alone or with pals. There are maps to unlock and time-limited modes, as well as cosmetics to customize your avatar's appearance. And of course, seasons with special cosmetics linked to them. The kickoff season starts the day Roller Champions launches.\nThe nice part is that Roller Champions isn't just free-to-play, but also cross-play and cross-progression, so it's easy enough to hop and check it out on any platform. There's also some social hangout areas, with practice rinks and minigames. It's a bit of a sudden surprise, but Ubisoft's Roller Champions looks to finally put some wheels down in the arena next week.\nThe post Ubisoft’s Roller Champions rolls out next week on May 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game's director Yoji Fujito notes that people shouldn't be worried about that happening \"anytime soon,\" and that \"higher-ups\" are informing Fujito and his team to \"continue on\" with the game.\nIt's good news for fans to get short-term confirmation, but it also seems like the game isn't even on the chopping block at this time. So just how long will it go on? Well, only Square Enix management can say. But even if it ended next week, 20 years is quite the run!\nAt the moment, the two MMOs seem like an important part of Square Enix's portfolio. While Final Fantasy XIV is obviously more successful, the publisher sees value in their internal IP, and generally treats the Final Fantasy series with reverence (barring some port job quality control), and plays the long game.

The tweet reads, \"Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus.\" The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called \"An Explosive Start.\" A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name \"Excellent work, Agent.\"\nWith the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.\nPlayStation Plus' revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.\nWhich classic PlayStation games would you like to see with trophy support?

          "description": "Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. \nMarvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. \n\n\n“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” \n\nAt launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. \n\nBeginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. \nIn regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. \nAre you excited for Marvel Snap? Let us know in the comments below!",

This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.\n\n\nLike the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. \nThe studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. \nThe first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more.

          "description": "It took more than 10 years, but Shinji Mikami says his original vision for Tango Gameworks is finally coming to life.\nMikami established Tango in 2010 after nearly two decades at Capcom, directing games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4, and a few years contracting for Platinum Games, where he directed Vanquish. His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.\n“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry. When you’re in your 30s, you have the right balance – you’re energetic and have your ego a…",

          "description": "Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. \nThis news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: \nNew Game Announcement!\npic.twitter.com/TIHbrUqmOK\nMay 18, 2022\nAs you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. \nElsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. \nIn the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this new Marvel game is?

Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.\nAlong with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.\nIf you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures.

          "description": "Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. \nThe long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: \n“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” \nTo soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. \nNacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.\" You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. \nTest Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. \n2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.",

          "description": "Ubisoft’s roller derby-inspired Roller Champions finally has a release date, and its inaugural season is only a week away.\nOn May 25, the free-to-play multiplayer title goes live. The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. \n\n\nAs players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. \nRoller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. \nRoller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, \"Onto the Icy Blue.\"\n“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” \n\n\nWe won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. \nAfter watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game.

As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. \nThe last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. \nAll of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer.

Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). \n\n\nYou can also check out the official poster below:\nShe-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. \nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June. \nWhat do you think of this first look at She-Hulk?

          "description": "Today’s Dead by Daylight 6th Anniversary livestream brought a lot of exciting announcements, but none were stranger or more surprising than the reveal of Hooked on You. This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.\nIf you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. \n\n\n“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”\nHooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.",

According to Nintendo Life, many projects are in the works, from those already announced to undisclosed titles. Ultimately, the report revealed over 30 games are in the works, including, but not limited to, new ports and remasters. \nThe full report, which can be read here, categorizes the upcoming games and provides clear definitions for each:\nImmersive Core: Titles that have the deepest gameplay and the most hours of content. Examples include our key sports franchises (like PGA 2K and NBA 2K) as well as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption (to name a few). \nIndependent: Externally developed Private Division releases. \nMobile: Any title released on a mobile platform.\nMid-core: Titles that are either an arcade title (like WWE Battlegrounds) or games that have many hours of gameplay, but not to the same extent as an immersive core title. \nNew iterations of prior releases: This includes ports and remastered titles. Sequels would not fall into this category.\nMoreover, a pipeline table in the document states Take-Two is developing 24 immersive core games, including The Quarry for June 10, Marvel's Midnight Suns later this year, Kerbal Space Program 2 (PC) in early 2023, and NBA2K23, PGA Tour 2K23, and WWE 2K23 next year. Ten independent games, 20 mobile games like the GTA Trilogy in 2023, 7 mid-core games, including the long-awaited Tales from the Borderlands sequel, and eight new iterations of prior releases are also on the way. Fans of Take-Two's many development studios undoubtedly have a lot to look forward to. \nIt's hard to guess the future for some of these categories, but what ports and remasters are you anticipating? Perhaps we'll get to play a modernized Bully port! Let us know what you're positing in the comments below! \n[Source: Nintendo Life]",

Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.\nCreative director Nate Simpson explained on the project's forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: \n“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” \n\n\nLike its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. \nKerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.\nUnfortunately, Kerbal isn't the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.",

But the news for Warner Bros.' brawler doesn't stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.\nLooney Toons' Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo's Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week's alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won't make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.\nA later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you're not able to get into the closed alpha, you'll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. \nIf you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game's website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.",

The first-party PS5 and PS4 lineup looks great, even if we likely will never get first-party games day-and-date on PS Plus a la Xbox Game Pass. I’m especially excited to see newer titles like Death Stranding Director’s Cut, Demon's Souls, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the list because it means that yes, while we won’t be getting big releases immediately on PS Plus, we might not have to wait too long for them to hit the subscription service. \nThe third-party lineup isn’t nearly as exciting but it does include some bangers like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Control: Ultimate Edition, and Red Dead Redemption 2.

If you're a PC player, good thing the modding community is particularly generous with its wacky experiments. PC Gamer reports that a new mod allows Tarnished to group up with some of their favorite NPCs and bosses so that The Lands Between is a little easier and less lonely to navigate. \nSPOILERS FOR NPC & BOSS NAMES/PHASES BELOW\nSatoshi98 is the modder behind this cool pseudo-party system. The new feature is kind of like spirit summoning. As PC Gamer aptly points out, it's akin to Skyrim's follower mechanic, meaning that your party members will likely stay with you even after defeating the big bads of a specific point of interest. Moreover, the various characters were rebalanced to fit Elden Ring's exploratory loop and include, Melina, Sellen, Millicent, Ranni, Blaidd, Malenia (and her Rot form!), Radagon, Morgott, Godfrey, and Maliketh among many others. You can purchase these followers from Miriel at the Church of Vows. \nHead here to see what else Satoshi98's mod entails and be sure to read about why I think From Software's Next Game Should Prioritize Coop.\n[Source: PC Gamer]\nDoes this mod pique your interest?

Firaxis, the team behind the classic strategy franchise, XCOM, is helming the project. Midnight Suns was our cover game last summer and looks to tell a darker story within the Marvel universe while also mixing Firaxis' turn-based strategy mechanics with deck building. According to Push Square, a Korean games listing revealed the Midnight Suns' rating, meaning a release date might be on the horizon.\nPush Square posits that we might get more Midnight Suns news during this year's Summer Games Fest. And since we're coming up to the second half of 2022, this might not be misguided speculation. You can click here to see the game's rating for yourself. Hopefully, this means we won't be seeing another delay.\nMarvel’s Midnight Suns chronicles the exploits of a powerful sorceress named Lilith, who unleashes an army of demons upon the world.  The Midnight Suns, a group of several fan-favorite heroes, including Wolverine, Blade, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider, led by you, The Hunter, must join forces and thwart Lilith's plans.\nMarvel's Midnight Suns is slated for a 2022 release and will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\nDo you think the game is coming soon?
