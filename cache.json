          "description": "In the Zone.\nLauded on its original 2007 release, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow Of Chornobyl dropped players into a stark world, filled with effective horror and precision combat. It spawned two sequels, both of which refined and improved on the model of their predecessor. Ukraine-based GSC Game World’s Legends Of The Zone bundle squeezes all three expansive adventures onto Switch with modern optimisations and stable visual performance, although each title is also available as a standalone purchase. It’s worth noting that this is the series' first time on consoles (with the PlayStation versions released back in March), which makes the competency of these ports all the more impressive.\nTaking inspiration from the 1971 Russian novel Roadside Picnic, Shadows Of Chornobyl is set in the irradiated wilderness of the Zone. Decades after repopulation efforts, a second Chornobyl disaster occurs, turning residents into mutated creatures and littering the countryside with deadly elemental anomalies. The haunting and oppressive atmosphere of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film adaptation Stalker, is prevalent throughout. The Zone always feels like an alien landscape, or a bad dream.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's a decent number (if not a particularly high one by Nintendo's standards), but what makes this figure so special is that it's higher than TTYD's lifetime sales on GameCube — which sales-tracking website VGChartz puts at 1.91 million.

Nintendo has played a bit fast and loose when it comes to announcing sales for new titles, so it's not known at this time whether the figures for Echoes of Wisdom just cover the six days between its release and the end of the six-month period, or if Nintendo has simply pulled the most recent data available.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We'd also predicted a similar shift with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Pokémon Sword and Shield, but alas, it seems as though both Pokémon generations are selling at a fairly similar rate at the moment (with Scarlet and Violet enjoying slightly higher sales), leading to a bit of a stalemate.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.\nRead more",

And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.\nIn fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.\nRead more",

It's an \"innovative urban walking simulator\" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. \nRead more",

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended?

This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You’d be a monster for it, of course, but it’s nice to have options.\nRead more",

That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.\n Read more",

          "description": "Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

They're always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into \"Adventure Points\", used to \"unlock\" books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy's magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game's religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at \"ancient history\" for a while. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help!

Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity.

If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution.

          "description": "New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it's no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.\nIt's a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ubisoft Montpellier's Beyond Good And Evil 2 has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of \"vapourware\", while staunchly refusing to become \"abandonware\". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the \"triple-A\" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children? \r\n \nRead more",

However, several rumors have become available online, indicating the items that will be present in the promo.\n\n\nComplete list of EA FC 25 Centurions promo players (leaks)\n\n\nSo far, the leaks have revolved around the icons. These are unique cards of former legends, and Centurions will introduce a new version. Here's the list of available icons that are rumored to appear as part of the upcoming promo.\n\n\n\nHernan Crespo\n\n\nGianluca Zambrotta\n\n\nJuan Sebastian Veron\n\n\nPavel Nedved\n\n\nDavid Beckham\n\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger\n\n\nRuud Van Nistelrooy\n\n\nEdwin Van der Sar\n\n\nSol Campbell\n\n\nMichael Laudrup\n\n\nFoudy\n\n\nFranck Ribery\n\n\n\nThe list of the icons looks pretty stacked, but we have no idea about their overall ratings or playstyles. That could be a big difference maker, and it's more than likely that EA Sports could add separate playstyles on the Centurions version.\n\n\nSo far, we have rumors of another special card for the recent Ballon d'Or winner, Rodri. Interestingly, the Centurions promo could feature several Ballon d'Or nominees, so that team of cards could be amazing as well. The list consists of the world's most prominent footballers, so it will be interesting to find out who makes it to the promo.\n\n\nThe Centurions promo could be a two-team affair as well, although that remains to be seen for the time-being. Additionally, it will be fun to have a couple of Centurions Icons as SBCs.

Interestingly, there wasn't any mention in the patch notes about any work being done on XP rewards after finishing a game. Sadly, several players are now finding the grind pretty hard due to what seems like an unintended change on Treyarch's part.\n\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops 6 XP bug explained\n\n\nThe November 4 update introduced some major rework if you have gone through the patch notes. Only the Face Off modes were targeted for improper XP rewards, and those who played would know exactly how easy it was to farm XP in that mode.\n\n\nThe same bit of the patch might have accidentally resulted in the other modes giving out nerfed XP rewards. I have already noticed that the amount of XP you get from Nuketown is no longer the same. But as it turns out, I am not the only one, and a few other members on Reddit have already reported on the same issue.\n\n\n\n\nOfficially, there has been no reduction in the amount of XP you get after finishing matches in Call of Duty Black Ops 6. I haven't noticed any obvious issue with the XP you get in the Zombies mode. But multiplayer definitely has some issues as of writing.\n\n\nSince there's no mention of such a change in the patch notes, it's most likely a bug. In that case, I would expect it to be fixed pretty quickly so that we can all get back to our usual rate of camo grinding. Until then, prepare to expect a lot of frustration and longer waiting time to unlock the different camos, especially those that are unlocked at higher prestige levels.\n\n\nAs for camos, you can unlock plenty of them across the Zombies and Multiplayer modes. Here's the complete list of all skins that can be obtained for free by completing different achievements. \n\nThe post Has Call of Duty Black Ops 6 nerfed XP from games? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Being on a voice chat helps, but a simple ping reduces the need for words between you and your buddies. Let's look at how the system works on both PC and consoles.\n\n\nHow to use the Ping function in PUBG\n\n\nWhether you're playing on a PC or console, the core function of Ping is the same. It helps your buddy see something they haven't but you have. To ping, you can use the Middle Mouse button, and the object/enemy/location will be highlighted on the map.\n\n\nOn consoles, you'll need to aim at the object/enemy and press the RB/Right Bumper button to mark. While the system is easier to manage on a PC with a mouse, those on controllers can make good use of it if they know what they're doing.\n\n\nImage via KRAFTON\n\n\nThe ping system has been improved in previous updates, which lets you mark almost anything in PUBG. Here are the three main uses of the ping inside a game.\n\n\n\nMark enemies - This makes eliminating enemies easier, as your ally will know precisely where to look. This is even more useful if someone does the spotting with a sniper rifle, as it's easier to spot from a distance and alert your friends.\n\n\nMark objects - This can include any type of loot and chests. You can also mark airdrop crates that often include valuable gear and consumables.\n\n\nMark a location—This is highly useful if you're not on voice chat and playing with strangers. Pinging a location on the map will help you let your team know where you're planning to go.\n\n\n\nThat's pretty much it when it comes to PUBG's ping system. In some tight contests, they can become a big difference-maker while securing a valuable drop or finishing off an enemy from a distance.\n\nThe post How to Ping objects and enemies in PUBG appeared first on Destructoid.",

Steam shows the game as \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" for all reviews, so it definitely proves the wait was worth it in the end.\n\n\nAs a survival horror game, Silent Hill 2 is dripping with mood, atmosphere, anguish, sorrow, and grotesque denizens. What it's not dripping with, however, is a potassium-based snack. This is where Nexus Mods user Stevebg23 comes to the rescue with a mod that changes the pistol James finds into a large banana.\n\n\nImage via Stevebg23/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, you'll also find that the lead pipe – a classic of the original 2001 release, many would say – has also been changed. Now, the player will find themselves beating the snot out of monsters with a giant spoon.\n\n\nBecause of reasons, I guess\n\n\nThe reason for the \"Banana Gun and Spoon Pipe\" mod is simple: the creator \"always wanted to have a silly mod,\" and this is the result. They also reassure us you can reload the skin of the gun, and that the spoon is \"shiny and silvery and nice to handle against the hordes of evil coming your way.\" Comforting to know.\n\n\nDespite its seriousness, anyone who's played the original Silent Hill 2 knows the developer was not afraid to get a little silly. The infamous dog ending showed a kind of light-hearted irreverence for this drab horror experience that many of us were absolutely not expecting the first time around.\n\n\nOf course, the game is still the same, even if you do swap out the pistol for a healthy-looking, half-peeled banana. It's nice to know James is getting his vitamins while battling the inner demons of his guilty conscience.\n\nThe post Here’s a Silent Hill 2 mod that turns the weapons into a banana and a large spoon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dragon Age: The Veilguard might be a single-player experience, but you rarely play alone, and that's only possible thanks to your companions.\n\n\nHowever, your available number of companions will always be more than your squad size, so you'll have to make some critical decisions. While you can shuffle and switch your party members inside the game, it can't be done whenever you want. Hence, it's crucial to understand how you can change your party composition.\n\n\nWhen can you change your party members in Dragon Age: The Veilguard\n\n\nThere are two moments when you can specifically alter your party composition in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It can be done right at the beginning of a fresh quest when you're about to leave your Lighthouse. Once you've selected the pursuit and its location, you can access the \"Change Party\" option. It will show your two existing party members, and you can change any/both of them based on your preferences.\n\n\nThe only exception to this is that some quests have predetermined team members. In some instances, you'll lose access to certain members, but that mostly happens in the endgame, so you don't have to stress about that in the beginning.\n\n\nImage via Bioware\n\n\nYou can also change the composition of your party at Beacons. You'll come across beacons while traveling the lands, and they're instrumental as they allow you to fast travel. But your fallen teammates will also be available at your beacons, where you can \"Gather Your Party.\" Not only can you recall all your fallen party members, but you can also shuffle the composition.\n\n\nDo note that your available companions will gradually increase as you complete more quests in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The main campaign has three different acts, and there is additional content like side quests, Faction quests, and more. All your companions also have their own story arcs, so there's plenty to explore and complete.\n\nThe post How to change your companions in Dragon Age: The Veilguard appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty Black Ops 6 local multiplayer is something many fans want as it's been a part of the series for decades. Playing against your friends or with them in co-op on the couch is a memory many cherish and would like to resume in 2024 and beyond. \n\n\nIs Call of Duty Black Ops 6 split-screen-capable with friends?\n\n\nThankfully, you can play both the zombies mode and multiplayer with split-screen functionality. There's a catch, however. PS4, Xbox One, and PC Call of Duty Black Ops 6 players can't use split-screen and are only able to play with one player at all times. Only those on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S can play a round of Team Deathmatch with a mate on the couch with split-screen. Simply connect the second controller and have them press A or the cross button at the lobby. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe positive is that the split-screen covers the entire screen with no cut-off sections. It's fully 16:9. It doesn't seem like you can play competitively against each other, however. I've tried to start a local multiplayer match under the \"Private Match\" mode and it didn't connect a second controller.\n\n\nDoes Call of Duty Black Ops 6 need to connect online?\n\n\nUnfortunately, you'll need to always be online while playing Call of Duty Black Ops 6, even for the single-player campaign. This means that LAN has become obsolete. At least, some form of Black Ops 6 local multiplayer is supported through split-screen.\n\n\nDo you need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass to play Call of Duty Black Ops 6 online?\n\n\nIf you're playing the game on PS4 and PS5, you'll need at least PlayStation Plus Essential to access Call of Duty Black Ops 6's multiplayer matchmaking. This is the same with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S users with Xbox Game Pass Core and up. Thankfully, both of these services come with free games each month. November 2024, for example, has Ghostwire Tokyo and Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 included with your subscription. \n\nThe post Can you play Call of Duty Black Ops 6 with Local Multiplayer? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

A navíc, viděl jsem dabovanou verzi a rozhodně byla méně zábavná než tři minuty ukázek v původním znění, které jsem viděl taky. (Ilča 60 %)",
