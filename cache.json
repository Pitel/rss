The lack of being able to quickly and easily remap buttons in many Nintendo first-party games is just a start, but there are often mechanics that require multiple button prompts, or simple commands that require you to press different buttons per game.\nIt's not an across-the-board problem, but we know Nintendo can — and should — do better. Both Sony and Microsoft have their own accessibility controllers: the PS Access Controller and the Xbox Adaptive Controller. They're pricey, but that's still more than Nintendo can say.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I think we might be nearing the point where there are Too Many Retro Zeldalikes, and specifically Too Many Link’s Awakealikes – recent candidates include Isles Of Sea And Sky and Blossom Tales - but I’m definitely willing to go adventuring with Castaway, in which you are a spaceman called Martin who has crashlanded on an island’s worth of gently rounded, 8-bit scenery. \nMartin’s goal is to rescue his pet dog, which doesn’t sound like it’ll take too long – the “concise and delightful” story mode boasts just three bosses. But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials. Link’s Awakening with a sort of Bloody Palace component? Yeah, I’ll take that.\n Read more",

I hadn't heard of it before and am quite interested, partly because the game sports some wonderfully mangled and colourful dystopian maps, and partly because it's a story of immigrants trying to find their way to an inevitably deceptive \"shining city of progress\", rather than the typical Chosen One fare.\nYour family specifically are afflicted by a fatal disease. Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to \"get your hands dirty\", \"rise from the bottom\" and become some sort of absolute bastard.

They are sure to be swiftly rebuked by their fellows for playing dice with fate, those still of sound mind rightly afeared that the name may echo through the brine and tickle the ears of the dread captain himself. On the seas he calls kingdom, Noctilus is without equal, without mercy, and utterly without hesitation. For what has a dead man left to fear?\nHe has but one fatal flaw; he is deathly afraid of ever leaving his comfortable ship to touch ‘pon the verdant grass of land. I intend to honour this.

You want to make something of yourself, but it's about a regular person managing his life, not some unlikely \"adventurer\", whatever that means.

Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children.

Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income.

Genuinely, I've been humiliated on this count in RPS morning meetings, with certain \"colleagues\" whose names rhyme with \"Malice Knell\" making references I don't understand and laughing at my expression of hurt and confusion. My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don't need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.\r\n\n\r\n\"'Reality' stuff is huge now, and it's not just reality TV,\" says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. \"It's any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media.

Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.\r\n \nRead more",

Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed.

It’s also, I’ll admit, overdue some consideration on RPS. Between the lack of cheap graphics cards among the desktop RTX 40 series, the year-and-a-bit that DLSS 3 has had to grow its compatible games library, and the Steam Deck reminding everyone that portable, low-end gaming can still be pleasurable, now seems like the RTX 4050’s time to shine.

The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE's Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition's (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.\nWell, Guerrilla's lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames's latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024.

If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral \"SpookTube\" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. \nEach video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of \"cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation\" and \"cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views\". Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here's how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success. \n Read more",

Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”\nZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb.

          "description": "Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.\nViking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.\nAlongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens.

You have to actively manage and maintain the play space itself for that to even be an option. Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.\nIt's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.\nI think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.\n \nRead more",

There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is.

          "description": "You know me and Soulslikes. We're not particularly best buddies most of the time. We've had a couple of successful outings over the years with the likes of Death's Door and Hollow Knight and company, but anything with pure FromSoft blood running through its veins has always left me cold. Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've griped before that Warhammer 40,000 Darktide hides satisfying challenges behind tedious grind, but another interesting challenge is easily missed and forgotten at the opposite end of the scale. Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun. She's quite bad, and that's quite fun.\nRead more",

After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.\nImportantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's.

The patch included a buff to fire tick rate, and Helldivers 2 players are turning to ash before they can react.\n\n\nThe recent update brought many new changes to the table. Weapons got rebalanced, enemy behavior was tweaked, and fixes were addressed. Nestled in the list of weapon changes was this particular line: Fire damage per tick increased by 50% (from all sources). For those who wanted the flamethrower to do more to Chargers (like me!), the fire buff in Helldivers 2 looks like good news. \n\n\nBut when it comes to damage, the door swings both ways.\n\n\nFire damage buff is turning Helldivers 2 players into …",

Regardless of the situation, muting others can make things easier to handle. Here's how to mute other players in Content Warning. \n\n\nHow to mute players in Content Warning\n\n\nIn Content Warning, you can find volume settings and mute options through the game's pause menu. Upon opening the menu, you'll find a list of players on the right side of your screen alongside a volume bar, which you can drag horizontally to change their volume. Muting someone requires dragging the volume bar's circle to the left.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThis menu will show every player in your game's lobby, even if you use mods to increase Content Warning's maximum player capacity. That way, if you want to mute one specific person, you can find them right in your pause menu. \n\n\nHow to change sound and volume settings in Content Warning\n\n\nIf you prefer muting yourself or want to switch to push-to-talk, you can do this through Content Warning's pause menu. By pausing the game, entering your settings, and choosing audio, you'll find various options for changing your microphone, swapping between push-to-talk and voice detection, and sliders for your volume. \n\n\nChanging your settings is especially useful if you accidentally have the wrong microphone enabled, want to press a key to activate your voice, or don't want players to hear you speak. It's also helpful if you have background noise and wish to mute yourself to spare your party members from hearing what's happening on your end.\n\nThe post Content Warning: How to mute players appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, if you repeatedly encounter it after trying these three tips, you may have to wait for the servers to recover. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce Human's season data error is primarily caused by an influx of players trying to join the game's servers during its beta testing periods. As Starry Studio continues developing the game and reopening it to the public, the sudden surge in players can overload the servers, leading to various issues. \n\n\nIn particular, attempting to play Once Human during peak hours can make servers more challenging to join, increasing the odds you'll encounter issues like the season data error. Sometimes, waiting for player counts to go down can help you log on more quickly.\n\n\nAnother alternative is waiting for a patch from the developers addressing this issue.

Swapping servers can solve this situation, but doing so is more challenging than pressing a quick world switch button. Here's how to change worlds in Once Human.\n\n\nHow to change worlds in Once Human\n\n\nThere are two ways to change worlds in Once Human:\n\n\n\nLocate a teleportation tower and change to another world.\n\n\nCreate a new character on a different game server.\n\n\n\nFinding a teleportation tower is the easiest way to change servers without losing progress.

          "description": "One of the best aspects of any life-sim game is the opportunity to customise your experience and appearance. Stardew Valley offers many options to do just that and included with update 1.6 was another option - Bobber styles. \n\n\nAs I recently admitted, to you but also to myself, I do enjoy a spot of fishing in Stardew Valley and one of the things I particularly enjoy about the exercise is choosing a cute Bobber.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are a total of 39 Bobber styles to unlock and in order to unlock all of them, players must catch a total of 76 different fish, which can be seen in the Collections tab of the menu (and the 5 legendary fish relatives from Extended Family). That’s all of the fish currently in Stardew Valley minus one, but more on that in just a second.\n\n\nYou begin the game with only the default Bobber style available to use and for every two new fish you catch, you unlock another Bobber style, which explains why the last fish you catch won’t count towards any further Bobber styles. While they don't do anything to change the experience of fishing itself, they do at least help you to express yourself in a small way while fishing.\n\n\nHow to change your Bobber style in Stardew Valley\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn order to select a new Bobber, head down to the beach and into Willy’s Fish Shop, which is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Once inside, go to the back right corner of the room and interact with the Bobber Machine. \n\n\nEvery possible option available to you will be shown here, including the default red and white Bobber that you start the game with. There are a number of very cute designs to choose from, including a rubber duck (my personal favorite), a Golden Animal Cracker, and a cat. \n\n\nYou can also choose to randomize your Bobber, which will result in a different Bobber appearing each time you cast your line. To do this, select the dice at the end of the regular options. \n\nThe post How to change your Bobber style in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

The highly anticipated title developed by Starry Studio and NetEase also enters a new open beta testing phase today, giving players a chance to check it out ahead of its Q3 2024 release later this year.\n\n\n\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, the world of Once Human is infested by an alien creature called Stardust. The player takes on the role of a Meta-Human able to survive the contamination and somehow use the powers of the Stardust. In classic open world survival game fashion, players can team up or go against other players as they collect resources, build, and fight over the land in Once Human.\n\n\nAnother impressive feat about the 9.9 million milestone is that Once Human is that it's exclusive to PC and mobile. Popularity for the shooter ballooned last month after a March beta test added a lot of the core features players were looking forward to in Once Human.\n\n\nThose interested in checking out Once Human can join the beta now on the official website.

Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Stellar Blade feature for behind-the-scenes details and new insight from Tae. \n[Source: Ruliweb]\nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch.

Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, \"We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.\" The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.\nStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta.\" You can learn more here.",

          "description": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is \"alive and well,\" according to Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch. He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. \nLast month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. \n\n\nNow, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. \n\"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this,\" Karch told the publication. \"It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.\" \nThat's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. \nFor more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays.

It sounds annoying, but to my surprise, it's made me enjoy the game even more than I already did.\nIt's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere.

Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.\nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. \n\"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,\" says Gearbox as part of its statement. \"The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.\"\nWhile Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  \nEmbracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.\nNine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. \n\n\nThe 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. \nNine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.",

The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. \nThis move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem.

After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.\nThe studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. \n\n\nThe studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.\n\nYellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a \"people first\" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, \"deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.\"\n\"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release\"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world.

          "description": "Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!\nPlease welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.\nScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.\nThis update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.\nThe Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.\nThe detailed list of improvements is available here.\nAs always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.\nGo grab it while it's hot — enjoy!\n>",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

          "description": "I was once the hottest new model on the street. Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town. The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
