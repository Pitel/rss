By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed.

That piece was actually an edited version of Gough's blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a \"blockage of the flow of love\".

A feel-good novelty story in the news! What many news outlets politely neglected to mention is that, to the delight and horror of the gathered crowds, Thor had a big ol' wank in front of everyone. Thankfully, one chronicler of modern English culture is brave enough to capture this moment. Yes, absolutely a walrus cracking one off is now in Duke Smoochem, that astonishing upcoming Duke Nukem 3D level made by Dan Douglas.\nRead more",

You're more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.\r\n\nThat sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.\r\n\nWhat are your gaming ambitions for 2023?

While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.\r\n\n\r\nPossibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.\r\n\n\r\nYou guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those. \r\n \nRead more",

Off I went to make a list, running down the published pieces and clicking whichever ones I thought were good. Then I looked at my list and said \"Oh, no!\", because it was extremely long. I cut it down by about half to get what we have here, a collection of interviews and thinky pieces and silly pieces and wonderful pieces from 2022.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a well-documented fact here at RPS that I love a good spreadsheet. Specifically, my spreadsheet that lists all the lovely games I manage to play each year. I've been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I'm pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. \nNo word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They're all absolutely rad).\nRead more",

I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.\nRead more",

Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.\nOut of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games.

          "description": "Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, \"Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!\". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like \"Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?\" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).\nBecause we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!\n Read more",

Players control a lone ship, piloting through the stars and taking on the invading forces of Galaga. Building upon Galaxian's award-winning action, Galaga offered an improved audio/video package, as well as cool new features such as the famous \"Tractor Beam\" enemy, and the ability for both the player and the enemy to morph into boosted variants of themselves.\nCheck out the classic interstellar action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29VVkfuXkVI&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays\nDesigned and developed by a small team within Namco, led by Shigeru Yokoyama, Galaga far surpassed the company's expectations, gaining the attention of the executives, which lead to increased efforts in marketing and shipping of the finished product. Galaga was a global smash on release, and would continue to be a mainstay of arcade centers well through the crash and into the late '80s. A gaming icon, Galaga has popped up in multiple movies — including WarGames, The Karate Kid, and The Avengers — and has even had an extinct species of prehistoric shark named after it!\nNot a bad legacy at all for some old-school pew-pew action.\nGalaga is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s iconic shmup Galaga jets into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

OPUS: Prism Peak is a new game from SIGONO, and it's taking a look through a camera lens for its story.\nSIGONO has developed several different narrative adventures under the OPUS banner, stretching back to 2016's OPUS: The Day We Found Earth. The Taiwanese studio found some breakout success with 2021's OPUS: Echo of Starsong, which received both audience critical acclaim, and found its way to the Switch with the Full Bloom Edition.\nWith OPUS: Prism Peak, the studio seems like its looking towards the camera for a new perspective. With the tagline \"Capture the moment, then learn to let go,\" it certainly seems poised for some powerful emotions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdMesmRJRNQ\nAccording to its Steam page, OPUS: Prism Peak is an adventure where choices will lead to diverging endings, as you play a photographer lost in an ethereal realm. You'll have to use your camera to uncover mysteries and find a way home through all of it.\nThe camera eye\nNot much more information has been shared just yet, but the premise alone is very intriguing. The camera has become a cool way of viewing video game worlds, whether on the arcade-like railways of Pokemon Snap or snapping shots of the final days in Umurangi Generation.\nWith a team like SIGONO behind it, OPUS: Prism Peak could be another one to watch in the realm of camera-based adventure. Hopefully we'll hear more about this project soon. Meanwhile, that leaves plenty of time to check out the other OPUS games.\nThe post OPUS: Prism Peak is the next narrative adventure from SIGONO appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even if it actually ends up being a little more low-key than usual, then I still want you to receive all of the simple pleasures and small joys that you deserve.\nIt must be said that we've all really been up against it in the early years of the new decade, with a lot of challenges that, frankly, nobody saw coming.

          "description": "We all scream for Scream Tail\nThe competitive battling scene in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet has been fascinating to watch. As new strategies have formed around the monsters introduced in Generation 9, top-tier battlers have had their work cut out for them trying to counter the emerging threats. Who could have guessed that Maushold had some of the highest damage potential in the game? Or how about Murkrow becoming one of the most used Pokemon?\nAs it turns out, the competitive scene faces another significant shakeup. Courtesy of Serebii, Paradox Pokemon will officially be removed from the ban list when Series 2 of Scarlet & Violet’s Ranked Battle modes begin on February 1st. This includes 14 endgame monsters that feature near-legendary base stats and powerful abilities. Even one Pokemon has the potential to change the metagame completely, so the addition of Paradox Pokemon will almost assuredly send ripples throughout the scene. Smogon, a hub for fan driven competitive Pokemon play, already ruled two of these Pokemon too powerful for its popular 6v6 singles format.\n[caption id=\"attachment_357146\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nSome still can't join\nParadox Pokemon will be the only new monsters in Series 2. Tera Raid exclusives like Charizard and Cinderace are still off the table for Ranked Battles. Furthermore, the Ruinous Quartet and Legendary Pokemon remain off-limits. Still, we’re bound to see entirely new strategies emerge with these monsters entering the fold. Pokemon that have seen no usage so far may become valuable strictly to counter these new threats.\nPokemon Scarlet & Violet have been critically contentious, but the interest in the official competitive scene is as strong as it has ever been. Even non-battlers can have fun watching how Paradox Pokemon fit into high-end play. Series 2 will run until March 31st, 2023.\nThe post Paradox Pokemon will be legal in Scarlet & Violet competitive play soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even with all the clout that still surrounds the game, it was still dethroned by another social deduction game that takes enough inspiration from Among Us that it's bordering on rip-off territory: Goose Goose Duck.\nThat's right, a game that basically just swaps out Among Us' signature bean-shaped crewmates with goofy-looking geese has surpassed the original's record for concurrent players — Among Us peaked at 447,476 players two years ago, while Goose Goose Duck had a peak (or should I say beak?)…",

But if you can't wait that long, there's also a demo arriving for One Piece Odyssey next week to tide you over until launch.\nProducer Katsuaki Tsuzuki announced in a new video today that a One Piece Odyssey demo will go live on January 10, just ahead of its January 13 launch date.\nThe demo will cover roughly the first couple hours of One Piece Odyssey, and save data from the demo will transfer over to the full game. It will follow Luffy and the crew washing up on the island where Odyssey takes place, coming face-to-face with new obstacles to overcome, and likely plenty of RPG battles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bBWs1dYFwk\nTsuzuki says the demo will highlight specific parts of what makes Odyssey a bit different, including its RPG bend towards tactical battles rather than action-heavy fights. The producer does note that since RPGs tend to have various elements unlock gradually over time, not all of the features can be discovered in the demo version.\nSpecifically, the memory worlds shown so far won't be in the demo. These are areas that let the Straw Hat Pirates revisit pieces of their past, going back to old memories of places to relive them. Those will be available after the demo version.\nSetting sail\nWhile it's a short span of time between demo and launch, this is at least a good chance to try out One Piece Odyssey to see if it's for you. While One Piece is no stranger to more action-oriented adaptations, Odyssey dives into the realm of RPGs. It's an interesting twist, and one that actually has me—an anime and RPG fan who doesn't normally vibe with One Piece—fairly interested.\nThe chance to try it out will arrive on January 10. Otherwise, One Piece Odyssey sets off on January 13 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post One Piece Odyssey is getting a demo just before its launch date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The thing is, while the former two titles are difficult trials in their own right, Contra: Hard Corps is one that I’ve never been able to fully consummate with. It’s hard.

          "description": "The Moira mains are delighted, though\nMoira used to be one of the most reliable picks among the lineup of Overwatch's healers. Her abilities aren't difficult to use which makes them viable for players of all skill ranges, plus she has great survivability and can deal good damage when it's needed. When Overwatch 2 dropped, however, Moira took on a new life with the five-player teams, and most will say these changes weren't for the best. A whole host of players decided they were tired of healing and wanted to use her as a glorified damage dealer. This is where the DPS Moira controversy began, and it's only snowballed from there.\nFast forward to now, and Blizzard released some new patch notes announcing a buff to the notorious Irish scientist. Now \"dealing damage with Biotic Orb now restores a small amount of Biotic Energy,\" or for laymen like me, when you deal damage with the purple ball it regenerates some of the yellow healing stuff you spray on your teammates. I guess the idea is that since players are going full DPS Moira anyway, they might as well make it easier to give your teammates more healing.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1611142281775484928\nI'm fairly skeptical that this change is going to be good in the long run, but that might be my knee-jerk reaction to hearing about another Moira buff. I want to say I trust that Blizzard knows what they're doing, but as of late my confidence in them has been waning. It'll be a waiting game to see how this buff affects play, and whether the devs will have to come back with a nerf in the near future.\nThese patch notes also detail the new Greek-themed arcade event Battle for Olympus, the new competitive season starting on January 10, and other balance changes for characters like Junker Queen, Zarya, and Brigitte.\n[Featured Image via Blizzard Entertainment]\nThe post Overwatch 2 patch notes announce Moira buff and players aren’t too happy appeared first on Destructoid.",

This new S-Tribute release, in keeping with other titles in the range, will include a selection of new quality-of-life features, including save states, a rewind function, slow-motion mode, various dip-switch settings, online leaderboards, and arcade-style scanline filters.\nCheck out a playthrough of the Sega Saturn edition below, via YouTuber NintendoComplete.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaKMxu3K2NY&ab_channel=NintendoComplete\nMetal Black is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shmup set within the timeline of a devasted Earth, recovering from the damage caused by a horrendous meteor attack. Following this catastrophic event, an alien force attempts to enslave the planet, leading to the surrender of humanity. One lone pilot, however, is not quite ready to kneel, and absconds with the hi-tech \"CF-345 Black Fly” vessel, in a one-man, do-or-die effort to turn the conquering alien force into space dust.\nAs previously noted, Metal Black is not one of the shmup genre's prettiest efforts, having launched during Taito's early '90s \"ugly-ass-visuals\" period. But it does contain a solid soundtrack, some cool boss characters, and two differing conclusions and is worth checking out for shmup completionists.\nMetal Black S-Tribute launches February 2 on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch\nThe post Taito shmup Metal Black gets the S-Tribute treatment in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

Many folks (myself included) agree that while there are technical issues that still need to be squashed, it does have a lot of good qualities, and is a great bar for the next iteration of an open world Sonic formula. For many, that's not going to be worth a sight unseen full MSRP price tag: but both of those deals have been altered a bit, in a good way!\nAs of this week, Sega surprise-dropped a Sonic Frontiers demo, which you can find either on the eShop on your actual Switch, or through the official listing here (just look for the \"download demo\" text below the main title). Perhaps not coincidentally, Sonic Frontiers is on sale now for $41.99 on the eShop (down from $59.99), so you can pick it up for a bit cheaper than at launch if you do dig it. Note that the sale does end on January 15 at 11:59PM PT, so you have some time to decide.\nAs we wait for a brand new iteration/Sonic Frontiers sequel, 2023 is looking bright for the game, as a huge roadmap was recently unveiled.

          "description": "This game seem 'sus to you?\nEpic Games has revealed the identity of the next title that it will be offering up to its users, free of charge, on its digital retail outlet Epic Games Store — Available to all as of January 12, the new freebie is Invisible Walls multiplayer mystery title First Class Trouble.\nLaunched on PC and PlayStation in November 2021, First Class Trouble sees a literal party of players shipped about a top-tier, highly elite space cruiser — the ISS Alithea. While the guests sip sweet champagne and carouse with the locals, the ship's A.I. unit, CAIN, goes rogue and decides to shut down the party and its patrons, permanently. Manifesting several lifelike androids known as \"Personoids\", CAIN attempts to sabotage the vessel's mainframe, while our inebriated toffs mount a rebellion n order to identify the Personoids, crush CAIN, and get back to drinking the night away.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_uu_fZJxLQ&ab_channel=PlayStation\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, First Class Trouble sees six players take the roles of guests and/or Personoids, with the former tasked with identifying and ejecting the latter, who themselves must disrupt the ship's mechanisms without being detected. If this all sounds suspiciously familiar — or should I simply say \"'sus\" — then that's by design, as First Class Trouble is essentially an alternate take on the party mystery genre popularized by InnerSloth's viral hit Among Us, albeit one sporting a bit more of a \"Gatsby\" vibe.\nFirst Class Trouble will be available to download from the Epic Games Store from January 12. Until then, you can still pick up current freebies Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics – Aiko’s Choice from the EGS dashboard. First Class Trouble is also available on PlayStation platforms via the PSN store.\nThe post First Class Trouble will be the next Epic Game Store freebie appeared first on Destructoid.",

While that number is not to be sniffed at, it represents a 6% drop on 2021. 20 million of these sales were digital, for a loss of 3.4% over 2021, while the remaining 14.2 physical sales represent a 9% drop year-on-year.

          "description": "A new standalone competitor arrives soon\nHTC has revealed its new standalone virtual reality headset, the Vive XR Elite. It's able to handle both virtual and augmented reality, and comes in at a price tag of $1,099.\nPre-orders went live today on sites like Amazon, where you can check out the specifications for this new headset. HTC's new set looks to compete with the likes of the Meta Quest, an extremely popular headset that's also cut out the cables.\nThis headset looks aimed to do many of the same things you'd expect out of something like the Meta Quest. It's a standalone VR headset that can also hook up to a PC for some extra power, and it has adjustable diopter dials for glasses-wearers. The battery allows for up to 2 hours of continuous power but is hot-swappable, and the screen comes in at a combined 3840 x 1920 resolution, with 110 degree field of view and 90 Hz refresh rate.\nQuite interestingly, the Vive XR Elite can also fold up into a case and go on-the-go with you, like a pair of sunglasses. It's a neat trick, but certainly intriguing for folks who want their VR games to travel with them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LPZr04Xf34\nAs for other Vive headsets, The Verge reports that the Vive Focus 3 and Vive Pro 2 headsets will stay on sale, though the Vive Flow will likely be retired near the end of the year.\nExpanding reality\nThis headset looks to compete in the growing market of VR/AR headsets, which is where other companies seem to be looking too. The Vive XR Elite looks to pack in some power with its headset, while still keeping things light and portable.\nIt's an interesting competitor to Meta's options, both for the price-bumped Quest 2 and the pricier Quest Pro. We'll have to see how this new headset fits into the landscape later on this year.\nThe post HTC unveils its new VR headset, the Vive XR Elite appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new release will include the arcade versions of both games and a selection of home console ports for both titles. Both the Japanese Puzzle Bobble and western Bust-a-Move variants will be available. Also included are over 1,000 fan-created stages from Puzzle Bobble 3 and an editor, allowing players to build their own colorful stage layouts.\nIn addition, The Puzzle Bobble S-Tribute release features a selection of modern options, including save states, a rewind function, slow-motion mode, various dip-switch settings, and arcade-style scanline filters. So if you fancy a trip down memory lane, then the confusingly titled Puzzle Bobble 2X / Bust-a-Move 2 Arcade Edition & Puzzle Bobble 3 / Bust-a-Move 3 S-Tribute (lordy) will be available digitally on February 2 on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.\nYou can check out a trailer below, courtesy of Nintendo Everything.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evmaoCCPtUk&ab_channel=NintendoEverything\nThe post Puzzle Bobble is the next franchise being visited by the S-Tribute range appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new Year Sale is live right now, with decent cuts into a chunk of the Nintendo Switch's catalog.\nThis year's sale runs from January 5 to January 15, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Purchases here goes towards Gold Points too, so it's easy to rack up some extra spending cash.\nSome highlights of this sale are actually some surprisingly recent games. For those looking to dump many, many hours into the Nintendo Switch at the start of the year, you don't need to look much further than Persona 5 Royal. The massive RPG finally made its way to Nintendo Switch last year, and the 30% cut drops the price tag down to $41.99.\nMario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is also on sale, albeit only for its Gold Edition. While the 22% cut takes it down to roughly $70, just a hair above the base game's price, it also include the Season Pass. And if you want a solid tactics game with some surprising and inventive takes on the genre, you can't really go wrong with Sparks of Hope.\nHeck, even Sonic Frontiers is seeing a 30% price cut, and AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative has also dropped by 30% for the sale too. This is a solid way to catch up on some games you might have missed at the end of last year.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4\nThe Switch sales carry on\nMy personal pick from the sale is Celeste, the incredible 2018 platformer which is dropped to a mere $5 for this sale. Seriously, if you haven't played Celeste, it is well worth your time.\nSome other price cuts have been popping up on the eShop too, as noted by social media sales aggregator Wario64. So if you're still looking to get a slightly obscure 3DS game like Culdcept Revolt for a low, low price, now's the time to do so.\nThe post The eShop New Year Sale has some Switch game discounts to kick off 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics - Aiko's Choice are free this week on the Epic Games Store.\nFrom now until January 12, you can hop onto the Epic store and claim both Kerbal Space Program and the standalone Shadow Tactics expansion Aiko's Choice for free. These will add the games to your library for good, so even if you're not looking to play either one right now, just claiming it puts them both in your collection for later.\nKerbal Space Program is the infamous rocket-disaster simulator about launching small, unsuspecting Kerbals into orbit with your specially designed rockets. It's a straightforward concept on paper that's made more complicated when you realize it is, actually, rocket science. Playing Kerbal is a pretty fun way to learn about how hard it is to put a metal tube in space, while also cackling when your plans go spectacularly awry.\nOtherwise, Aiko's Choice is a standalone expansion for Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. The base Shadow Tactics is a fairly well-liked stealth tactics game, and Aiko's Choice is like a concentrated version of it. It's a campaign all its own, and doesn't require the base Shadow Tactics to play.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAa9Ao26gtM\nGround control to Kerbal Tom\nIt's a solid pairing of games for this week's Epic giveaway. Both also sit in some interesting niches of gameplay, so this is really a good excuse to try them out without putting down any cash.\nAs for the next Epic Game Store freebie, the Store lists the impostor game First Class Trouble as its next upcoming game giveaway.

The glitch — which struck EA servers between Wednesday, December 28 and Thursday, December 29 — has corrupted the Franchise save files of many users, essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.\n\"Unfortunately, if you logged into franchise leagues during this time, your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in franchise files being corrupted,\" said EA in a statement. \"We know how important your franchises are to you, and we are actively working on a fix to restore some files via a backup as soon as possible.\"\nHowever, EA noted that, unfortunately, many of the affected save files were beyond repair, and that, of all corrupted data, only around 40% of users would find their Franchise data salvageable. Thus, it is simply a nerve-rattling case of \"fingers crossed\" for all those affected, as they wait to see whether their custom leagues — that they have no doubt poured many, many hours into curating — have been permanently wiped.\nMore information is expected from the EA tech team next week, and users are asked to keep a close watch on the official Madden 23 Twitter.

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.\nAhead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.\nDruckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…",

You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. \nPlayers control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nEpisode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle\nEpisode 2- When Doves Cry\nEpisode 3 - Bible.\nEpisode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair\nEpisode 5 - Map Daddy\nWatch on Twitch!\nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. \nThe first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …",

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nHow do you want to see the Metal Gear Solid series return?

The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. \n\n\nFormally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023.

Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.\nWith the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it.

When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind.

PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they'll be \"announced soon.\" You can read the full blog post here.\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.\nThis is also a friendly reminder to claim December's PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...",

It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon.

As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.\nWith Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing. Read more...",

          "description": "Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!\nPublished in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. \nA new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
