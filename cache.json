Wonder just last week, many folks have come to realise just how compatible the game is with different controllers. Given that you don't have to use the analogue stick for movement and can quite easily get by with the d-pad (in fact, many would turn their noses up at the very notion of controlling a 2D Mario game with an analogue stick), this opens up a lot of avenues through which to control the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Unfortunately, it’s not the pick of the bunch.\nGarden Buddies starts out well enough. Mutsy, a good-natured apple, invites you to their garden, a space you can decorate and customise. First up, you sprinkle flower seeds. The flowers become points you can exchange for items: various plants, stones, lanterns, a pond, a house. As you play you unlock new talking flora and fauna friends. They’re adorably designed: big shiny eyes, round bodies, little smiles.

Not only that but it's also now been 35 years since the debut launch of Super Mario Bros. 3 on the NES (as highlighted by our gorgeous pals over at Time Extension) in 1988. That's an awfully long time, and we've seen the Super Mario franchise blossom into an absolute titan in the years since, graduating to the 3D realm with Super Mario 64, spawning countless sports spin-offs and party games, and even gracing the big screen with the monumentally successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nAs for Super Mario Bros. 3, Nintendo's third (technically fourth) mainline outing was met with significant critical praise and is consistently regarded as one of the greatest games of all time to this very day. So much so, in fact, that it spawned not one, but two re-releases over the years, the first of which being part of Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES, and the second on the GBA as Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you look back on our review of 2023’s entry, we mentioned that it significantly improved the tried-and-tested formula, boosting the visuals nicely while allowing players to remove the constant reminders for the game’s subscription service, Just Dance+, which has 300 more songs. It made for an experience that, while certainly not revolutionary, was a welcome step in the right direction.\nJust Dance 2024 Edition, then, is more or less quite content to ride along on the coattails of its predecessor. It offers up another 40 new songs that cover a nice range of genres and styles which mixes the likes of ‘Survivor’ by Destiny’s Child with D Billions' 'My Name Is'; Whitney Houston's ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody’ with ‘Canned Heat’ by Jamiroquai (and no, sadly the choreography hasn’t been taken from Napoleon Dynamite for that one). More recent hits to make this year's roster include Miley Cyrus' 'Flowers' and Sam Smith's I'm Not Here To Make Friends.

I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.\nCome now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare.

          "description": "One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive's lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.\nThe game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Puzzle game Suika, or 'That Watermelon Game', is currently having a bit of a moment online. It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. \nThe goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I'd probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I'm honest.\nRead more",

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will \"absolutely\" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions.

I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight.

Take Subpar Pool's cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it's so heartbreaking I can't quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games' previous puzzle game, Holedown.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.\r\n\n\r\nI'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.\r\n \nRead more",

But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.\nThat's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you're into that, great! If you're not, then I'd slink back into that shadow.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game's mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that \"it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn't great.\" Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... \"feature-complete\" and \"into the polishing phase\", meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.\r\n\n\r\nCloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through \"OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson\" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2.

It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel.

The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  \nIt's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as \"initial piano concepts\" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month.

I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. \nIt's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).\nRead more",

Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response.

Where a sequel to Civilization's \"send a colony ship into space\" ending could have asked \"what if lasers and aliens\", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?\nRead more",

          "description": "Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.\nThis being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.\nRead more",

          "description": "Being as much of an insufferable, online-but-ultimately-in-quite-a-basic-way person as I am, I'm a Junji Ito girlie. The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status (\"This is my hole! It was made for me!\"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go \"Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito.\"\nThis isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as \"boring\", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a \"very serious adventure game\" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious \"holy elder\" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.\nThe game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a \"fairy tale\" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Amnesia games are set decades apart, but they all begin in the same moment, a moment of waking that is also a moment of erasure and disconnection, a rebirth outside the flow of events from which to descend into the machine of history afresh. On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his \"past self\", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the \"splendid architectures\" below.\nOn 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.\nBeware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.\nRead more",

It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. \nThere's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.\nRead more",

He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!\r\n\n\r\nSadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then.

          "description": "The Alt Controller showing at EGX this year was properly top tier stuff. There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. \nCase in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.\nRead more",

          "description": "I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. \nTaking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.\r\n\n\r\nMoral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.\n Read more",

The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate.

As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.\nThe headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Za poslední měsíc se událo spoustu nového. Se strahovskými bastlíři jste se mohli potkat na LinuxDays, kde jste si mohli zapájet demoboard s novým procesorem CH32V003 (RISC-V za deset centů, pro který mimochodem Vojta Suk napsal programátor běžící na Flipper Zero). Vyšlo Raspberry Pi 5 se spoustou inovací (i nových bugů), nový iPhone s Thread rádiem a USB-C místo Lightningu (který začali bastlíři hned hackovat) a v KiCADu už jde dělat databázové knihovny přes Inventree.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru si můžete něco poslechnout o nových osciloskopech od Rigolu (a jak probíhá jejich hackování), nové knize o Micro:bit deskách, koprocesoru RP1 na Rapsberry Pi 5, novém Turrisu nebo jak si postavit reléovou ústřednu s ethernetem a SCPI. Možná dojde i na ukázku redukce mezi USB a komunistickou kopií GPIB známou jako IMS-2.\r\n\r\nPokud jde o měkčí stránku bastlířství, tedy software, představí bastlíři nový Node-RED. Nedávno se objevil také levný čínský radar schopný rozeznat více objektů najednou a proběhlo další kolo TinyTapeout, ve kterém je možné nechat si vyrobit vlastní ASIC.\r\n\r\nŽe byl tento měsíc velmi plodný a náročný, lze poznat i z toho, že tentokráte mají strahováci neobvykle málo bizarních témat, mezi nimiž tentokrát kralují ESD kroksy a masivně paralelní instalace Rapsberry Pi v průmyslovém prostředí, která samozřejmě skončila neslavně.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 25. října od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Dynamight Studios announced today that its open-world sandbox MMORPG Fractured Online will be returning to Steam Early Access. The official release date for the return is November 8 at 10 a.m. ET. It's been a rough road so far for the MMO. Originally Gamigo became the publisher for the game, but after a short period of time Dynamight pulled the MMO from steam and later parted ways with Gamigo. They are now self-publishing the MMO as it heads back into early access.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems to be the common thing now for MMORPG developers to part ways with their publisher and take on the role. A couple of years ago Pearl Abyss split ways with Kakao Games over publishing popular MMORPG Black Desert Online. Not-yet-released MMO Ashes of Creation also split ways with its publisher, My.Games, and will self-publish the MMO whenever it releases.\n\n\nRegardless of the reason, it's good news for the players Gamigo has a history of killing MMOs, which they've done with Fiesta Online and most of Trion Worlds' lineup of MMOs including Archeage, Rift, and Trove.\n\n\nAs for Fractured Online, it looks like an entertaining twist on the sandbox MMO formula. Players will work together, and against one another, as they claim zones, gather resources, craft, trade, and build their own empire. The MMO features a player-driven economy as players can be farmers, hunters, scavengers, miners, crafters, and even merchants.\n\n\nApparently there were some wipes previously, but moving forward there will be no wipes unless it is \"strictly necessary\".\n\n\nFractured Online hits Early Access on Steam on November 8.\n\nThe post Fractured Online returns to Steam Early Access next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players can participate in obstacle courses inspired by the free-to-play title within the Golden Saucer casino/theme park.\n\n\nInitially announced in July, the crossover teased FFXIV characters crossing a bright obstacle course. Fall Guys, meanwhile was receiving skins from the critically acclaimed MMORPG. Outside the stills shown within the teaser, the details are light on the FFXIV side. That is still the case since the blog post announcing the patch tells fans to stay tuned for more details.\n\n\nAs of now, the crossover's webpage is also giving the same instructions, so hopefully, more details arrive soon. Based on the images shown, players will race others while avoiding various dangers and collaborate with others to collect gems. The Fall Guys influence is evident here, but the events have details from Final Fantasy titles.\n\n\nThe event tonally fits with what the Golden Saucer goes for, which is grand and extravagant fun for any attendees. In my experience playing Final Fantasy XIV, chucking players into an arena with dozens of others is something the casino would do. Plus Fall Guys is the perfect game to collaborate with on this event given that it's that title's premise.\n\n\nIt's unknown how long this event will go on, especially since the FFXIV skins in Fall Guys are no longer available. Hopefully, the courses live up to their potential enough for fans to sink more hours earning prizes in the casino.\n\nThe post Fall Guys meets FFXIV next week in Gold Saucer Patch 6.5 update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dynasty Warriors 9 is getting another turn in the spotlight, this time in the form of a mobile game. Nexon and Koei Tecmo announced Dynasty Warriors M for a global release this winter. \n\n\nDynasty Warriors M promises an action-RPG based on the ninth mainline entry, which left something to be desired when it launched in 2018. The mobile version for iOS and Android will be free-to-play with in-app purchases, offering over 50 Officers from five factions to \"collect and develop.\" Each Officer has their own tactics to employ across 520 stages and 13 regions.\n\n\nAccording to Gematsu, a soft launch is live in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines. While we wait for the worldwide launch, Nexon Korea shared some cinematic trailers. This one highlights the Battle of Hulao Gate:\n\n\n\n\nThe last we heard of Dynasty Warriors 9 was the Empires expansion that launched in 2021. M isn't the first game to strike phones and tablets exclusively. Dynasty Warriors: Overlords recently mixed Musou combat with town building, quests, and very mobile-style events. As teased in some of the videos, M will cover territory familiar to anyone modestly well-versed in the Three Kingdoms era. Settings like the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Siege of Luoyang are deeply tread hack-and-slashing ground.\n\n\nWill Dynasty Warriors M revitalize the greatest video game series ever? The official English Facebook page is live for anyone who wants to keep up with the game in the months leading up to its global release. \n\nThe post Dynasty Warriors M launches on mobile around the world this Winter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Alan Wake 2's launch rapidly approaching, fans are more than ready to jump back into Bright Falls. Before you get too excited, you should check your PC specs to ensure your graphics card supports mesh shading. \n\n\nOn Twitter, a Remedy developer stated that the Nvidia GeForce 10 series and AMD Ryzen 5000 graphics cards aren't mentioned in the PC spec requirements because \"only cards with mesh shaders are officially supported\" and they're \"not sure it will run without it.\" Hence, just because an RX 5700 XT can perform in the same ballpark as some of the supported cards, this doesn't guarantee you'll be able to play the game. \n\n\nThe tweets have since been deleted, though screenshots are still available on Reddit. Remedy was going to implement vertex shaders, which the cards support, but they dropped after it caused performance issues and bugs. The developer states that vertex shaders could, in theory, be added later via a mod, but it's not something you should hold your breath for. \n\n\n\n\nThis news comes as fans are still reeling from the high PC spec requirements for the game. A new Nvidia trailer showcasing ray tracing in Alan Wake 2 makes it apparent why Remedy has made the choices it had. With ray tracing on, Bright Falls becomes a visual treat filled with reflective puddles, accurate shadows, and shiny surfaces that reflect light.  \n\n\nIt has been a 13-year-long wait but Alan Wake 2 will finally launch on October 27. \n\nThe post Graphics cards that don’t support mesh shading may not be able to play Alan Wake 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's Valentine's Day for you romantics out there.\n\n\nThe release date was actually announced last week as part of The Indie Horror Showcase, and I have absolutely no idea how I missed it. Sucker for Love: First Date, if you recall, held a prestigious position as one of \"Zoey Handley’s Top 10 Picks of 2022.\" It's a dating sim in which you perform arcane rituals to win the heart(s?) of an existential threat to humanity. I love it for its unique take on the genre, as well as its spot-on sense of humor.\n\n\n\n\nSucker for Love: Date to Die For has had a demo for yonks, but I've yet to try it. Rather than cast you as a lust-driven cultist trapped in their apartment, this one has you kidnapped and in need of escape. Damn, these ladies really know what I'm into. I wonder if Hastur will be in this one. The way she says \"Yhtil\" puts the wobble in my knees.\n\n\nSucker for Love: Date to Die For incorporates the 360-degree camera of Phasmophobia and includes more exploration. At the forefront of all the press is the dateable Rhok'zan, The Black Goat of the Woods. I'm down. I love a girl with horns.\n\n\nI now have plans for Valentine's Day because Sucker for Love: Date to Die For is coming out on February 14, 2024 for PC.\n\nThe post Sucker for Love: Date to Die For brings eldritch seduction on February 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Spider-Man games, in general, have often strived to provide the best facsimile of the protagonist’s preferred mode of transportation, web swinging, so adding something like gliding to the mix is a bit of an affront to me. It’s a personal preference, but thankfully, I can mostly ignore the skill and just get around the old-fashioned way. I often forget it even exists.\n\n\nHowever, while I was looking through Spider-Man 2’s various options to see if there is a way to turn off the visual wind-tunnel effects (there doesn’t seem to be), I did find something that might only appeal to strict swingers like myself.

This news came courtesy of Wizards of the Coast via press release and a new, rather down-to-earth YouTube teaser video. \n\n\nMultiple Planes Makes For Easy Collabs\n\n\nFocusing on the press release, fans won't have to wait too long for the first Marvel Universes Beyond collab deck. In 2025, WotC will release the first tentpole Magic set (a full card collection complete with boosters, starter decks, etc.) and continue to create new boosters and sets well into the future. No definitive end date was provided for this collaboration at this time.\n\n\nPresident of WotC, Cynthia Williams, has the following to say regarding this collaboration, \"We are extremely proud to collaborate with Marvel to bring its iconic characters to fans around the world in new ways. These tentpole sets will build on the tradition of incorporating beloved fan-favourite characters and elements from world-class brands into Magic: The Gathering.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe YouTube video, on the other hand, only provides a small tease rather than anything of substance. If any of the other Universes Beyond Magic the Gathering decks are anything to go by though, fans have little to worry about.\n\n\nUniverses Beyond is Wizard's of the Coast's ongoing crossover event with MTG. Each set takes major characters, places, and terms from the show and builds a full set around it with varying success. For anyone out of the know, recent properties to cross over are Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings with Fallout, Final Fantasy, and Assassin's Creed coming in the near future. So yes, players will be able to play two-headed giant matches of Clive and Altair versus one of the Doctors and Iron Man within a few years.

That's if rumors from a number of sources are to be believed.\n\n\nSpeculations were shared by Videocardz (which originally came from Benchlife as well as a source on Twitter/X). It appears as though some information has fallen into the hands of leakers who assert that the boosted RTX 4080 is in the works.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia hasn't confirmed any of this at the time of writing. Suffice it to say, many grains of salt should be consumed while chewing this latest information.\n\n\nEither a SUPER or a Ti\n\n\nIt's also looking like this elusive new model could sport the full AD102 chip, the same one used in the RTX 4090. The current 4080 uses AD103, so – as Videocardz says – the potential SUPER variant would need the AD102 GPU if it hopes to squeeze in 20GB of memory.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that sources have not specifically said that it will be part of the SUPER series, so it could even be a Ti. In any case, temper expectations for now until Nvidia makes a formal statement about these rumors.\n\n\nSpeculations about the potential Nvidia graphics card were doing the rounds recently. We also know that Team Green had to \"unlaunch\" a 12GB version of the RTX 4080 about a year ago.\n\n\nThe 4000 series – named \"Ada Lovelace\" after the 19th century English mathematician – kicked off in October 2022. We've had a number of product launches since then, including a couple of Ti models.

Now, Battlestate Games has announced that its more focused and hectic Escape From Tarkov: Arena title will be coming out sometime in December 2023, and the players are highly suspicious of this claim.\n\n\nThe news broke when Forbes covered a recent interview with the Battlestate Games CEO, Nikita Buyanov, stating that \"Early December is a good period of time that we want to release [Arena].\" This soon made its way onto the r/pcgaming subreddit, where Tarkov players flocked to share their takes on what's actually bound to happen with Arena.\n\n\nWhat to make of Escape From Tarkov: Arena?\n\n\n\"For anyone uninitiated,\" said Reddit user bauN7, \"Battle State Games has been late on every single timeline they've ever given for Tarkov. Literally every. Single. One.\" Aside from the matters of release date windows, the players are also cynical about the value that Arena may or may not be adding to Tarkov as a whole. \n\n\nThe situation is similarly dire on the official Tarkov subreddit, where players are admittedly being more technical in their critique at least. TheJigglyfat highlighted a situation in which Tarkov's emblematic desync issues caused massive differences between what two different players were seeing, which means that the match was effectively decided by lag live on stream.\n\n\nIt's not a great look, then, but the community's jadedness isn't necessarily a sign that BSG will have trouble managing Arena as well. In the end, if push comes to shove, at least the single-player offline version of Tarkov seems to be prospering well enough.\n\nThe post Escape From Tarkov: Arena gets a release date, but the community is skeptical appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it comes to the topic of the best horror games of the last PlayStation era, Alien: Isolation typically ranks high. And why wouldn't it? With its terrifying atmosphere, deadly antagonist, and choo-choo train, its horror is as memorable as it is intense.\n\n\nWait. What was that last thing?\n\n\nAh, that's right. Trains. You see, it turns out someone decided to swap out the Xenomorph in Alien: Isolation for the less sinister-looking Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\n\nImage via MattFiler\n\n\n\nThe mod comes courtesy of ModDB user MattFiler, with the rationale that this was something that just \"had to happen sooner or later.\" A short video on the download page shows the new model in action. It doesn't quite have the finesse of the titular alien creature, but it still retains an element of dread and danger.\n\n\nThomas the Tank Engine horror is still horror\n\n\nIt might look a little goofy, but it reminds me (as I'm sure it will many of you) of the famous Skyrim mod that did something similar to Alduin. Then there's Choo-Choo Charles, the 2022 horror game about a killer train.\n\n\nThere's something about taking a loveable fictional character from many childhood memories and putting them in a different context. In this case, horror. While not many Alien: Isolation players are happy about being downed by the frighteningly fast creature, it's also not preferable to be the target of Thomas.\n\n\nOf course, the spooky season is almost upon us, so we can probably expect to see some other mash-up of innocence and terror. Maybe the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can make us piss ourselves in Outlast.\n\nThe post Thomas the Tank Engine comes to Alien: Isolation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following Spider-Man 2's successful launch last week, PlayStation has revealed just how impactful the game was. In the first 24 hours alone, the game sold over 2.5 million copies. This makes it the fastest-selling title from PlayStation's first-party studios. \n\n\n\n\nNumbers from the UK are also impressive. GameIndustry.biz reveals that Spider-Man 2 clenched the top spot when it comes to physical sales in the UK, surpassing Super Mario Bros Wonder. It also had 5% greater sales than Hogwarts Legacy on PS5. Overall, it is the 4th biggest physical launch in the UK this year, surpassed by Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, EA Sports FC24, and Hogwarts Legacy on all platforms.\n\n\nSpider-Man 2's success is a product of some wise choices made by Sony over the years. It purchased the Spider-Man IP from Marvel in 1999 for $7 million which has turned out to be an incredibly advantageous move. Years later, Sony then tapped Insomniac to develop a new Spider-Man game, leading to the PS4 game. Not long after the studio was purchased by Sony for $229 million. \n\n\nInsomniac has proven itself yet again, but the studio isn't ready to sleep yet. Superhero fans can also look forward to Wolverine which is currently in development. \n\nThe post Spider-Man 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever appeared first on Destructoid.",

The recent installment in Blizzard's celebrated action-RPG series is literally collecting blood, with some potential hardware to come from it.\n\n\nA recent video on the Diablo YouTube channel invites players to donate blood (presumably their own) to their local clinic. In doing so, rewards will be on offer. From donating blood.\n\n\n\n\nTo take that a step further, the studio is also looking to put together a custom PC that's liquid cooled by 666 quarters of real human blood. Anyone interested in taking part will need to show proof of their donation before the end of November 20.\n\n\nDevelopers literally asking for a blood sacrifice\n\n\nA website set up by the Diablo 4 team gives further details about the publicity stunt. According to the FAQ, you don't technically have to donate in order to get the rewards. This is simply about enough people donating to reach a required amount.\n\n\nA post on Twitter/X says that the in-game rewards \"will be unlocked for all players as we progress toward our donation goal.\" The custom-built PC is the endgame of all this. \n\n\nAs for the specs, it sounds like it's going to be a pretty beefy system. It'll boast an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card, an Intel Core i9-13900K CPU, 64GB of RAM, and 3TB of M.2 SSD storage. Also, did I mention the human blood that's going to course through it?

Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.\n\n\nDark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. \nStar Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

This new show will feature more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage, and goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25. \nYou can watch the Xbox Partner Preview on Xbox-owned channels for a look at games coming to both Xbox and Windows PCs alongside new information about some upcoming Game Pass titles from the company's third-party partners.

          "description": "Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.\nIn a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.\nThis feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless. \n\n\nWe’ve enjoyed our time with Peter and Miles, and you can read our thoughts by checking out our Spider-Man 2 review here.

The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.\nThe collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.\nWe had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Read our review if you want to know about all of that.  \nNotably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform).

As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.\nAs for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. \nCheck out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. \nBuying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. \nFor more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.\nAre you jumping into Ghostrunner 2 next week?

Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. \nSpeaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.\nCheck out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paradox Rift arrives on store shelves on November 3.

          "description": "One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.\nOne Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

We loved it – read Game Informer's review of it here – and are excited for everyone to get their hands on it. Yesterday, we learned Insomniac Games recommends players download the day one patch for the \"best experience\" before starting the first mission, and now, we've learned when to expect the fan-favorite New Game Plus feature in the sequel. \nAs first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, \"No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1.\"\nNo - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1\nOctober 17, 2023\nAfter someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. \nSomeone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it \"should be before end of year.\"\nShould be before end of year\nOctober 18, 2023\nSo if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch.

It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.\nFor a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game \"inspiring\".\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. \nMore specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2. \nKeep up with the latest updates for Marvel's #SpiderMan2PS5! #BeGreaterTogether pic.twitter.com/Z8ZDjscyB4\nOctober 17, 2023\n\"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement,\" Insomniac's statement reads. \"But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version.\" \nAs for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. \nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then watch this Marvel's Spider-Man 2 cinematic trailer.

Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. \nAnalogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:\nAn image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: \nAnalogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have \"4 original-style controller ports,\" presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed \"us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,\" and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. \nAnalogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024.

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster.

This means that Activision Blizzard, which is the company behind franchises like Call of Duty and Diablo, is now part of Xbox's first-party umbrella. As a result, Xbox's stable of IPs and game franchises has become much larger, welcoming the likes of Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more. \nWhile many know Activision Blizzard as the company behind industry juggernauts like Call of Duty and Overwatch, the company is home to plenty more games.

The organization sees shadow libraries, including LibGen and Sci-Hub, as key problems, with the relatively new meta-search engine Anna's Archive also getting a mention. Third-party intermediaries pose problems too, the publishers note, with abuse of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as a growing concern. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!\nDark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
