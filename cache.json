He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

          "description": "Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.\nThe newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as \"Ghost Of A Tail\" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.\nAnyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year.

One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

          "description": "If Space Marine 2's wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.\n Read more",

          "description": "If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve's new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.\nRead more",

Naturally, there's plenty of reasons to be excited, but EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about the promo cards as of writing. Only the release date has been confirmed, and if you're looking to find out more about the cards, you'll need to rely on the social media leaks and rumors. \n\n\nComplete list of EA FC 25 NumeroFUT promo players\n\n\nUnlike Winter Wildcards, NumeroFUT won't be having any special set of Heroes and Icons. It will only include promo cards for active footballers, and a few big names have already been leaked. \n\n\n\nRafael Leao\n\n\nRobert Lewandowski\n\n\nJames Maddison\n\n\nEduardo Camavinga\n\n\nJonathan Tah\n\n\nJames Rodriguez\n\n\nPedro Neto\n\n\nDusan Vlahovic\n\n\nLeon Goretzka\n\n\n\nMore names are expected to be added as the release date gets closer. Once we have more leaks, the names will be added to this list. James Rodriguez could be an interesting addition since he's been reintroduced to Ultimate Team only recently. Just like Juan Mata and David De Gea, we could get this first special card during the upcoming campaign.\n\n\nNumeroFUT will go live on Friday, January 3, at 6 p.m. UK time when the special cards will be added to the packs. A few items are also expected to be released via SBCs and objectives, so make sure to be on the lookout for those. Additionally, Season 4 rewards also feature a few NumeroFUT items with Marco Asensio available as early as level 11. That's a great way to stack your club with a few promo items for free. \n\nThe post All EA FC 25 NumeroFUT promo player leaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Egg of the King is a vital resource to find, and doing so will allow you to upgrade Griffin in Anime Adventures.\n\n\nThis particular item is tied closely to the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can earn via different in-game activities. To evolve Griffin, you'll need Periapt of the King to access him first. Let's take a look at how to get this item in the first place.\n\n\nHow to get Egg of the King in Anime Adventures\n\n\nSo far, the only known way to find Egg of the King is by using a Summoning Circle. The odds will be low as it's a Mythic item. Odds-wise, you can obtain it from any available banners, but the Special one will have better chances with a 2x Mythic boost. Do note that it's a matter of luck, and you may require a lot of diamonds to make the rolls.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no sure-shot way to obtain this item, which would certainly have been nice. Nevertheless, the item isn't tied to a time-limited event, so you can have your fair share of tries even if initially unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the Periapt of the King in Anime Adventures\n\n\nAs I said earlier, the Periapt of the King is closely associated with the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can find in Anime Adventures. The Egg of the King will be available in your items stash, and you can also search for it using its name. Once you select the item and decide to use it, a red portal will open, leading you to the Griffin NPC location. From there, you can use the Eggs of Sacrifice to evolve him.\n\n\nIf you're unsure how to get Eggs of Sacrifice, check this guide out. As with Egg of the King, the Eggs of Sacrifice will also require concentrated efforts and a long time to find. You can also sacrifice Mythic items to quicken the process, but you'll lose those units permanently.\n\nThe post Anime Adventures Periapt of the King guide: How to get Egg of the King appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Completing the Periapt of Sacrifice should be a top priority if you want mighty units in Anime Adventures. Doing so will help you get the Eggs of Sacrifice, which will be necessary as you upgrade your units.\n\n\nLet's take a look at how you can farm the Periapt of Sacrifice and gain the eggs in a consistent fashion.\n\n\nBest way to farm Sacrifice Eggs in Anime Adventures\n\n\nThe most consistent way to get the Eggs of Sacrifice is by using Eclipse Portals. These portals can be acquired from the Snow Kingdom Infinite mode. While the mode can be difficult for beginners, completing it won't be an issue if you have units over level 100.\n\n\nTo make the most out of your urns, try to host the Eclipse Portals, as it will increase your final rewards. However, you can also join runs set up by other players, although the rewards will get lower. If the Eclipse Portal runs feel difficult, you can play with your friends or other players, making it easier to survive all the waves.\n\n\nAdditionally, speak with Zen to get a daily quest for seven Periapts of Sacrifice. To complete the mission, kill the demons that spawn in Eclipse Portals and Snow Kingdom Infinite mode.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Eggs of Sacrifice in Anime Adventures\n\n\nOnce you complete a run, you'll get a random amount of Periapts of Sacrifice. The number of eggs you get for hosting a run will always be higher. You'll have to teleport to the special area of Griffin NPC to use the eggs. To do so, you'll need the Periapt of the King.\n\n\nTo evolve, you'll need around 200 eggs as each one progresses your Ascension by 0.5%. You can also sacrifice Mythical units that you don't need to quicken the process. Sacrificing evolved Mythical units will provide the best progression, but you'll lose the units permanently.\n\nThe post Anime Adventures Periapt of Sacrifice guide: How to get Eggs of Sacrifice appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, this system is slightly different in terms of how it works. Let's take a look at how you can promote your character, along with the resources you will need.\n\n\nHow to rank up in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nThe process begins by completing as many quests or missions as you can. Completing them will earn you various rewards and EXP. The amount of EXP you get varies based on the nature and difficulty of quests, but completing them will help you grow your in-game character.\n\n\nWhen you begin this process, you'll have the rank of \"Non-Sorcerer.\" Once you reach level 60, you can talk with the Clan Head NPC to rank yourself up. There are five different ranks (or, as the game calls it, Grades), and you'll need certain resources besides being at the necessary player levels. Once you fulfill the requirements and have the necessary resources, interacting with the Clan Head NPC will allow you to rank up.\n\n\nAll promotion levels in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nThe following table details all the prerequisites applicable for the five rank-up levels.\n\n\nGrade\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nGrade 4\nReach Level 60\nCollect 25 Mission Essence\n$5,000\n\n\nGrade 3\nReach Level 120\nCollect 50 Mission Essence\n$50,000\n\n\nGrade 2\nReach Level 180\nCollect 100 Mission Essence\n$100,000\n\n\nGrade 1\nReach Level 240\nCollect 150 Mission Essence\n$250,000\n\n\nSpecial Grade\nReach Level 300\nCollect 200 Mission Essence\n$500,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from in-game credits and EXP, you'll also need to get a lot of Mission Essence. The requirements go up as you reach higher ranks, and here is our guide on the best ways to farm Mission Essence.

Instead, it got added to the accounts of those who have been Blox Fruits for some time now and had downloaded Update 24 before the developers pulled back. As I said, this item has certain uses inside the game, so let's understand how it works.\n\n\nHow to get Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits\n\n\nUpdate 24 introduced several new things to Blox Fruits, which included an updated version of the Dragon Fruit. Unfortunately, the update was pulled back by the developers, and players who had the Dragon Fruit lost access to it. To compensate the players, they were handed something called a Dragon Token.\n\n\nAgain, this token is of two types. Players having a non-permanent or physical version of the Dragon Fruit were provided with a regular Dragon Token. Those who had a permanent Dragon Fruit were provided with a Permanent Dragon Token.\n\n\nIncidentally, the price of Dragon Fruit has been raised from 4,000 Robux to 5,000 following the implementation of Update 24.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits\n\n\nThe use of a Dragon Token mostly depends on the type you have. If you have a permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to obtain a permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. The version will be completely randomized, but it's a great return since you're getting an upgraded version of the Dragon Fruit.\n\n\nIf you received a non-permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to get a non-permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. Again, the final item you get will be completely randomized. If you end up getting a duplicate Dragon Fruit in your inventory, it will be automatically changed to a Mythical Fruit.\n\nThe post How do Dragon Tokens work in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can buy the set's individual pieces or all three items at once starting from December 30 until the event's end date, January 2, 2025.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can view the Sparkling Resolution outfit by selecting the shoe and lipstick button on the left side of your screen and navigating to the dress button.\n\n\nYou have the option to buy each of the three items separately or all at once if you have enough cash. Below is the cost of every Sparkling Resolution piece:\n\n\n\nSparkling Dress: $4,500\n\n\nSparkling Sleeve: $1,000\n\n\nSparkling Necklace: $500\n\n\n\nPurchasing all three pieces costs $6,000 in-game money, making it not only possible to acquire without spending real money but making it cheaper than sets like Myra the Magical Girl. However, it's only available until January 2, giving you just a few days to get your hands on this exclusive outfit. \n\n\nIt doesn't come with a hairstyle or makeup, though, so you may have to use a few Dress to Impress codes to complete the set.\n\n\nLike other outfits in Dress to Impress, you can customize the Sparkling Resolution set to match your current theme. Depending on the theme, you may have to change it to other common colors like white, black, red, or a mix of several hues.

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten \"remaster\".\nU zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album \"Discovery\". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",
