They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!\nOr it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.\nWelcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.\nRead more",

It's possible to install Windows on your Steam Deck if you wish, but the drivers are rudimentary and there are a bunch of obstacles when it comes to controlling Windows via Steam Deck's controls or its touchscreen.\r\n\nA leaked project from an internal Microsoft hackathon shows that staff at the operating system developer have noticed these issues - although it sounds like a version of Windows optimised for gaming handhelds is a long way off.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics.

It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.\r\n\nFifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as \"The Sandvich Saga\" on a regular basis.\nRead more",

It’s clearly riffing on Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland as our protagonist, the titular Ravenlok, moves to a new inherited house, gets sucked through a magical mirror and steps into a trippy, mushroom-filled land. From there, she needs to fight this realm's off-brand Queen Of Hearts and save the remaining, slightly weird, storybook denizens.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.\nIt's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.\nRead more",

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.\n“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.\nRead more",

The new look debuted at this weekend’s Star Wars Celebration - both well-timed fate and a clever bit of corporate brand synergy. The 2-minute trailer is packed with action shots while returning favourite Cere gives a very sombre speech about the dark times the galaxy is facing. Although, when is the Star Wars universe not in dark times? When are the odds ever in your favour? And what happened to \"never tell me the odds?\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.\nToday both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. \r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.\r\n\n\r\nAfter spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. \r\n\n\r\nBut for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's weird that Road 96 has gotten a prequel, because it only came out about six months ag- what's that? A year and a half? Good lord. Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.\nIn Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.\nRead more",

And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?\nA sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless.

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.\nI recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.\nRead more",

With a busy four days in Boston for PAX East, mine and Liam's brains were basically mush last week, so Rebecca - an absolute angel - graciously said she could host a special PAX East episode where she chats with Liam and me about the indies we saw on the show floor and try desperately to string together a coherent sentence. She also made bulletpoints of our entire chat so writing up the shownotes would be easier; we do not deserve her.\nSaying that, our exhaustion doesn't stop us from kicking up a riot over the BAFTA Game Awards at the start of the episode. We then delve into our PAX East indie round up and, as always, we end with our current hyperfixations.\nYou can listen and subscribe via your podcast provider of choice!

          "description": "A belated apology to anyone who was assaulted by a sudden burst of upbeat bagpipes in the GDC press room the other week. I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going \"full pipe\" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. \nBut also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.\nRead more",

Jediná přípustná praktika byla, že se mikrokód CPU nahraje standardně ještě před startem operačního systému, jak se sluší a patří. Nyní AMD ale hlásí, že práce jsou hotovy a na současných procesorech AMD lze považovat pozdní nahrávání mikrokódu CPU u již běžících linuxových systémů za důvěryhodné a bezpečné.

The full co-op gameplay showcase didn't get everyone on-board with the direction though, and growing concern over a live service-focused structure took root.\nSo, now, Rocksteady's co-op Suicide Squad game is pushing the launch time back further. With an actual date set, that's at least something. But even the concept of February 2024 seems so distant right now, I've got to wonder what sentiment will be like when Warner Bros. and Rocksteady resurface later on.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is now launching on February 2, 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League officially delayed to February 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sing with me, sing for the year\nMusical role-playing adventure Stray Gods is charting a course for launch. The vocal venture will kick off on August 3 for PC.\nThe debut game from Summerfall Studios, Stray Gods is a story about Grace, who gets caught up in the life and drama of Greek gods after she's made the prime suspect in the death of Calliope. In the process, she comes into some new powers, and will have the opportunity to discover the truth. Maybe she can even find some romance on the side?\nThis quest for truth, answers, and heavenly connections plays out in interactive musical form. Characters break out into song, and the player gets to make choices about the tone of Grace's responses, potentially shifting the overall tenor and direction of the song.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coQQ-K8Iwi8\nThe voice of the gods\nIt's a pretty fascinating system, with former Dragon Age writer David Gaider penning the script. And alongside an interesting premise and narrative framing, there's also a host of voice talent signed on. Here's a rundown of the voice actors working on Stray Gods:\nLaura Bailey as Grace\nTroy Baker as Apollo\nMary Elizabeth McGlynn as Persephone\nJanina Gavankar as Freddie\nKhary Payton as Pan\nAbubakar Salim as Eros\nFelicia Day as Athena\nRahul Kohli as Minotaur\nAllegra Clark as Hecate\nMerle Dandridge as Aphrodite\nErika Ishii as Hermes\nAshley Johnson as Calliope\nLauren \"Lolo\" Spencer as Venus\nAnjali Bhimani as Medusa\nKimberly Brooks as Oracle\nAnthony Rapp as Orpheus\nThrow in Austin Wintory as composer, alongside musicians Scott Edgar, Steven Gates, Simon Hall of Tripod, and Jess Cerro (Montaigne), and it's a lot of talent.\nHonestly, I am very curious to see how an interactive musical like this would shake out. These branching paths intrigue me, as does the Greek pantheon theming around a murder mystery. We'll see how Summerfall's debut Stray Gods comes together on August 3.\nThe post Stray Gods, a roleplaying musical with a lot of voice talent, arrives in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

That changes today, as Hooded Horse has announced the latest update to Eremite Games’ Early Access settlement game.\nThe Sentinels of the Forest update expands Against the Storm with a new playable race of fox people (the fifth species in the game), as well as their faction-specific technologies. Apparently, the Foxes work with “rainwater-fueled technologies,” but most importantly, they make tea. There are both tea houses that can be built, as well as tea doctors, which heal people using the powers of tea.\nCheck out the new trailer below, courtesy of GameTrailers.\nhttps://youtu.be/vPdCARWzUYE\nI also use tea to cure all my ills. Specifically, if I feel tired in the morning (which is every morning), I usually drink two pots of tea and follow it up with a nap. That usually gets me the energy I need to make it to lunch.\nAgainst the Storm is a city builder that has you build to survive torrents of corrupting rain. Rather than focus on a single settlement, you work to connect a network of them with previous towns assisting newly built ones. It bills itself as a roguelite, where certain portions of your progress are carried over to new games, and “hundreds” of gameplay modifiers ensure that no two playthroughs are the same.\nDamn. I’m going to have to check this out.\nAgainst the Storm is currently in Early Access on PC. There's a demo available if you're curious. If everything is on track, the full release should come in a few months.

And now, we’ve got a date for it: May 23, 2023.\nI know so very little about Warhammer 40,000. This 30-second trailer tells me absolutely nothing about the property, while at the same time telling me everything I need to know about the game. There’s jumping. There are people blowing up.

However, you don’t really need much context for it. There are vampires, beastmen, and BDSM elves, and that’s all you need to know. Or, at least, that’s all I need to know.\nSimilarly, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun has it all: rocket launchers, shotguns, and bloody messes. You play as a space person, and I may be an outlier here, but I really hope that they don’t make constant wisecracks.

          "description": "Companions, villagers, and the return of a king\nNintendo aired the final pre-launch trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom today, and it was quite a doozy. From more story context and mechanical teases to the confirmation of a longtime series villain, there's a lot to unpack.\nWhile the general story set-up still feels a little unclear, we do know one thing for sure: Ganondorf is back. The king of the Gerudo appears a few times in today's trailer, and also seems to be speaking over the trailer at a few points. Zelda also looks to be lost, in some way; we catch a glimpse of Link failing to catch and save her, and then again, her calling for Link to come find her.\nEven further, we see Hyrule alive in a pretty spectacular way. Not only are there towns popping up in the ruins of the land, but we see villagers fighting enemies, and companions teaming up with Link. Heck yes, Sidon and Link can fight together!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ\nThe kingdom closes in\nThis is the third official trailer, and also the last one before The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches next month. Compared to previous games, even its predecessor Breath of the Wild, it's felt like we haven't seen a ton about this entry. Then again, that's mostly been working, in my opinion.\nThe recent gameplay showcase did spotlight Link's new abilities, seemingly linked to his arm. Today's showcase went even further in though, showing all the wild ways in which they can be used. Cars and flying machines are one thing, but in the trailer today we see Link carting around villagers with a horse-drawn carriage and fighting a walking bokoblin fortress.\nAdd in a bunch of wild machinery and possible Zonai influence, and I feel like I've got even more questions now. All in all, a pretty solid video to pick apart in the last month leading up to Tears of the Kingdom's launch on May 12.\nThe post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s final trailer is absolutely packed appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll also get 10,000 LP (League Points) for your efforts.\nThe code will actually be doled out through Pokemon Home, which you can then input in Scarlet & Violet via the Mystery Gift system. Yeah, that's not complicated at all! Maybe one day you can just get the reward directly in-game when participating in an online event instead of jumping through hoops.\nThe post Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is getting a free promo Great Ball backpack appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Y can't Sims crawl?\nThanks to a reader, this lengthy thread of Sims 4 fun facts from Twitter user OnlyAbiDoang came across my desk and I couldn't look away. Even if you haven't played The Sims series yet you likely know someone who has: or at least experienced it by osmosis through some sort of weird factoid throughout the years. It's that ubiquitous. But I didn't realize just how wacky I could get.\nhttps://twitter.com/onlyabidoang/status/1640039940640890880\nHere are a few choice facts from the thread:\nIf you get struck by lightning in The Sims 4: Seasons you either die outright or you can wield the power of electricity like a superhero\nYou can spy on the Grim Reaper (yes, Death himself) using a listening bug and hear his conversations\nNormally only child Sim characters can see elaborate imagination sequences playing out, but an adult with the childish trait can secretly view them too\nYou can complain about food poisoning and get compensation\nThe thread goes on for a long while, and it's great \"weekend reading\" material. It's essentially a series of Easter eggs and glitches/exploits, some of which yield some crazy results that are hilarious both in and out of context.\nEvery so often I dive back into The Sims and marvel at how well it's been supported over the years, and how many quality of life features have been implemented since launch. It doesn't hold my attention as much as a lot of other games, but it's a decent reminder of how great Maxis could be as a studio.\nThe post This Sims 4 fun fact thread is endlessly intriguing appeared first on Destructoid.",

Boop!\nThe National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) has announced that Koji Kondo's iconic Super Mario Bros. theme is to be inducted for preservation in the U.S. Library of Congress. The instantly recognizable ditty will be the first piece of video game music ever to join the NRPB's catalog of significant compositions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTa6Xbzfq1U&ab_channel=ultragamemusic\nEach year, the NRPB selects 25 pieces of music that it deems \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States\". I like to think that the Super Mario Bros. Theme falls into the latter category. Kondo's simple but endlessly entering tune — officially known upon conception as simply \"Ground Theme\" made its debut in World 1-1 of 1985 NES release Super Mario Bros. It has since been remixed and used endless times for various Nintendo titles, TV shows, and commercials.\nJoining Mario in the library this year will also be guitar shop nightmare \"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin, Madonna's censor bothering \"Like a Virgin\", Eurythmics \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\", John Lennon's \"Imagine\" and, from the goddess of winter herself, Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas is You\".

But Koei Tecmo confirms those rumors aren't accurate to Team Ninja's plans.\nSpeaking to Famitsu, Yasuda discussed Team Ninja's upcoming docket of games. The previously announced Rise of the Ronin is set for 2024. Yasuda also expresses a desire to release something new in 2025. The confusion arises around a certain phrasing, though.\n\"'Rise of the Ronin' has been under development for about 7 years and is scheduled to be released in 2024,\" Yasuda said. \"This work will be released in 2023, and I feel like I want to release a new title in 2025.\"\nFamitsu's interview was published online on March 11, after the release of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty earlier this year. This, alongside mention that the game in question was in development, led to speculation and reports that Team Ninja has another game planned for 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlmdeQFyqC0\nKoei Tecmo clarifies\nAs noted in Famitsu's article, though, this interview was conducted on February 14, 2023, prior to the launch of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. And the interview itself is about Wo Long, too.\nWe reached out to Team Ninja parent company Koei Tecmo to clarify, and a spokesperson confirmed that \"this work\" refers to Wo Long. The spokesperson also confirms their 2023 game is Wo Long, and Team Ninja does not have another full game planned for 2023.\nWhich, considering Wo Long still has a season pass' worth of content on the way alongside Rise of the Ronin and thoughts of a 2025 game, is probably a good thing. Team Ninja has had a steady cadence over the last few years.\nMeanwhile, Wo Long does sound like it's a pretty rad.

In addition to these announcements, Sunsoft also teased that it had a full remake in the works, but is yet to offer up the identity of the mystery title.\nNext week's stream is expected to feature new information pertaining to the above titles, and will perhaps see Sunsoft finally lift the lid on the teased remake. Of course, we may find that the studio is only planning to continue its focus on the Japanese market and some of its more obscure IPs, but it's still interesting to see the long-forgotten studio make its presence felt some 20-30 years later.

          "description": "Are you the keymaster?\nSecret Mode has announced that it’s bringing Sumo Digital Academy’s revival of the Amiga almost-classic Zool Redimensioned to PlayStation consoles on May 16, 2023.\nZool was originally released in 1992 on the Commodore Amiga before being ported to other consoles. Despite its availability on different platforms, it’s largely considered to be an Amiga cornerstone. 2021’s Zool Redimensioned was a ground-up remake that bases itself on the Amiga version. It features widescreen support, which is a pretty revolutionary change, considering it was a game that would sometimes punish quick movements.\nhttps://youtu.be/xTEsWEeVGm8\nI enjoyed it for what it was. It was a worthwhile update, but I don’t really think about Zool Redimensioned all that often anymore. In my review, I called it a “comfortable slice of ‘90s platforming,\" which still sounds appropriate to me now. Good call, past me.\nAlong with this port comes multiplayer in the form of party modes Zool’s Gold, Rool of Zool, and Ball Brawl. Not much has been shown off about them. The trailer shows off Rool of Zool, but it’s hard to really make out what’s happening. I see bosses though, so it kind of looks fun. The patch will also be coming to the existing PC version. My family won’t play platformers with me because I exist on a higher plain of skill in that genre. Every genre, really, but don’t tell them I said that.\nZool Redimensioned is currently available on PC, and will be making its way to PS4 and PS5 on May 16.\nThe post Zool Redimensioned is coming to PlayStation consoles May 16 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Prepare to get wet\nFuturlab has revealed its plans for the transcendental dad-game Powerwash Simulator for the rest of 2023. While a lot of these plans are currently just winks and eyebrow wiggles, it will at least give you an idea of what to look forward to.\nThe most concrete of plans is patch 1.2, which brings additional jobs and updates old ones to expand Powerwash Simulator’s mystifyingly deep lore. This is coming April 18, 2023, which is just around the corner, so you won’t have to wait long. This patch will be followed by another free content pack every quarter, including a “seasonal” one. While that will probably be Christmas Themed, I’d love to power-wash the feathers off a turkey.\nhttps://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1646151201237393412?s=20\nAlong with this is three paid DLC packs for Powerwash Simulator. They haven’t really said much on what those will involve, but they do say that they will take you outside the fictional county of Muckington to “all sorts of new and exciting places.” Space? The bottom of the ocean? How does a power washer work in a pressurized environment? Like normal, I’m guessing.\nThe biggest wink, however, is just “exciting news.” Ooo. I bet it’s VR, which really isn’t exciting to someone like me. Someone who doesn’t own a VR headset.\nThere’s also a physical version of the game on the way for consoles. I say “physical,” but the Switch version is just a download key, which is just… I don’t see the point. I should totally buy my dad the PS4 version, though.\nI love Powerwash Simulator, though. It’s like a less janky version of Viscera Cleanup Detail. I can barely keep my kitchen clean, but you can bet I’ll get every nook and cranny if you give me points for it.\nPowerwash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.\nThe post Futurlab shares its Powerwash Simulator roadmap for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

So relatable. That’s how Flooded begins.\nFlooded describes itself as a reverse city builder. What it means is that the world is currently undergoing flooding of biblical proportions, and you need to survive in small pockets of land, finish up your objectives, and escape before there’s no land left to dry your socks on. I wasn’t sure if this concept was really going to work for me, but now that I’ve played through Flooded, I realize that its design is not only palatable, but actually somewhat brilliant.\n[caption id=\"attachment_373383\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[…",

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torval. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.",

Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay?

That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.\nOfficially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. \n“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”\nMario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. \nThis is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.",

The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.",

          "description": "For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.\nSetting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.\nIssue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale.

There are no cars, people, or sounds to distract me. I can’t avoid what I’m seeing: a host of creatures about to be murdered.\nWe’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths.

          "description": "For April Fool's Day, Sega released a game where the company finally went and did the unthinkable: they killed Sonic. The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: \nIt's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?\nSurprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. \nOver 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.\npic.twitter.com/Cy2cIo2AHl\nApril 5, 2023\nThis all just goes to show – the world wants Sonic dead.",

As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.\nNew Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.\nSeveral new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.\nNew Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.\nAmong several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.\nIt’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.\nGod of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\nYou can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.",

While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.\nWhat's your favorite minigame in Pokémon Stadium? Let us know in the comments!",

It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.\nThe same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…",

Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. \nPGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.\nNancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.\nYou will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM.

While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
