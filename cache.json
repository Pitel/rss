          "description": "Here we go again...\nAbout this time last year, Sega released Sonic Origins—a compilation release that aimed to collate the first four (five if we count Sonic & Knuckles as a totally separate game) Mega Drive/Genesis Sonic games in one ultimate package with a bunch of extras thrown in. Though it wasn’t without its issues, Sega more or less managed to do what it set out to do, but there was a lingering sentiment amongst fans that it could’ve done much more. Now, a year later, Sega has decided to release a ‘Plus’ update — available as a DLC expansion or in physical form — that throws in a dozen new games and some other additional features to make the collection all the sweeter. Unfortunately, Sonic Origins still feels somewhat incomplete even after this update, but this new expansion is just about worth the money.\nFirst, a brief overview of what’s been added. The headlining new addition here is the inclusion of 12 8-bit Sonic games made for the Sega Game Gear, the colour handheld which once upon a time directly competed with Nintendo’s first Game Boy. Elsewhere, Amy has been added as a playable character in the headlining four games for this collection, and Knuckles has been added as a playable character to Sonic CD after his rather odd exclusion in last year’s release. On top of that, Plus throws in all the previously released DLC with the additional missions to tackle, and content for the museum. Check out our review of the base game if you want to hear about the base offering:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Takes flight from Apple Arcade.\nIn 2022, renowned creator and industry figure Yu Suzuki revealed that his development studio Ys Net was creating an arcade-style shooter exclusively for Apple Arcade. Now, publisher ININ Games has revealed that the very game — which is a love letter and spiritual successor to Suzuki's Space Harrier — is coming to consoles, including Switch, on 10th November. (Thanks, Gematsu!)\nAir Twister is a pretty interesting-looking shooter and was the first game released by Ys Net following Shenmue III. It caught our attention last year because of its similarities to Space Harrier, and Suzuki has also cited numerous influences from Sega rail shooters such as Panzer Dragoon and Rez. Instead of piloting a spaceship, you're a princess who rides a swan all while over-the-top music complete with choir singing (from Dutch composer Valensia) blast out of the speakers.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Listen, you are going to get to the end of this review and think to yourself, \"Isn't a 10/10 score, like, Zelda: Breath of the Wild? How can this 12-15 hour game that doesn't even have Hestu in it possibly match up?\" You are thinking that because you have not played Ghost Trick. Your life is about to change.\nFirst up, a bit of background. Ghost Trick is a one-off, standalone game from the man behind Ace Attorney, Shu Takumi. Originally released on the DS in 2010, it received a fair amount of praise from critics, but never went on to become a bestseller. Instead, it lodged deep in the hearts of everyone who did play it, becoming a cult favourite amongst those in the know, alongside other, similar(ly underappreciated) games from the same era like Hotel Dusk, The World Ends With You, and Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We see languages, and we want to decipher them, like the people who climb Mount Everest just because it's there. The languages in games like FEZ, Titan Souls, Heaven's Vault, 7 Days To End With You, and Noita, invite the player to try to crack them to reveal more of the game's lore, and players are often rewarded for doing so, even if it's usually just extra story. Translating the Fez language was literally the first thing I did, and it basically revealed the whole plot of the game before I'd even started. Oops!\nBut those game examples are all made on indie budgets. What happens when a gigantic, multi-billion-dollar company like Nintendo makes its own language?

They're a total game-changer that I couldn't go without - and thanks to this deal on Amazon US, soon you won't have to either. \nYou can currently pick up a dual-monitor stand that accommodates two monitors up to 32 inches in size or 17.6 pounds in weight for just $15 when you use code LHEMYSVN and you're an Amazon Prime member. That's an incredible deal for a dual monitor arm that normally costs $46 and comes with over 15,000 ratings with an average score of 90%. \nRead more",

This shift into the supernatural is quite the change for Mimimi, which creative director Dominik Abé tells me was partly to challenge themselves as designers, but also so players could have a bit more fun with how they approached its plentiful stealth encounters.\n\"One thing we wanted for sure was that we had something that's not grounded in a realistic setting,\" Abé tells me. \"That was a requirement for all the pitches we did internally, and that's because we wanted to improve on the gameplay. We were restricted by realism, so that was a core pillar. It had to be something fantasy, or sci-fi or something non-realistic.\"\nRead more",

Showdown was the mode's name; something for the animal fight pit lovers in the room, rather than the plain old animal lovers. That mode has now been spun into a free standalone release aptly called Temtem Showdown, out now. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past.

A PC version was specified in the game's announcement trailer, and then FF16 producer Yoshi-P walked it back and said that didn't happen, and then Yoshi-P addressed his previous words and said he'd like to bring the game to PC eventually. Just don't expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess?

In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I'm a drummer. \"Olivia, don't do that,\" my mum scolds me. \"Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child.\" Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.\r\n\nWell, 10 year old me, you're in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you'll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various \"effects\" of a non-culinary nature.\nRead more",

Growth is one of these, and I'm hooked on the demo that's playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process.

We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.\r\n\n\r\nMy poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But seeing as how they last about an hour and cost approximately the same as it would for Wales to secede from the United Kingdom, I can only afford to pay an immersive experience what it deserves every so often (the rest of the time I'm honourbound by my fatherland to donate to causes supported by Michael Sheen). I'm therefore pleased that there seems to be an uptick in escape room video games. Plese do more of those, developers.\nRead more",

          "description": "Next month's open beta for Frontier Developments' new Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin may be focused on testing its 1v1 multiplayer mode, but the Elite Dangerous studio have told me there's still plenty to look forward to in its single-player story campaign. I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they've been hard at work making sure it's \"filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven't seen before\". He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to \"really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling\", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.\nRead more",

It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.\nDark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?\nRead more",

The World War II iterations were my first introduction, but there are few shooters I've put as much time into as my family did on Battelfield 2. It was the perfect mix of progression, variety, strategy, and shooting. I mention this to underscore the praise I'm giving BattleBit Remastered when I say it reminds me of Battlefield 2.

The current number of Evo registrants seems to back up this popularity too, as the tournament organizer confirms Street Fighter 6 is breaking both franchise and all-time Evo player count records.\nShared on social media, the Evolution Championship Series says Street Fighter 6 has officially broken both a franchise and all-time Evo record for competitors.\nhttps://twitter.com/EVO/status/1673466628636561408\nEvo doesn't share how many players that is. But if we're judging by the previous record count of Street Fighter V at Evo 2016, that's over 5,000 registrants.\nSign-ups for Evo 2023 are still live for a little less than two weeks. Evo 2023 is set to run August 4 through 6 in Las Vegas, NV.\nBack in the saddle again\nI have to admit, it's nice to see Street Fighter thriving like this. Sure, Street Fighter V delivered some pretty great sets over the years. But it always felt like SFV couldn't get out from under its launch state.\nMeanwhile, Street Fighter 6 has been an absolute grand slam. As Moyse put it so well, Street Fighter 6 is \"a title that radiates excellence.\" And the players have been showing up, too. Alongside the big Evo numbers, this last week's CEO—where MenaRD took the top spot with both Luke and Blanka—also tallied up a ton of entrants.\nSafe to say that Street Fighter 6 has made its impact on the scene. I'm curious to see what these numbers look like moving forward, after the launch year luster wars off. But this year's Evo debut for SF6 promises to be a big one.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 breaks franchise and all-time Evo records for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The series won't stray from the game's basic premise.\n“Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone,\" reads the show's official logline. \"Root out the ‘Impostor’ or fall victim to its murderous designs.”\n[caption id=\"attachment_347219\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nTitmouse, the studio behind Big Mouth and, more appropriately, Star Trek: Lower Decks, will be in charge of animation. Ben Kalina from Titmouse will also have a role as co-executive producer.\nWe're yet to hear about networks or streaming platforms interested in the project, but we doubt that'll take long. This is a big property, and the show has The Animation Guild behind it, not the WGA. Its production likely won't slow down due to the WGA strike.\nAnyone who wants to know more about what the Among Us show might have in store should check out Infinity Train. It's a marvelously heartwarming animated show that tells the story of a bunch of great characters until the moment they all die via the scythe of unfair cancellation. Just kidding. Though the cancellation did happen and was absolutely unfair, none of Infinity Train's stories ended on cliffhangers. You should totally check it out.\nVideo game adaptations have finally begun to get things right with Arcane and The Last of Us. Here's hoping CBS continues the trend with its take on Among Us. \nThe post Among Us animated TV series in the works at CBS appeared first on Destructoid.",

This means that the Atelier Ryza series has moved over 400,000 more units in a period filled with massive attention-stealers such as Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Street Fighter VI, and Diablo IV. Now that's quite the feat.\n[caption id=\"attachment_365614\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via Koei Tecmo[/caption]\nTo celebrate the series' success, Koei Tecmo has announced that they're willing to give out some goodies to fans; too bad that only applies to fans living in Japan.\nAre you just hearing about the Atelier series for the first time? Then you'll probably be surprised to learn that this series has existed since '97. (That's older than Metal Gear Solid.) Atelier is a popular RPG series that began on Sony consoles, then gradually made its way to most other platforms. The Ryza games in the series follow Reisalin \"Ryza\" Stout. Ryza is an adventurer who travels the world looking for recipes to further her studies in the field of alchemy.\nYou can play either of the three newest games in the series on PS5, Xbox X|S, Switch, and Steam. The success of Atelier Ryza will likely not slow down anytime soon either, as an anime TV adaptation will come out this summer.\nThe post Atelier Ryza series clears two million shipments appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previously, this was an Apple Arcade exclusive. It will be arriving on November 10, 2023.\nDo you not even have phone? I do, but I rarely play phone. So, typically, when something like Air Twister gets announced, the news just bounces off of me and gets filed away in the trash compactor of my mind. So, when I got the PR for this, I was like, “I’ve seen this before,” but I couldn’t place it. I had to look up news of it, and thankfully, CJ plays phone and had written about it previously.\nSo, there’s this trailer, and I really can’t tell what the hell is going on, so I’m just going to quote what the press release tells me, “In Air Twister, embark on an epic quest with Princess Arch as she fights to save her planet from imminent destruction.”\nhttps://youtu.be/-eUpnDtU274\nOkay, cool, now explain the winged elephant to me.\nYu Suzuki is the mind behind Space Harrier, After Burner, Out Run, and Shenmue. One of those games is among my favorite titles ever, and it’s probably not the one that you’re thinking of.\nI can’t find a lot on Air Twister in terms of reviews, but the ones I do find are kind of lukewarm. However, CJ says it got much better after a few updates. I’d be willing to try it out myself once it’s off of phone. It looks absolutely insane. Like someone dropped a whole bunch of unrelated assets into a blender and hit “frappe.” I like insane.\nAir Twister is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on November 10, 2023.

We don't yet know when it's coming out, but eagle-eyed gamers think the developer is preparing for its launch.\nOver on SteamDB (as spotted by Twitter user and known leaker Wario64), a website that tracks all things related to Steam, it looks as though Resident Evil 4 is getting seven new achievements added to the game. There are no details on what these achievements actually are as they're marked as hidden, but some speculate they could be related to the DLC.\nhttps://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1673334239352311814\nOther theories suggest it could be in relation to the VR version of the Resident Evil 4 remake. All of these are, of course, speculations. Hopefully, Capcom will give further details at some point. In any case, it's something to keep a close eye on. It looks as though RE4 is preparing for a new patch, but we can't be sure of the details at this stage.

You do not need to purchase the previous Temtem game in order to access Temtem: Showdown.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388841\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Humble Games[/caption]\nGotta battle em' all!\nTemtem: Showdown takes out the taming and leveling from the base game, and focuses purely on the combat. Dubbed a \"free multiplayer battle simulator\", players can build a team in seconds and dash into ranked matches with players from all over the world. At its core, Temtem's battle system features action-packed 2v2 battles. It'll feel familiar to anyone who's played a bit of doubles in online Pokémon matches.\nCompetitive play seems to be a huge part of the game, featuring a climbable ranked ladder system. Furthermore, the game will have community-run tournaments as well as an official esports circuit called TemCS. According to to the Steam page, the circuit will reward huge prizes.\nSeasons will also be a thing in Temtem: Showdown. There will be a new season every few months, changing up the meta and introducing new combinations to play with when doing battle.\nI haven't got a chance to play Temtem yet, though it's in my backlog to play on PS5. I have heard great things about its battle system though, so this seems like the right idea to make it accessible to more players. While Temtem is available on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, it looks like Temtem: Showdown is only available via Steam for now.\nIf you want to give the game a try, you can check out Temtem: Showdown now for free on Steam.\nThe post Temtem: Showdown is a free, battle-focused Temtem game out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

I will never understand the appeal of centering an entire property around a character deliberately created to be annoying. He’s like Bugs Bunny, except you never feel the need to root for him. No, he’s more like Batman’s Joker, but you replace all the charisma with just a second heaping of insane malice. I hate him so much.\nSo, I bought a game that headlines him. It’s 2000’s Woody Woodpecker Racing for PS1 and Windows. I bought this specifically so I could remind my brain that it’s trapped here in this hell with me.

Announced during the Summer Game Fest 2023 live show, Sand Land is an interesting pick for an ILCA-developed, Bandai Namco-published action-RPG adaptation.\nWhile many in the west are familiar with Akira Toriyama's work, Sand Land isn't quite as popular as, say, Dragon Ball. But that relative disparity is what made Sand Land interesting to me. I've seen tons of Dragon Ball. I don't know much about Sand Land.

Pre-orders are now open for limited edition Oreo x Super Mario cookies. And I don’t know how I can remain shocked that this is where the FOMO market has gotten us.\nA pack of Orea x Super Mario includes 12 cookies, and there are 16 designs in all. Of the 16 embossed designs, one of them features Luigi, and none of them depicts Monty Mole. If you eat the entire package by yourself, you’ll be treating yourself to 720 calories and immeasurable shame.\nOreos are also challenging you to balance the allegedly rare Bowser cookie on the edge of a glass and then stack all the other characters on top of it until it all collapses. I guess this is a social media thing. No prize has been announced, but they say, \"The Oreo brand may even have a surprise in store for fans who rise to the challenge, defeat Bowser and save the Mushroom Kingdom.\" Oh, gosh, there's a trailer on the site.\nHuh. Oreos definitely aren’t bad cookies, and I have no problems with product marketing. This just seems a bit extra. Preorders for a Cookie? Maybe this is normal, and I'm the one who's out of touch. It reminds me of the Super Mario Cereal, where the box was also an Amiibo. I still have never seen a physical box of that stuff. It disappeared the moment it hit the shelf. Even still, I wouldn’t have pre-ordered it.\nIf you do want to pre-order some cookies, there’s a limit of 1 per order. That means your pre-order can’t possibly net you all 16 designs. Weird. However, they will appear in stores like any normal cookie. Their release into the world begins on July 10, 2023.\nThe post You can pre-order your limited edition Mario Oreos appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, for those of you who have yet to play it, now seems like a good time, as it's currently on offer for ridiculously cheap. With Starfield still a few months away, you might want something to do until then. And let's face it, we've all pretty much had our fill of Skyrim.\nSo how much is Fallout 4 at the moment? Head on over to the Steam page and you'll see that you can pick up the vanilla copy of the game for $6.59 (or £5.27 for our British readers). That's a pretty magnificent 67% off the usual price. But it doesn't end there, either.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388625\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]\nSay you fancy \"going big\" and you want the Game of the Year edition. Well, that too is on sale, now priced at $9.99 (or £8.74). The GOTY version of Fallout 4 comes with all the official expansions, including Far Harbor and Nuka-World.\nYou'll need to be a little quick though if you want to take advantage of the promotion, as it ends on June 29. That still gives you a few days to make a purchase, but it's not going to be around for long.\nBut let's say you don't fancy playing Fallout 4. Maybe you've already got a copy of it and you've been playing it to death since 2015. Well, you might be interested in hearing about the Fallout: London. This is a fan project that, as the name suggests, tells a F4 story in England's capital city.

The fan-made modification takes TES4 and rebuilds it in TES5's engine, and the scope of this project is one for the ages. Now, the volunteers working on this unofficial remake has shared a new video that shows the current progress plus what's left to do.\nThe 10-minute footage over on YouTube is essentially a checklist of how much has been done on Skyblivion since work began in 2012. While there's still a way to go, So far the team has managed to map around 82% of Oblivion's world. On top of that, roughly 40% of the interiors have been done, a third of the \"meshing\" is now complete, and nearly 100 quests are described as \"playable\".\nhttps://youtu.be/H1q1nXLDjB8\nThe video also shows how much is still left, with a staggering amount of work still ahead for the modders. They're also calling out for additional help, so if you feel you have the skills and want to contribute towards Skyblivion's success, you can become a volunteer.\nThe team also recently celebrated eight years of continuous work that's gone into the project.

          "description": "Back on the shores of hell\nIn 2020, Nightdive Studios released a source port of the oft-forgotten Doom 64 that brought it to modern platforms and reintroduced it to a new, more receptive audience. Beyond simply porting it, however, they added a new episode that better links it to the rest of the Doom series narrative. Now fans have implemented the new episode back into the N64 version as Doom 64: Complete Edition.\nThis means that if you, for whatever reason (not judging), preferred the N64 version of Doom 64, you can play it again without sacrificing the extra features of Nightdive Studios’ source port. This all sounds really difficult, since the 2020 version runs on Nightdive’s proprietary Kex Engine. I’m assuming the maps still exist in an extractable format because I imagine it would be too much work to try to manually recreate them for a release such as this.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388694\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via MobyGames[/caption]\nBeyond simply adding the extra maps, Doom 64: Complete Edition adds a number of quality-of-life upgrades. You can find them at this link. One of the most important revisions for me, however, is the ability to disable three-point texture filtering. This was what was mostly to blame for everything on the N64 looking blurry. They also improved the framerate in some areas and enabled support for the Expansion Pak upgrade. That’s some good stuff!\nIf you haven’t played Doom 64, it’s definitely worth checking out. It always had its fans, but Nightdive’s port helped force a wider re-assessment of Midway’s contribution to the series. Personally, I don’t think it’s better than Doom, but I might put it above Doom 2. However, it has its own style and approach to the series’ formula.\nThe Doom 64: Complete Edition fan patch can be found here.\nThe post Doom 64 fan mod adds Nightdive’s new episode to N64 version appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yep, only one of the games in the \"trilogy\" will be included physically, and you'll need to download the rest. Don't just take it from me, read the entire FAQ entry on the game's official site:\nDoes the Nintendo Switch physical version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy include all three games on one cartridge?\nBatman: Arkham Asylum will be included on the Batman: Arkham Trilogy game cartridge. Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight will require an online connection to download and install both titles when the Batman: Arkham Trilogy cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console. All three games will then be playable as long as the cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console.\n\nWelp! At least you get \"all previously released DLC\" with that download when it comes out this fall!\nThis is part of a longer trend for third-party games\nAlthough The Witcher 3 managed to cram the game on a higher-capacity cart, many third-party Switch games have suffered the same fate as the Arkham Trilogy. In fact, Arkham wasn't the only series that's fending off criticism in that very same Nintendo Direct, as Konami revealed that Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 would also require massive downloads.\nStart clearing up your SD space now if you're partaking in either of them later this year.\nThe post Batman: Arkham Trilogy only has one game on the cart on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, there may be longer to wait still, as even the Head of Xbox Gaming, Phil Spencer, admits he doesn't even know what platform it's going to be on. There may be a few more years to go until the anticipated sequel ever sees the light of day.\nAnd exactly how long are we talking? Well, according to journalist Stephen Totilo, (reporting on the Microsoft/Activision court case), Spencer npted that Elder Scrolls 6 could be \"five-plus years away.\" If true, this would put the elusive Skyrim follow-up on track for a 2028 release at the earliest. As such, it could mean that the long-awaited Bethesda RPG is actually on deck for gaming's next generation.\nhttps://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1672314548995366935\nAccording to a recent report from The Verge, Spencer did say in a 2021 interview that it will be exclusive to Xbox, though it doesn't necessarily mean it will be this generation's Xbox. When questioned about this today, the executive doesn't recall ever making such a statement. And so, it stands, we're not really any closer to understanding what's happening with the next Elder Scrolls installment. A couple of years ago, Todd Howard said the game was still in early development.\nAll we can really hope is that once Starfield is released this September, then Bethesda will be willing to spill a few more beans. We can assume that, for now, the studio is just keeping its cards close to its chest.\nThe post The Elder Scrolls 6 could still be ‘five-plus’ years away appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Detective Pikachu Returns, and Mario RPG are at the top\nA little less than a week ago, Nintendo once again showed us the staying power of the Direct, and gave us a ton of announcements and a few surprise releases. We have a full recap here, but if you're a visual learner, Nintendo recently tweeted out a full infographic of what was announced or reconfirmed; with the first-party cream rising to the top.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388663\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nIf I had to guess what would win a \"most excited\" poll, it would be Mario RPG\nI'm still cautiously optimistic about Super Mario Bros. Wonder (I hope the gimmicks are more than skin-deep), but based on the almost universally-positive reaction to the Super Mario RPG revival, I'd say that takes the highest hype spot. I mean, it's at the top of my list too! Re-releasing Pikmin 1 and 2 was a genius move as well, as you can get the entire mainline Pikmin series on one platform now. That's kind of become a calling card for the Nintendo Switch: a successor to the 3DS in its own right, collecting both old, new, and new-again games in one spot.\nAs for Detective Pikachu Returns, it's in a super weird spot. We're years removed from the film, and I'm the only person I know who actually played the original Detective Pikachu from start to finish. It'll be interesting to see how the game performs, and if it gets another gigantic amiibo.\nThe post Here are all the recent Nintendo Direct games coming to Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Battle Beyond the Stars\nBethesda has confirmed that the \"Constellation Edition\" of its upcoming space opera Starfield will not contain an actual disc of the game itself, and will instead feature a download code for the chosen platform. The publisher noted this controversial development in a tweet from its support team.\n\"Hello!\" said the team, responding directly to a fan's question. \"All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs\". The tweet has since been deleted from Twitter.\nThe community understandably responded unhappily to the news, with some decrying the return of \"non-physical physical editions\", while others pointed to the continued slant toward a future where archiving games becomes a much-more-difficult venture without hard copies of the games themselves. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with some, (some as Twitter's Wario64), pointing out that certain adverts for Starfield's physical release had clearly stated that a disc was included.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYEiTdsyas\nThe removal of the initial tweet suggested that there were crossed wires somewhere along the chain of communication. And that indeed proved to be the case, as it now seems that while the standard edition of Starfield will feature a physical disc including game code, it is purely the $250 Constellation Edition that will not — a digital download code for the title being issued as part of this version. And so, anybody who wishes to pick up the Collector's Edition and own a physical disc of the sci-fi spectacle will, at this stage, be required to pick up both versions.\nStarfield launches September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X/S.\nThe post Starfield collector’s edition will not include an actual disc appeared first on Destructoid.",

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.\nDuring any cutscene in FFXVI, you can hold the tou…",

We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. \nWhat’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added. \n\n\nHere’s a look at the top 10 best …",

The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. \nFort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. \nFor more, check out the Fort Solis reveal trailer from last year.\nAre you playing Fort Solis this August?

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

Bond claimed in court that, in the leadup to the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S generation of hardware in 2020, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said his company did not intend to put Call of Duty – presumably new, upcoming ones – on the Xbox platform unless Microsoft shared more revenue. \n\n\n\"Time was limited,\" Bond said in court, according to IGN. \"We had players whose expectations w…",

The update was announced in November 2022 as part of the game's 2023 roadmap.\nThe Sonic's Birthday Bash update adds new challenges, moves, and a new kind of collectible Koco for Sonic. The update also promises free birthday decorations for our hero, as well as the addition of New Game Plus. As is standard with most New Game Plus modes, you can begin the adventure from the start with all of your skill tree and power-up levels carried over into the new file.\nSonic's Birthday Bash arrives free to download beginning today at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. The first of three content updates arrived in March, adding a photo mode, Cyber Space Challenges, and Battle Rush mode, plus a jukebox featuring collectible songs from Sonic's past. The third update, which promises to be the most substantial, adds new playable characters and a new story and is set to arrive later this year.

As you might imagine, today's Sonic Central also shined a spotlight on the highly anticipated 2D Sonic game. We received a new trailer that showed off some new DLC coming to Sonic Superstars that features a collaboration with the Lego brand.\nPlayers will be able to download a free Lego Sonic DLC skin to give the Blue Blur a new, bricky look. In addition, those who preorder Sonic Superstars will receive a Lego Eggman skin as well. You can see the new trailer below.\n\n\nWhile Sonic is a recent addition to the Lego stable of characters, he appeared in the 2015 toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions, where he received specialized stages geared towards the speedy playstyle. However, it wasn't until 2021 that Lego officially greenlit a fan creation featuring Green Hill Zone from Sonic Mania. Then, earlier this year, Lego announced four new Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets, which will be available in August.\nSonic Superstars arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. \nLocalization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region.

Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. \nHowever, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.\n\n\nToday's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\" \n\"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you,\" Hines said, according to IGN.\nBethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today. \n[Source: IGN]\nEditor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.",

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got our first details on Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass DLC, which is set to hit within the next couple of months.\nBooster Course Pass Wave 5 will feature an all-new course in the bathroom-themed Squeaky Clean Sprint, as well as three new characters. Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.\n\n\nWave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer.

The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. \n\n\nThis enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks.

During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.\nWhile the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider.

From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.\n\n\nThe main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.\nYou'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.\nFinally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.\nIf you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.",

          "description": "Last February, Game Freak revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet had DLC in the works, but all we got to show for it was a few pieces of concept art and static images of new Pokémon. Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.\n\n\nTitled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.\nThe first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.\nWhile the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.\nNo specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.",

          "description": "Immortals of Aveum was revealed with a short teaser trailer at the 2022 Game Awards. The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.\nYou can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.\nAs you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.\nThe recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.\nFor more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here.

What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry.

          "description": "Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.\nJust to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.\nJune 18, 2023\nHere, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be \"deeply involved\" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will \"introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe,\" according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.\nIn addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:\nGiven the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.",

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
