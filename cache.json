Specialising in accessible throwbacks, it adds a fresh spin on old genre formats. Although its latest title Ravenlok is (pun intended) locked away behind Xbox exclusivity, Switch owners can finally try the second in the dev's self-styled ‘Voxel Trilogy’ - Echo Generation.\nA nostalgic and charmingly funny adventure/RPG hybrid, it takes the beautiful voxel style of the developer's 2019 title Riverbond, and applies it to the bizarre summer holiday of a group of suburban kids. Tipping a hat to the point-and-click classics of Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer, there's also more than a little reminder of EarthBound in its creepy view of suburbia.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Child's play.\nWalking into the Devolver’s booth for The Plucky Squire at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we felt like we were going back to our childhood. There was a huge, colourful mural on the wall, depicting All Possible Future’s upcoming adventure game in front of us. A cute, cosy couch was positioned to our left; soft plush, and a deep orangey-red. There was a bright geometric-print rug on the floor. And a little desk with a book titled ‘The Plucky Squire’, written by E.N. Arthur and published by Peanut, was tucked in the corner. The finishing touch? A big TV with the game glowing from the screen, an Xbox controller, and a PC tucked away in a cabinet. It felt like the childhood den of our dreams.\nThe book itself was empty – sorry to James Turner, co-director of The Plucky Squire, that we’ve revealed the secret – but that’s kind of the point. The Plucky Squire is a game about discovering the story of hero Jot, preserving that story, and saving creativity, all to preserve the innocence and imagination of kids. In the game itself, it’s a boy called Sam, whose favourite book is the titular tome, but in reality, we couldn’t help but think of kids everywhere and want to protect that creativity that youth gives us – and that age can sometimes take away.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "So much more than \"Sanrio meets Animal Crossing\".\n“One World, Connecting Smiles.” That’s the tagline Sanrio, the company responsible for creating Hello Kitty, established back in 2021. Its brand is all about 'Minna Nakayoku', which means 'all of us friends' or 'Getting Along Together'. Unity, friendship, and love encompass the world of Sanrio, and it’s worked. For me, Hello Kitty has always been that unifying figure – an icon, kind of like a cuter Barbie, who is capable of anything but always puts her friends first. I had Hello Kitty Dream World figures, where the eponymous cat had a mushroom house, a pineapple juice bar (complete with a pineapple-costumed figure), and even a dolphin yacht. There was also a bee costume figure with detachable bee wings. What’s not to love?\nHello Kitty is one of the biggest brands in the world (for context, Hello Kitty grossed more merch money than Frozen, Batman, and Sesame Street in 2018). So it might be a surprise that she’s never really had a successful video game, despite starring in many, dating all the way back to the Famicom. That is, until 2023’s Hello Kitty Island Adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.\n \nRead more",

And every \"yersel\" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became \"yourself\". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to \"International English\" for its captions.

For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there's a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.\r\n \nRead more",

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster.

It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type.

It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines.

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.\nRead more",

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating.

When building a kernel targeted for a specific device/platform with a given number of CPU cores, the compiler can optimize CPU mask routines and shrink the size of the resulting kernel image rather than having to accommodate up to a dynamic upper-limit for the number of CPU cores to be found at boot time. Linus Torvalds himself has turned to demoting this CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS option further to avoid confusion...",

It’s a rather powerful one, so let's take a closer look at it.\n\n\nTheatre is a Legendary Shikai Element. This means that it has a drop rate of 3%. Once you receive your Shikai, if it’s not the one you want (which I assume is Theatre in this case) you’ll need to use a reroll to try your luck again.\n\n\nGetting Shikai is an early task for Shinigami. For full instructions, you can check here. Then in order to get Bankai, you’ll need to jump a great many more hurdles, which are outlined right over here.\n\n\nShikai\n\n\nZ - Kageoni - This causes you to teleport behind your opponent with an opening attack. It will ragdoll the opponent and can be followed up with a combo.\n\n\nX - Wraith - A quicker but less flashy teleport that will move you in front of your opponent with an attack.\n\n\nC - Iro Oni - This puts you in a stance. If your opponent hits you while you’re in this stance, you’ll teleport (of course) and hit them from behind, causing them to ragdoll.\n\n\nBankai\n\n\nT - Plague - This is an AOE (area of effect) move that will mark all the enemies in your vicinity. After a few moments, it will stun and damage the enemies.\n\n\nG - Final Play - This has a long(ish) windup that then releases a massive slash in front of your character.

          "description": "In the right hands, Hollowburden in Type Soul can be a deadly weapon. It has a two-staged crit that can be difficult to defend against if you land it correctly. Our tier list has it at an A rank only because it requires a particular build.\n\n\nHollowburden is a Mythic weapon, which means it’s among the rarest in Type Soul with a 3% drop rate. In order to get Hollowburden, you need to be on the Arrancar path, meaning you need to be a Hollow. These come from pulls using Hollow Boxes gained by buying them after a raid. Unfortunately, there isn’t much you can do to improve your chances of getting one, so you’ll need to grind raids until you get lucky.\n\n\nOtherwise, you can try to find someone to trade with. If you have a different Mythic weapon and would prefer to swap it out for a Hollowburden, you may be able to find someone who will oblige.\n\n\nHow to use Hollowburden in Type Soul\n\n\nIf you manage to get your hands on Hollowburden, then you may find it a bit unwieldy to use. Generally, you want to be using Kendo because it provides useful skills to supplement its somewhat weird function.\n\n\nEssentially, Hollowburden’s critical will cause your character to leap backward pretty far. As I mentioned earlier, however, it’s a two-stage critical, so recasting will jump you back forward in a follow-up attack.\n\n\nIt’s a strange maneuver. Some players favor it, others can’t get a handle on it. Considering its rarity, it can be disappointing if you don’t click with it, so consider this your warning.\n\nThe post How to get Hollowburden in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Raven Software has dropped a nerf to reduce the effectiveness of C4 explosives, and while some Warzone players are delighted, a vocal group is not pleased with the decision. \n\n\nIn a tweet late on June 18, Raven confirmed they had \"shipped a minor update that includes changes to C4.\" The patch reduced the explosive's throw velocity by 15%, brought its radius down from eight to seven meters, and toned down outer radius damage from 155 to 138. \n\n\n\n\nC4 has always been useful, and at times has been dominant in the meta. Most often, they are used to eliminate downed opponents, as you can simply throw one in the general direction of an injured enemy, press your trigger, and blow them back to the lobby. \n\n\nRecently though, they've been used more often as an offensive weapon against opponents who are not downed, and players were complaining about their range and the damage output, so it's no surprise that many of the comments in response were in favor. \n\n\nHowever, there were dissenting voices too, with some calling it \"lame,\" while others suggesting they should have been focusing on other things, like the upcoming nerf for the Kar98k or issues with anti-cheat or the game's party system. \n\n\nFor some, the nerfs simply don't go far enough, with a player named Tom responding: \"That's barely a change at all, still going to be overpowered.\"\n\n\nStill, it's an improvement on days gone by, when the C4 was so powerful that you couldn't spot an opponent without seeing a C4 flying through the air toward you. This nerf isn't going to make them unusable, but should make them a little more balanced. If you can throw one and get it at your enemy's feet, you'll still be able to blow them to smithereens, so I wouldn't suggest ditching them from your loadouts just yet. \n\nThe post Warzone devs have nerfed C4 explosives, and the community is split appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3 is full of interesting opportunities to jam out to Metallica music, drive cars through high-speed portals, and take over massive war buses. If you're looking to defeat some bosses and get your hands on some fun turrets, then the War Bus is what you're looking for.\n\n\nWhere to find a War Bus in Fortnite\n\n\nDuring your matches, you can find a War Bus accompanying one of two NPCs: The Machinist and Megalo Don. When you first enter your Fortnite match, you'll find the two boss icons on your map. They'll either sit in their respective bases and defend their territory or patrol the map alongside the War Bus. Your goal is to spot one that's patrolling the map and land near them without getting bombarded by turrets and NPC shots.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you approach a patrolling group, you'll typically spot the Machinist or Megalo Don driving their cars, with the War Bus following close behind. They'll all become hostile when you approach, so watch your shields and health to make sure you don't get eliminated immediately. You may also spot players nearby, so watch for them, too.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDepending on your current quest goal, you may be looking to ride on the War Bus, take damage, or inflict damage to it. The easiest way to deal damage to it is to shoot at it, use Nitro Fists against it, or crash down using Ride the Lightning. Alternatively, if you're fine with taking some damage, you can let it run you over or let nearby NPCs use the War Bus turrets. \n\n\nAs for riding the War Bus, you'll have to eliminate the NPCs controlling the turrets before using them yourself. Using the turret will complete the weekly quest instantly, allowing you to either use the turrets to attack others or quickly hop off and continue with the rest of the match.\n\nThe post How to find a War Bus in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Elixir in Roblox’s Type Soul is an item that, er, itemizes Ultra Skills. That is to say, it will turn an Ultra Skill into an item. You can then hand that item over to other players or just hold onto it to save for later. It’s an Ultra Skill in your pocket.\n\n\nThe bad news is that Black Elixir is a Mythical rarity item. To get it, you need to participate in clan wars and hope for the best. You can also trade for it if you can find a player magnanimous enough to accept a trade.\n\n\nThe better way to get it, on the other hand, is to use a code. You can check our code guide to see if one is available now. At the time of writing, you can get a Powered Black Elixir, which I’ll explain in a moment.\n\n\nAs a note, Black Elixir doesn’t work on Formless or Yamato. If you try, it will just fail, and the Black Elixer will be gone, which sounds painful.\n\n\nHow to get Powered Black Elixir in Type Soul\n\n\nThere’s an upgraded Black Elixir in Type Soul, the Powered Black Elixir. This is similar to the basic Black Elixir, but it instead turns your Fighting Style into an item. Again, this is so you can trade it or just keep it in your pocket to reapply later.\n\n\nTo get Powered Black Elixir, you’ll need to visit Myrnite in Karakura Town. You’ll find them out in the greenhouses wearing a white suit. Not the best outfit to do gardening in. Myrnite won’t talk to you unless you have the Black Elixir in your inventory, as well as 350,000 kan. They will then take your money and provide you with Powered Black Elixir.\n\n\nAgain, the alternative to this rigamarole is to get a player to trade it to you, which probably will be even more expensive.\n\nThe post How to get Black Elixir in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've been keeping up with Elden Ring's spin-off manga, Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, you may be disappointed to know that it will be skipping next month's update. However, the author has a perfectly understandable and relatable reason... he wants to play Shadow of the Erdtree.\n\n\nFor anyone who wasn't aware, Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree is an adaptation of the game, but is more of a comedy story starring an original protagonist. It's been getting new chapters biweekly; in fact, a new one dropped earlier today. As spotted by Automaton, author Nikiichi Tobita has opted to take some time off to enjoy the new Elden Ring DLC, which is scheduled to launch tomorrow (or on Friday depending on your timezone). This means the manga won't be getting a new chapter on July 19 as initially expected.\n\n\n\n\nYou can't be mad with him for his decision. How many of us have booked time off work to play a hot, new video game? How many of us have booked time off specifically for Shadow of the Erdtree? People have been clamouring for more Elden Ring since the game launched in 2022 and, based on all the reviews, it sounds like the wait will be worth it. Plus, writing and drawing manga chapters on a regular basis must be exhausting work, so Tobita is probably due a break anyway. Playing the DLC may also give him new ideas for future manga chapters.\n\n\nWould you believe this isn't even the only Elden Ring manga? Just last week, publisher Bandai Namco announced a second one titled Elden Ring: Distant Stories from The Lands Between (via Famitsu) and while it'll also be a comedy, the focus will be on the various NPCs players have met in the Lands Between. Serialisation will begin on July 4, but there's no mention of an official English translation. Since Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree has been localised for Western fans, hopefully this second manga will follow suit.\n\nThe post Even the Elden Ring manga author is taking time off to play Shadow of the Erdtree appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Video game remakes are all the rage nowadays, and with the Fallout series enjoying a boon in popularity thanks to the Amazon TV show, some might think Bethesda should put out a remake of one of the older Fallout games. Especially since Fallout 5 won't be a thing for a very, very, very long time. Surprisingly, Bethesda's own Todd Howard has shot down the possibility of remaking either of the first two Fallout games.\n\n\nEarlier this week, Howard spoke with YouTuber MrMattyPlays about the future of the Fallout series (via VGC), where he was asked if Bethesda would ever remake the original Fallout games. Those first two games are quite different to their successors, being isometric turn-based RPGs. Ever since Bethesda bought the IP from InterPlay Productions, though, the Fallout games have been…",

          "description": "Warzone has a storied history of \"pay to win\" weapons and skins that have dominated the meta, and YouTuber and expert JoeWo thinks he's discovered the latest in that long line of annoyingly good guns. \n\n\nIf you've purchased the Season 4 Battle Pass, you may have noticed the Poisoned Caress BlackCell blueprint for the AMR9. While it may not look like anything too special to begin with, this special version of the SMG comes with one very specific upgrade: The iron sights. \n\n\n\"It makes the iron sights absolutely broken,\" the YouTuber explained. \"That is the number one problem with the AMR9, [they're] probably the worst in Call of Duty history if you don't have this blueprint. They're absolutely horrible.\"\n\n\nWith the blueprint attached, however, JoeWo says the changed iron sights are \"some of the cleanest we have for any SMG.\" You can take a look at the video below, timestamped to 29:31, to compare. \n\n\n\n\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea, then JoeWo also dropped the meta loadout for the gun right now, so you can put together the best class to make the most of the newly improved sights. The blueprint can be found in Sector 11 of the Battle Pass.\n\n\n\nMuzzle: ZEHM35 Compensated Flash Hider\n\n\nUnderbarrel: XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop\n\n\nStock: JAK Cut Throat\n\n\nRear Grip: Phantom Grip\n\n\nMagazine: 50 Round Mag\n\n\n\nWhile this definitely has a big advantage over the regular version of the gun, the good news is that it isn't super overpowered like other \"pay-to-win\" items in the past. Who can forget the notorious Roze skin that blended into the shadows, or the Gaia skin which was almost impossible to see at times?

          "description": "Since XDefiant first launched, players have been begging for Team Deathmatch to be added as a game mode. An overwhelming wave of demand worked, as Ubisoft finally confirmed its addition. \n\n\nUbisoft confirmed that Team Deathmatch goes live as a new game mode on June 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Playing the objective is fun and often rewarding when it leads to a victory for your team. However, sometimes, when you log on, you would rather turn your brain off and strictly go after enemies. Team Deathmatch is the perfect game mode for players seeking out that experience.  \n\n\nTeam Deathmatch is a classic first-person shooter game mode in which the only objective is to get as many kills as possible. The winner of the match is the team that reaches the point limit first or the squad that has the most kills at the end of the time limit. As in the case with other titles such as Modern Warfare 3, this game mode will probably be one of the most played game modes when it goes live. \n\n\n\n\nXDefiant features two different types of maps. Arena environments are designed for game modes like Occupy and Hot Shot, as they are smaller and ideal for fast-paced battles. On the other hand, liner maps are more tailored for modes like Escort and Zone Control because the game modes demand a larger battlefield. Ubisoft did not reveal which maps the game mode will be available on, but it will most likely only be available on arena maps, based on the criteria. \n\n\nAs for other highly requested game modes, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin previously confirmed on June 5 that Search and Destroy will be added in a future update. \n\nThe post XDefiant finally confirms Team Deathmatch game mode thanks to community requests appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and his team at Mistwalker, including legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu, combined forces once again to unleash Fantasian on Apple Arcade in two parts in 2021. Naturally, that means the audience was inherently limited, but now that it's finally expanding to other platforms, Sakaguchi shared some thoughts. \n\n\nIn a statement on Fantasian's official English social accounts, Sakaguchi started off by saying that he always wanted Fantasian to be an \"especially long-standing title,\" and he cites that longevity as one of the strengths of digital games. \"I developed Fantasian thinking that it could become my final work before retiring, so it has a special place in my heart,\" he continued. \n\n\n\n\nSakaguchi added that being able to rebuild Fantasian at Square Enix and offer it to a wider audience is \"truly a blessing.\" Beyond the exploration and turn-based combat, a lot of the appeal of Fantasian comes down to its beautifully bespoke nature. The backgrounds consist of hand-crafted dioramas, over 150 of which were scanned into the game. Sakaguchi closed out his statement with a nod to all this loving, laborious work, saying, \"This title is an amalgamation of the souls of the diorama craftsmen, Uematsu compositions, and of course, the game developers.\" \n\n\nThe soul of fantasy\n\n\nScreenshot via Square Enix\n\n\nSquare Enix is helping Sakaguchi and his team revitalize the RPG as Fantasian Neo Dimension. The new version keeps the story and gameplay intact while adding in some additional features, including English and Japanese voiceovers and more difficulty options. It's currently set for a 2024 release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\n\nAs great as exclusives can be, it's even better when more people have a chance to enjoy a game you've worked so hard on over the years. Here's hoping this is far from Sakaguchi's final fantasy.\n\nThe post Fantasian creator Hironobu Sakaguchi considers the RPG’s wider release a ‘blessing’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

D'Onofrio feels unsure at the moment about how and where the future of Wilson Fisk will be and explains that it is due to the interchanging rights of the characters between Sony and Marvel.\n\n\nThe actor shared his thoughts on the situation amid rumors of his involvement in the upcoming Disney+ show called Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Charlie Cox is already confirmed to be reprising his role as Daredevil in the animated series.\n\n\n\n\n“I'm going to transparently say this: You know the whole Marvel-Sony thing, right? So there are characters — Marvel characters invented by Marvel, written by Marvel — that are caught in between Marvel and Sony,” explained the actor at the Fan Expo Boston, as reported by Comic Book.\n\n\nVincent D'Onofrio also added that this setup between the two companies is why “it takes a long time for them to figure out who is doing what.” As for where Kingpin can show up, he said that he never really knows where it may happen.\n\n\n“My character is in that kind of situation, unlike Charlie's [Charlie Cox]. So I don't know, it's part of the deal when it comes to playing Kingpin,” said Vincent D'Onofrio.\n\n\nWhile Kingpin has been introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe through Hawkeye and Echo, Vincent D'Onofrio’s Kingpin will be in the spotlight once again in the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again show. Daredevil: Born Again is slated for a release in March 2025.\n\nThe post MCU actor Vincent D’Onofrio explains how Kingpin is affected by the complex Marvel and Sony situation appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer.

With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership.

The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.\n\n\nWhile the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create \"echoes\" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…",

The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.\nFor our review of the recent Metroid Prime remaster, head here.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. \nMistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.\nFantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.",

After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.\nTaking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.\nThough the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.",

However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.\nThe Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.\nThis isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.\nWe absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.",

The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. \n\n\nFollowing the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games).

Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.\nJoin us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.\nhttps://t.co/rYjTHHpayb pic.twitter.com/uAs6JYu31A\nJune 17, 2024\nWith the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company's fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it's likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. \nWith Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.",

          "description": "Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.\nThe first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. \n\n\nStealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). \nInterestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. \nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi \"Suda51\" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.\nAlongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. \nPlus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has \"auto rock on,\" an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. \nCheck all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. \n For more, read Game Informer's original Lollipop Chainsaw review here. \nAre you going to be playing Chainsaw Lollipop RePop this September?

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. \nThe update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. \n\n\nTo start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. \nThis upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. \nAre you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!",

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. \nFor the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. \n“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,\" said Linke. \"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
