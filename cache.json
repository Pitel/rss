          "description": "See how this new release compares to the original.\nOne of the surprises of Nintendo's recent Direct broadcast was the announcement Cing's classic point-and-click adventure series Another Code would be getting an enhanced release on the Nintendo Switch. It will contain the 2005 DS title Another Code: Two Memories (known as Trace Memory in North America) and the 2009 sequel Another Code: R – A Journey into Lost Memories from the Wii era.\nIf you're wondering just how much of an improvement the latest version is, the YouTube channel GameXplain has put together a side-by-side graphics comparison video showing the original DS release alongside the new Switch version. As you can see, this new version is a massive step up from the original. It's also changed the perspective slightly, so the third-person camera is now directly behind the characters.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Between The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fire Emblem Engage and Pikmin 4 (the less said about Vampire Survivors, the better), the hundreds of hours that I have poured into Nintendo's hybrid hardware far outweighs my time on any other console over the past nine months. But when it comes to my most-played game, it's a different story.\nYou see, despite all of these wonderful offerings from Nintendo this year, the game I have come back to every single day is not on the Switch, but rather on my phone. Just in case the above video hasn't spoilt it already, I am, of course, talking about Marvel Snap, the digital collectable card game from Second Dinner Studios and Nuverse. The title is weeks away from its one-year anniversary on 18th October and, following a successful launch of the PC version last month, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that a Switch port is on the cards.

From in-depth rules and systems, it takes a while to get into Gloomhaven and introducing new players to its dense combat can make multiplayer challenging. But also like a dense board game, Gloomhaven rewards you when you put in the work to learn its rules and systems. Its deep card-based tactics gameplay shines in its many modes.\nGloomhaven blends hexagonal, grid-based tactical gameplay with a truly unique card-based battling system that's deeply challenging, but also very rewarding once you manage to get a hold of all its moving parts. Its in-depth tutorial is largely okay at teaching you what you need to know, though not very quickly.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

          "description": "FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. \nRegardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.\nRead more",

          "description": "During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. \nI was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.\nRead more",

Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. \r\n\n\r\nI've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: \"Totally Fucked\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  \nAs with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.\nRead more",

Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?\r\n\n\r\nThing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake!

And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall.

          "description": "On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate \"Metascore\" as a kind of \"magic\". The FAQ cheekily invites you to \"peek behind the curtain\", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the \"weighting\" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.\nYou could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis - a sort of mobile gaming RPG sandwich of the original Final Fantasy VII and its spin-offs Crisis Core and The First Soldier, plus gacha mechanics - is coming to PC and Steam, publisher Square Enix have announced. The Steam release will share data with the mobile version.\r\n\n\r\n\r\nEver Crisis on mobile is a free-to-play game with microtransactions and curvy, colourful chibi-style visuals. It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups? Fingers crossed they'll rebadge it as a standard pay-upfront release and tear out all the gacha.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!\r\n\n\r\nThe game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island.\" To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.\nInstead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.\nBut this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.\nRead more",

On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.\nHello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.\nRead more",

          "description": "Reworked skill trees and new minigames aside, Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update includes a Ukrainian localisation of the game's million-plus-word script. It turns out the Ukrainian version is awash with references to Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine, all of it seemingly in support of the latter. The news comes via Zone of Games, who have published a few side-by-side comparisons from the game's files, underlining differences between the English and Ukrainian translations in various bits of dialogue and menu text.\nI asked the organisers of Indie Cup - a Kyiv, Ukraine-based digital festival of games like Pahris Entertainment's upcoming Space Wreck - to help me double-check the Ukrainian version's alterations. The Indie Cup team's Arsenii Tarasov was happy to oblige, and also volunteered a few further examples of more... adventurous localisation from his own research, supported with screenshots.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. \r\n\n\r\nPawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "My goodness, what a close thing. Fading Afternoon is a game of excellent vibes as you stroll around the city living your faintly sad life. It's also an incredibly cool 2D beat 'em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.\nIt's a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn't really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he's dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've played a few hours since Heretic's Fork launched yesterday and while it hasn't quite enraptured my hellbound heart, I am enjoying figuring it out—and seeing what my paperclip helper will do next.\nRead more",

Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.\r\n\nOr, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky \"RockyNoHands\" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.\nRead more",

          "description": "As part of the Realms Deep event, 3D Realms and Voidpoint have announced that the long-awaited expansion to 2019’s Ion Fury, Aftershock, will be released October 2, 2023. Happy Monday!\n\n\nIon Fury is a modern game built in Duke Nukem 3D’s legendary Build Engine. In a lot of ways, it’s a spiritual successor to Duke 3D. In fact, it would probably have been a Duke Nukem game if 3D Realms hadn’t handed the character over to Gearbox.\n\n\nInstead, you play as Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison. The expansion pack has her once again going up against her nemesis, Dr. Heskel. Beyond simply being a map pack, Aftershock adds new enemies, weapons, and a motorcycle for Shelly. Beyond that, there’s also a new difficulty and an “Arrange Mode” for the base game that lets you experience everything again in a remixed way.\n\n\n\n\nCool beans. I don’t think that Ion Fury is quite as great as Duke Nukem 3D – largely because of a harder-to-manage arsenal and less spectacular level design – but as a spiritual successor, it hit the mark. I mean, I think about it, and I’m like, this could have been Duke Nukem Forever. Instead of the mess we got, they could have given us something like this.\n\n\nHopefully, the Aftershock expansion improves things in some appreciable ways. I’m looking forward to it.  Also, note that this is a different game than Phantom Fury. That one is being done by Slipgate Ironworks and is more of a sequel.\n\n\nIon Fury: Aftershock releases October 2, 2023. Currently, it’s only for PC with no word on other platforms.\n\nThe post Ion Fury’s Aftershock expansion is out on October 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Alientrap, the devs behind Cryptark, are back for more. This time, it's taking its experience with procedural generation and giving it a first-person twist with a sequel titled Gunhead. Described as an \"FPS Jetpack Roguelike,\" the team's latest is now locked in for November 8 on PC and PlayStation 5. The release date was announced today during the Realms Deep digital event. You can see how it looks in action in the new trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nAs the preview shows, Alientrap is still all about blasting Mother Brains and other cybernetic monstrosities. The follow-up to Cryptark features procedurally generated starships and over 50 weapons and items to add to your loadout. For those who want to give it a shot, a demo is now live on Steam. \n\n\nLet's get ready to cyber-rumble\n\n\nThe setup for Gunhead has players boarding space-hulks and attempting to neutralize them. Doing so will net them more money for their Privateering enterprise. All of the obstacles — from security systems to cyborgs — lead to a battle with the Core. The setup is similar to Cryptark, which had you taking on salvage missions before tackling the massive alien title ship. That one was also procedurally generated, so anyone familiar with Alientrap's previous outing should feel at home here.\n\n\nCryptark was fast and frantic, so it looks like that's what they're going for with the sequel. Gunhead promises multiple enemy ship types, and we'll get to see how varied their challenges are when the full game launches. \n\nThe post Roguelike first-person shooter Gunhead set for November on PC, PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the Realms Deep stream, 3D Realms and Slipgate Ironworks have announced a release date for the remaster of Kingpin: Life of Crime. Named Kingpin: Reloaded, it’s set to release on December 5, 2023.\n\n\nKingpin: Life of Crime was originally released in 1999 by Interplay. It would prove to be the last game by developer Xatrix Entertainment before much of the staff was transferred to Activision under a studio known as Gray Matter Studios. Xatrix was known for the Redneck Rampage and Cyberia games.\n\n\n\n\nIt would largely be overshadowed by the more forward-thinking Half-Life, but Kingpin brought a few innovations of its own. It had side-quests, the Pawn-O-Matic shop system, and a skill system that has you starting off inexperienced with new weapons before gradually building up accuracy.\n\n\nThe remaster seems to essentially be targeting texture fidelity. The muddy filtered textures have been overhauled to look better at higher definitions. However, the wobble of the 3D objects still exists, which I find interesting. That’s not exactly unwelcome and probably the best we can hope for when it comes to the remaster of such a niche title. I’m just always happy to see a game get upgraded for modern systems.\n\n\nKingpin: Reloaded is chambered for a December 5, 2023 firing date. PC (via Steam) is the only listed platform.\n\nThe post Long delayed Kingpin: Reloaded now has a release date of December 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new skill trees present are Cyberpunk 2077's second overhaul after the 1.5 update initially changed them. \n\n\nSeeing Cyberpunk 2077's evolution is remarkable as someone who stuck with it since its disastrous launch. I revisited it often to see the new inclusions, slowly transforming Cyberpunk 2077 into a comfort game. Night City's streets and back alleys slowly burned into my memory as I drove across the neon-lit cityscapes, taking on gigs and taking a different route in the story. \n\n\nAdding onto this comfortable vibe, I almost always attempted the same build.

Frozen's Arendelle and five new characters from the popular animated franchise will appear this November. \n\n\nLater on, four racers from The Little Mermaid will emerge to the surface in January. Additionally, four mystery bonus characters will join mid-season.\n\n\nDisney Speedstorm just boosted out of the Early Access period and released its 1.0 version. This means that anyone can play the game under its free-to-play model. It's available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. There's also crossplay and cross-play functionality.\n\n\n\n\nTo help celebrate the launch, Gameloft announced its upcoming roadmap. We know that the environments from the undersea Atlantica and frozen tundra around Arendelle will emerge as two locations players will race around in. \n\n\nThe Disney Speedstorm roadmap also teases that new content will be released every two months.  \n\n\nAs part of Season 4 of the game, Disney fans can now race as Aladdin, Genie, Jasmine, and even Jafar. Four bonus characters, including Hades and Gaston, will be joining the game mid-season as well. The other two are a mystery right now. \n\n\nSo far, these are the Disney properties included in the game so far:\n\n\n\nMickey and friends\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean\n\n\nHercules\n\n\nBeauty and the Beast\n\n\nMulan\n\n\nLilo & Stitch\n\n\nThe Jungle Book\n\n\nMonster's Inc \n\n\nToy Story\n\n\nAladdin\n\n\n\nPerhaps one day, Gameloft will include Cars' Radiator Springs and 101 Dalmatians' London as race tracks in the future.\n\nThe post Disney Speedstorm roadmap includes Frozen and The Little Mermaid tracks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another patch just a couple of weeks after the 2.0 update dropped. Despite receiving a slew of gameplay overhauls and bug fixes, it can still be a glitchy game.\n\n\nCD Projekt Red announced the patch on its website with fixes both platform-specific and across all releases. Most of these aren't large improvements, ranging from adjusting radio songs' volume to properly initiating a glitched gig. One now-fixed bug I experienced is the distorted screen effect not disappearing after the Automatic Love quest.\n\n\nTwo notes are particularly notable as fairly big fixes, though.\n\n\nThe first is a nasty bug that corrupts PS5 saves for exceeding file limits, and the studio's solution is increasing the maximum size for files. Corrupted saves are unfortunately not recoverable, and CDPR recommends you keep a manual save before the corrupted point. \n\n\nMore so on the side of general improvements, performance should see a bump across all platforms, with upgrades to Dogtown, notably. It's technically an improvement throughout Cyberpunk's world, but Dogtown was highlighted as a notable area where issues occurred. \n\n\nThe post implies several smaller fixes are also on the way as CD Projekt Red mentions those noted are just the highlights. Another thing missing from the post is a specific release date for the patch other than it's coming soon.\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a far more stable release than in 2020, but it's great that CD Projekt Red is still regularly rolling out more fixes. It's not a surprise a content drop as big as Phantom Liberty introduced a few more problems the team is working on fixing. Hopefully, Cyberpunk 2077 will stand as a finely polished RPG by the time it's last fixes release.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 patch will fix bug corrupting PS5 saves, improve performance appeared first on Destructoid.",

This time around, the pair seeks to get to the bottom of a jewel theft, and judging by trailers, they're in for a big adventure. \n\n\nWith the release date just around the corner, Nintendo is celebrating by offering Detective Pikachu Returns icon elements. These can then be used to create custom user icons. The icon elements will come in waves, and first wave started yesterday and will run until October 5 at 5:59 PM PT. You can expect the next waves at the following times: \n\n\n\nWave 2: October 5 at 6:00 PM PT - October 12 at 5:59 PM PT\n\n\nWave 3: October 12 at 6:00 PM PT - October 19 at 5:59 PM PT\n\n\nWave 4: October 19 at 6:00 PM PT - October 26 at 5:59 PM PT\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll find the rewards by turning on your Switch and heading to the Nintendo Switch Online icon.

Scroll to the \"Missions & Rewards\" tab and you'll find the various icon elements there. \n\n\nYou won't have to pay for these icon elements, but they aren't free either. Images cost 10 Platinum Points, while backgrounds and frames cost 5 Platinum Points.

          "description": "It looks like cheating doesn’t pay, and Valve is out to prove it in Counter-Strike 2. In its first set of patch notes, Valve doesn't mince words; it's banning cheaters and penalizing parties caught benefiting from their activities.\n\n\nAs noted by IGN, Counter-Strike 2 cheaters risk more than just their own in-game freedom. Valve's update warns that when multiple people are caught cheating, players partied with them risk their own account status. The patch notes read: \n\n\n“When one or more party members get convicted of cheating and permanently banned, all their associates will be penalized with loss of Profile Rank and CS Rating\".\n\n\nIn addition to the cheater-by-association ban, the patch notes target folks hoping to piggyback their way through player rankings with higher-skilled friends. “In Premier, players with a very high established CS Rating are not allowed to party with accounts that do not have an established CS Rating.”\n\n\nIt seems this is part of Valve’s latest solution to address the lengthy history of cheating in the Counter-Strike community, though the CS2 developer doesn't really explain why or how you'll get flagged as an associate. The company implemented its first iterations of Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) back in 2002 and tuned the system into a cheat-seeking missle over the last decade. \n\n\nThese are but some of the changes, improvements, and bug fixes found in the first wave of Counter-Strike 2 updates. Valve, in very Valve behavior, launched Counter-Strike 2 at 4:40 p.m. ET on a Wednesday, officially retiring CS:GO.\n\nThe post Valve will penalize Counter-Strike 2 cheaters and their accomplices appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Own a Nintendo Switch, but have nothing to do this weekend? Well do we have news for you. From September 28 to October 3, anyone subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service can take the action/adventure RPG Eastward for a spin. \n\n\nEastward, developed by Pixpil Games and published by Chucklefish, is an RPG where players must find a way to escape an underground society that is on its way towards devastation. Here’s a full synopsis of Eastward from its dedicated website:\n\n\n\n“In the near-future, society is fast hurtling down the path of destruction. An unknown, toxic presence has spread and poisoned the air. Those who could escape flocked to villages underground to start a new life, and as new generations were forged, they soon forgot all memories of the blue skies above. But for a hardworking miner and a mysterious young girl, the hope of a thriving outside world beckons…\n\n\nEscape the tyrannical clutches of subterranean society and join Eastward’s unlikely duo, Sam and John, on an exciting adventure to the land above! Travel across the world by rail to uncover the mystery of Sam’s powers, and the truth behind the deadly miasma.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full-game trial\n\n\nAs usual with these promotions, those who purchase the game after playing this trial can carry over their progress. Additionally, the full game is discounted 50% through October 10, meaning you can nab this normally $24.99 game for $12.49. \n\n\nParticipants of the Game Trial can also acquire 100 My Nintendo Platinum Points. To earn these points, check out Missions & Rewards in the Nintendo Switch Online app on your console.\n\n\nEastward launched on September 16, 2021. In our review of the game, Eric Van Allen gave it an 8/10, saying “Eastward is something a fan of pixel art and good music, with a weakness for video game nostalgia, deserves to check out. It’s just also a journey that left me wanting a little more.”\n\nThe post Adventure game Eastward is free for Switch Online subscribers until October 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The release window is still penciled in for sometime in early 2024, but now a new demo offers a taste of adventure. Despite the fact that this one has curses, monsters, and other threats, there are plenty of opportunities to relax throughout. Check out some of the open-world crafting in action in the new trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nVexlands is billed as a \"cozy crafting adventure,\" but you'd be forgiven for not seeing much of that in the preview. Developer Emberheart Games is looking to strike a balance between cozy and perilous with this one. Sure, you could strike out in an attempt to explore the land and hunt for resources. You could also take some time to rest and relax in your ever-expanding homestead. Decorate your place, tame wild animals, fish, and farm if that's more to your liking.\n\n\nScreenshot via Apogee Entertainment\n\n\nAre you a cozy enough dude to cleanse the land?\n\n\nWhen you're done chilling, there's still going to be a world to save and tiles to unlock. Vexlands features procedurally generated environments with dynamic weather, and each area can unveil something either helpful or harmful. You might find artifacts hinting at the past, or precious resources for trading or crafting. Or you might run into some nasty enemies or a sudden strike of lightning. You can roll the dice yourself with the demo, which is live on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.

In the past, we’ve reported on the virtual reality version of the hit party game coming to Steam and Meta Quest, but now that the PSVR2 has been out for a while, it’d seem Sony is hitting the Emergency Alert button and planning a release for its headset.\n\n\nIn the PlayStation blog, Kat De Shields-Moon and Adam Kuta of Schell Games who, alongside Innersloth and Robot Teddy, represent a third of Among Us VR’s developers, confirmed the game will cost $9.99 when it launches for PSVR2. Outside of a \"coming soon\" promise, it's when Among Us VR will launch, but we do know that this version of the game arrives with two maps: The Skeld II and Polus Point.\n\n\n\n\nThe Skeld II is, of course, based on the infamous map of a similar name. Polus Point, on the other hand, is also based on the Polus map from the original game, but it “features 50% more tasks, nine new rooms with *cough* delicious hidden objects, and brand-new kill and ejection animations,” according to De Shields-Moon and Kuta.

          "description": "Insomniac Games has announced several new accessibility options for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Most of the support expands on systems found in previous Spider-Man games and other Insomniac titles like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.\n\n\nThe announcement came via the PlayStation Blog with Insomniac developers over accessibility design and UX, explaining expanded functionality and those uses. \n\n\nAlongside the difficulty settings in prior games, Spider-Man 2 also features what Insomniac calls Challenge Level Modifiers. These allow for aspects such as enemies' health, damage, and awareness to receive some finer tweaking.\n\n\nFeatures like Chase Assist alter chases to give players an advantage, such as slowing down the target's top speed. Repeated button presses from QTEs can also be changed to button taps or holds. There's even room to adjust Spider-Man 2's gameplay speeds, with options to play at 70, 50, or 30 percent of the original, real-time rates.\n\n\nAudio settings are adjustable, too, with high or low-frequency sounds having a toggle. There's even a filter for notch frequency to remove certain frequency ranges.\n\n\nOther features will make it into the game after launch. One of these is audio descriptions featuring a voice-over narrating cutscenes and QTEs. The other is a screen reader featuring audio descriptions for elements like tutorials or menus. Those two are especially helpful for blind players but are not coming on launch. Instead, they are a part of an update coming in December 2023.\n\n\nIncreased accessibility in games is always a great thing to hear. It helps expand a game's potential audience who otherwise might have trouble with certain elements. Hopefully, Insomniac's accessibility support works as intended to make playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 as comfortable as possible when it releases October 20 for PS5. \n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 expands accessibility support with level modifiers, screen readers, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not only is the spritely pink hedgehog playable in the upcoming Sonic Superstars, but she co-stars in the biggest Sonic Frontiers update, out today on all platforms. She struts her stuff in the Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon update trailer, along with Tails, Knuckles, and Sonic.\n\n\nAmy brings some new tools to the combat trade in the update. She's paired with her iconic hammer, but she also wields a set of cards to liven up the action. Not content with using them to attack enemies, she can also swirl them around like helicopter blades to give her more jump distance. Amy can also gain some intense speed by turning them into an exercise wheel of sorts — oddly appropriate for a hedgehog.\n\n\n\n\nAmy, Tails, and Knuckles return to give a hand in Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon update trailer\n\n\nOf course, we also have Tails and Knuckles. The latter brings his fists to the fight, while Tails returns rocking the Tornado 2 mech. I don't recall seeing that thing since Sonic Adventure 2. In Sonic Frontiers, the transformer plane looks like an optional summon. Tails can use it to fly around in the world, but we don't see how it fares in combat. \n\n\nImage via Sega.\n\n\nSonic Frontiers: The Final Update trailer offers a glimpse of what it's bringing to the table.

          "description": "If you needed a reason to become an early adopter of the Meta Quest 3, here’s one: Xbox Cloud Gaming is on its way to the next gen headset. \n\n\n\n\nIn a post by the official Meta Quest VR account on Twitter, the company confirmed that players can soon experience games like Halo Infinite, Starfield, and Forza Motorsport on the device. Furthermore, the attached video showcases how the virtual screen should look in a mixed reality environment. \n\n\nThis news, in particular, is actually a long time coming. Back in October of 2022, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that Xbox Cloud Gaming would appear on the platform. Then, during this year's Meta Connect Keynote presentation, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the service will launch in December. This was, admittedly, a small note in a long presentation, so no details were revealed that the Twitter post didn't already cover.\n\n\nXbox Cloud Gaming is currently included as a part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which costs $16.99 per month. The Meta Blog confirms that this same subscription service will work here. Do note that players will also need a \"supported controller,\" which presumably means something Xbox compatible.\n\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 will launch on October 10. Preorders are available now, with prices starting at $499.99.\n\nThe post Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to Meta Quest 3 this December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.\nPhantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The company cites \"lower profitability of the European region.\" \nAs a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. \n\n\n\"We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.,\" a Sega press release reads. \"We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision.\" \nSega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that \"there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time.\" \nSega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.",

Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. \nThere's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. \nCheck out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. \nIn the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well.

His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. \nAs for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. \nHere's Platinum's statement: \npic.twitter.com/GHiSugPF42\nSeptember 25, 2023\nAnd here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: \nHowever, I feel this outcome is for the best.\nSeptember 25, 2023\nBefore co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. \nKamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.\nWhile waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101.

The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.\nThe RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. \nIn the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. \nAssassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer. \nAre you going to check out Assassin's Creed Nexus VR in November?

Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed \"to ensure thorough testing.\" This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.\nWhile we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. \nWith Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!\npic.twitter.com/LJ6y9CZ58F\nSeptember 21, 2023\nEven though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.",

The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
